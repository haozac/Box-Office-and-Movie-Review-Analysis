       "[<div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">As of today, there are 2675 reviews for \"Avatar\"--many of them excellent and by reviewers I respect and enjoy. Because this film has been reviewed so many times and I am so late in seeing it, I will make review VERY quick, as there isn't a whole lot more I can say that hasn't already been said.<br/><br/>Although I have almost 10000 reviews to my credit (making me a real nut-case!), I rarely ever see blockbuster films. Heck, I've never seen \"Jurassic Park\" and I mostly only go to theaters to see movies my daughters want to see or the Oscar-nominated shorts that are shown each winter. So the fact that I never saw \"Avatar\" in the theaters isn't very surprising. Any why, then, did I see the film? Well, Netflix (or more likely the Post Office) made a mistake!! I was supposed to watch an Ealing Studios comedy (just the sort of thing a film snob would adore) but the package was ripped open--and \"Avatar\" was inside! While I should have seen it in 3-D on a huge screen, I fortunately at least saw it on a 58\" TV---the best I could hope for instead of the theater. In fact, I would say that if you only have a small TV, don't even bother as the graphics are the big reason to see the film--not the story. Additionally, James Cameron achieved something never achieved before (and hopefully which can now be achieved again thanks to CGI)--he's made sci-fi no longer the realm of humans or human-like beings. So much of the world in this film is 100% alien--something common in books but NEVER on TV or in films. Because of these factors, the film MUST be seen--even if the story, unfortunately, is a bit simplistic with its 'people are stupid and lack TRUE insight' plot. I would have liked the aliens teaching the humans much (like they did in the film) but less of the 'noble savage' idea that people have nothing to offer in exchange. While I do agree people are sometimes stupid, it just seemed a bit too black &amp; white in its thinking and, as a result, lacks depth when it comes to the otherwise fascinating story. For example, the boss-man in charge of the operation comes off as a walking stereotype--like G.I. Joe on steroids and not a real person.<br/><br/>Excellent...but flawed. Next time (and the director has announced there will be at least two follow-up films), I sure hope they spend some more of the one hundred bazillion dollar budget on better writing--as the characters were too often one-dimensional and the macho fight at the end just seemed...well...stupid and clichéd. More well-rounded and real and I would have given this film a 10--perhaps the next ones will earn this distinction.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I did see Avatar for the first time a while ago, and didn't know what to make of it. To me it felt like a visual feast if little else. Re-watching it again, I found more strengths, but there are several weaknesses that prevent it from being a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Starting with Avatar's strengths, it is absolutely mind-blowing visually. The cinematography, landscapes, scenery, colours, make-up and effects are outstanding and are by far and away Avatar's strongest asset. I also liked the score, it is certainly not the best score I have ever heard, but it had some very nice moments, while Cameron's direction is competent, the message admirable, and the finale well and truly explosive. I also loved the flying sequences, they were breathtaking.<br/><br/>The acting in general is a mixed bag. Sam Worthington is a charismatic enough lead, while Zoe Saldana is strong and spirited. Stephen Lang is an enjoyable and over-the-top villain of the piece too, however Sigourney Weaver is somewhat so-so, doesn't help really her character isn't that interesting while Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore aren't given very much to do.<br/><br/>What didn't work so well is that Avatar's story, with themes of love in a time of chaos and man alone in a hostile environment, is rather simplistic and predictable. I also felt it took a while to get going, and that the relationship between Jake and Neytiri was on the dull side. And is it me, or does this film drag at times, particularly towards the end? Now don't get me wrong, I liked the concept, it wasn't exactly original, as I often heard it described as \"Dances with Wolves in Space with rip-offs of Pocahontas and FernGully\"- but I am not going to join those who say that- I have to admit regardless of its originality or lack of it the concept intrigued me. Then there is the dialogue, which is nothing special and never quite rings true. There are some amusing moments but a vast majority of the dialogue in the middle of the film never quite convinced or came across as cheesy. The characters also came across as rather clichéd, especially Giovanni Ribisi's, and the character development was lacking.<br/><br/>So all in all, Avatar does have a lot of strengths, but a lot of weaknesses too. I will say I preferred it over The Hurt Locker, which to be honest left me cold, but I think I would be stretching it a bit if I said it was 5-star masterpiece. 6/10 Bethany Cox</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar (2009) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>A paraplegic marine (Sam Worthington) gets a shot to continue his career by taking part in an experiment that will place him among the people of Pandora. Once there he has orders to learn their way of life so that the military can eventually throw them off their land but soon the marine begins to feel that the Pandora way of life is the way to be. Okay, I'll admit that I was very skeptical going into this movie after hearings months worth of buzz saying this film was going to change the way we view movies. I became even more skeptical after it became a hit and just recently became the most successful film in history. This type of movie normally isn't my cup of tea but I was left amazed countless times and in the end I have to admit that Cameron has done it again. There are only a handful of films that actually change the ways movies are made. We can look at 1915's THE BIRTH OF A NATION as one. GONE WITH THE WIND would be another. I have no doubt in my mind that AVATAR is another film in line with those two classics and I'm sure one day people will study this movie just as we have studied those other two for decades now. <br/><br/>I'm not a fan of CGI but what we have here is something truly amazing because it doesn't look like something fake nor does it seem like a phony marketing device. As the movie goes along Cameron does such a masterful job at building this alternate life that one really begins to forget that they're watching a movie. I've heard stories of people becoming depressed after watching this movie when they realize that Pandora isn't real and I understand how some could feel this way. While watching the movie there wasn't a single second where the idea of me watching something fake entered my mind. The characters, their wildlife, the forest and all the creates in that forest were extremely real to me and the way Cameron brings all of this to life constantly had my jaw on the floor and my eyes bugged out. I honestly don't think I blinked once during this film because I was worried about missing something that I hadn't seen before. The amazing neon colors of the flowers or the look of the glowing eyes, no matter what you're looking at on the screen you can't help but feel as if you're seeing something for the first time and it's unlike anything you've seen before. This alternate lifestyle or universe that Cameron has created is something truly breathtaking and something you want to take it as much as you can.<br/><br/>The 3-D effects are also masterfully done because Cameron doesn't just sit there and throw things out you. With only a couple exceptions, the 3-D is only used to put you into this universe and I must admit that I've never seen 3-D like this and I can only hope more movies will use it to this effect. The 160-minute running time flashes by without any slow spots and the performances are all top-notch with Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang really delivering the goods. The music score by James Horner is epic and Mauro Fiore's cinematography really puts you in the center of all the action. Many have complained that the story is pretty unoriginal and light, which might be true but it really doesn't take away from the film as it's still good enough to keep you interested in the characters, their actions and everything they're feeling. Walking out of this movie I really did feel like what those in 1915 would have felt coming out of THE BIRTH OF A NATION. I felt as if I had seen something not only epic but groundbreaking and the start of something new in cinema history. Perhaps Kubrick's 2001 also made people feel this way. Either way, a lot of credit has to go to Cameron who has once again delivered something truly special.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It's impossible to watch AVATAR for the first time – especially a good two years after it first came out – without being influenced by all the fuss surrounding it, with endless critics, fans and reviewers praising it as a game-changing FX movie, a film heralding in a new era of cinematic spectacle, the best movie of all time, yada yada yada. Such praise invariably leaves me cold, which is why I finally caught up with this film not in the cinema but on television during its debut showing. I was in no hurry.<br/><br/>My thoughts? AVATAR is a decent film, yes, and one that's highly entertaining – but it's no masterpiece. Cameron works hard and puts in a great deal of effort as director, but it doesn't come close to the strength and power of his earlier one-two pairing, THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS. AVATAR is a film that works on a superficial level as long as you don't think about it too much, and the overly familiar storyline has already been done before in the likes of DANCES WITH WOLVES. Except Cameron had the clever idea of transporting the action to an alien planet and hoping nobody would notice. And you know what? It seems nobody – or very few people - actually did.<br/><br/>Does the somewhat slim storyline justify the rather excessive running time? I'm not entirely sure it does. The beginning feels a little slow and the whole fish-out-of-water premise involving the central character's induction to the alien society is rather familiar. Much of the film just seems like an excuse to show off the CGI effects, which are admittedly impressive although not quite as lifelike as Cameron would have you believe. I'd still have preferred them to use unadulterated human actors for the aliens, rather than converting the performances by the actors into pure CGI, but then you can't have anything.<br/><br/>As is usual with Cameron, the film is more about the technology and the science rather than the characters. The actors don't make a great deal of impact, it has to be said; the dull Sam Worthington made his name with this and TERMINATOR: SALVATION, two films which barely require him to act. Still, Sigourney Weaver is on hand to show him how it's done, and Stephen Lang makes a great villain, as always (I still remember him from the likes of Steven Seagal actioner FIRE DOWN BELOW in the '90s, and I guess it took a while for everyone else to catch up). It's hard to assess the performers playing the aliens because the effects are just too distracting.<br/><br/>At its heart, AVATAR is a simple and straightforward action film, offering the kind of breakneck, breathtaking effects-infused sequences that highlighted TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. It's admittedly beautiful to watch, particularly the alien landscapes brought stunningly to life and the various creatures that inhabit them. The action is engaging, particularly the extensive climax in which the speed picks up a gear and Cameron really lets loose with all kinds of pyrotechnic mayhem. The climax, which seems to run for about forty minutes, displays a willingness to dispatch important characters in a realistic and gritty way, really ending the movie on a high and leaving the viewer with a good impression. It may be familiar – too much so in places – but as a piece of spectacle, AVATAR ticks all the right boxes.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is paralyzed. When his brother is killed, he is offered an opportunity to take his place on the faraway planet Pandora. The company is mining valuable unobtanium and they are encroaching the local aliens Na'vi. Avatars are genetically engineered alien look-alike with both alien genes and human genes. Jake is similar enough to his brother to take over his Avatar. Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) leads a team to connect with the natives and find a diplomatic solution. As he gets to know the locals, it becomes harder to bridge the divide.<br/><br/>The story is not as impressive. This is simplistic native warriors against big bad corporate land rapers. While the visuals are amazing, this is a long winded version of other movies like 'Dances with Wolves'. The big drawback for me is Sam Worthington. While the technology is there to give the avatars emotions, Sam isn't a good enough actor to take full advantage.<br/><br/>This is one of the first motion captured performance that actually looks natural. The amount of CGI is impressive. The amount of skills and technology involved to put this movie together is a big step forward. Compared to the stuff that Robert Zemeckis does, the big difference is the faces. James Cameron brings real emotions to his CGI characters that is still missing from Zemeckis. The world of Pandora looks amazing and lush. It has enough fantasy and realism. It represented a new high point of 3D. It is a visual triumph.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This is a remarkable experience, like watching Niagara Falls. I am tired of special effects, but this has soul. Do the people that don't like the story resent the environmental vs. military part of it or what. Cameron has created a new race, a new language, and extrapolated a future. Of course he borrows from other sources. The last original thing I read was by Marshall McLuhan in 1964. Anyone who writes anything epic borrows from the ancient Greeks for God's sake. This is full of spectacle, \"humanity,\" and tension. The alien culture is greatly developed. I'm surprised that Anne McCaffrey fans aren't complaining. Yes, there are dragons and they bond with their masters. The final battle scene is incredible. We have a great GI Joe villain, and invalid set free from his infirmity by sloughing into a new body, a cool scientist with a harsh edge (Sigourney Weaver) and a theme that things aren't as simple as we would hope they would be. I saw this in 3D and found it to be wonderful. Still, while I seldom see a movie a second time in the theater, I will go to this again and watch it in its standard format. I think it might be a bit more liberating.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">high technology. imaginative director. tasteful cocktail of myths, ecology and defense of basic values of human kind. against every critic, it is an amazing show. seductive, touching, maybe not profound but convincing. it is easy to blame it and it is easy to proclaim it as masterpiece. if you ignore its purpose. because the film has the admirable virtue to propose new measure unit in cinematography. than - to give the best image to a lot of problems of every day news. not the least, to give a challenge. to public, critics and cultural media . and that fact is the only important. because, fan or enemy of Cameron vision, it remains not easy to ignore. because it represents a new mythology, inspired mixture of elements from Sci Fi and old fairy tales.the only problem - maybe Sam Wortihington. but, in few decades, each error becomes a virtue.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Avatar\" is an American movie from 2009 and still the most recent blockbuster movie by writer and director James Cameron. He dominated the awards season over a decade earlier with \"Titanic\" already and things looked similar back in 2010 when only \"The Hurt Locker\" managed to keep \"Avatar\" from winning all the very big prizes. Ironically enough, the former was made by Cameron's ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow which made for some interesting references (and bad jokes) at the Oscars back then. But still \"Avatar\" won three trophies at the Oscars alone and many many more during other big awards ceremonies. There are several versions out there of this film when it comes to the runtime and the longest is probably the director's cut that comes incredibly close to the massive 3-hour mark. Your choice if you want to go for this one or the original theatrical release for example. You can decide it perhaps if you plan on rewatching this extremely long and extremely blue movie before the sequels come out as it seems Cameron still wants to follow through with his plan of releasing no less than four sequels to \"Avatar\" until 2025 that he has worked on in the last decade.<br/><br/>The cast includes Sam Worthington who is the lead actor here and it is definitely the by far biggest work of his career. Add to that Cameron's longtime collaborator Sigourney Weaver and relatively young actors like Giovanni Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez or Zoe Saldana. The main antagonist is played by Stephen Lang who, as usual, elevates the material. Oh yeah, CCH Pounder is on board too and deserves the mention for sure. Basically, there are two kinds of people when it comes to \"Avatar\", those who really absolutely love the movie and think it is a revelation and then those who think it is all pretense and nothing special at all. So it sure is a clash of extremes and I personally would say they are both in the wrong. The right approach is somewhere in-between. \"Avatar\" is a movie that is breathtakingly beautiful on many occasions and that offers a solid story that is nothing too great though. But it also offers basically fight and war sequences for 45 minutes or so, basically the entire last third of the movie. And this is where the film somehow lost me to be honest. It is just too long for basically nothing but action scenes, even if lots of important stuff (deaths mostly) happens during that time.<br/><br/>As for the film's frequently discussed environmental message, I am a bit undecided. I think the general concept of showing how humans (or Na'vi) should live in peace with nature and all its creatures, plants and animals, is a honorable one, but it is also pretty simple because you could wonder the extent to which the taming, i.e. the violent submission, works against this principle for example. But you could write pages on this subject to be honest, alone about this movie, and at times I must say I think it takes itself more seriously than it should given the substance it has and messages it is sending. I read frequently that people compare this film to \"Pocahontas\", but it's been so long that I have seen the latter (Have I at all?), so I cannot really elaborate on the subject. I think \"Avatar\" offers enough to enjoy the movie as its own creative achievement and even if it has sequences during which it drags a bit, it is still very much worth watching, preferably on the big screen. If you have a chance to do so (again), then don't miss out.<br/><br/>To everybody who hasn't seen \"Avatar\" yet (if there are actually people out there that fit this description), maybe wait until the new films come out and then I am sure many cinemas will show this original film before and you can watch it there and then decide if you are interested in more. This is (as almost always with Cameron) by no means an actors' movie, even if some have baity material. It is really all about the messages and the world and the environment in this movie. All about the visual side basically. A whole new world. Maybe not a whole new movie as there are considerable weaknesses in here without a doubt. One of the better, but not very best films of 2009 I would say, one that deserves neither all the hate nor all the praise it's been getting. And for closure, let me say that the song during the closing credits is also pretty amazing to listen to.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've been badgered to see this film for years, and when I finally do, I come out of it fairly impressed, but something tells me that this plot line is a tale as old as time. Another case of \"Uh oh, there goes the neighborhood\". The dreaded earthling, apparently already having destroyed their own planet, settles on what appears to be the moon of a huge planet called Pandora, and decides to take over. The best way to interact with the residents of this colorful planet is something called an avatar, or fake body in which the soul of an earthling is suddenly put into the avatar, a proxy of what the residents of this place looks like. <br/><br/>The avatars interact with the residents, feel everything they do, but when the day is over and the human soul wakes up, the avatar simply passes out as their soul has been removed. Then a ruthless marine commander decides that the residents of this planet need to move from where they are, and the scientist (Sigourney Weaver) running the avatar program objects, leading her and a crippled marine (Sam Worthington) to steal one of the marines' aircraft to warn the natives and prevent the nasty Stephen Lang, the colonel who has no regards for the residents, the native American like Na'vi, turning this into a modern science fiction version of many classic westerns.<br/><br/>This takes time to build, but once Worthington is in his avatar body, the action really takes off, especially after he meets Na'vi princess Zoe Saldana. The strong Saldana, seeing Worthington as a \"baby\", educates him after her parents, the clan and spiritual leaders of the tribe, insist that he is now one of them. Of course, Saldana already has an admirer, promised as her mate, and this sets up potential rivalry. But as Lang's anger towards the betrayal of Weaver, Worthington and the few who followed them out grows, so does the violence, and it's up to this small group of avatars to warn the tribe to get out before its too late, because the power of Lang's weapons of mass destruction knows no barriers. <br/><br/>As I am not a huge fan of modern CGI or the loud special effects that have overtaken modern cinema, I have avoided many films like this over the past decade, but on home video, find you can easily control the volume rather than be blasted by theater speakers. I instantly recognized the plot structure from many films over the years, but was impressed by the colorful photography and human way the natives were presented, instantly correlating it with real earth native American tribes, so often abused and misunderstood in Hollywood movies. The script is indeed better than I expected, and I was grabbed emotionally nearly from the start. Like other blockbuster franchises, I suspect that future entries in this film series will not nearly be as powerfully ingrained on my memory, and I hope that the time is taken to write great stories with great scripts that won't rely on old tricks and thus become a pale imitation of this film which for future generations should be seen on a large screen to get the full impact, something I missed.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">In a futuristic society ruled by the economical and military powers, the paraplegic marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) travels to the distant satellite of Saturn Pandora to participate in the research of Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and her team of scientists that are studying the environment and the humanoids that inhabit the forest. Jake had decided to take the place of his twin brother after his death in a robbery, and use his expensive Avatar, a sort of surrogate of the Omaticaya tribe that is embodied through the transference of the human conscience. In the facility, Jake meets the greedy representative of the powerful corporation Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) that expects to expel the Na'vi from their lands that to mine the wealthy ore underground. Jake is approached by Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) that asks him to learn the habits and culture of the Na'vi and to send a daily report to him; in exchange, he would get an expensive spine surgery for him to walk again. Jake meets the leery Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), the daughter of the chief of the Na'vi, in the forest and little by little Jake forms close ties with the natives and falls in love for Neytiri. When Colonel Quaritch collects enough information about the Na'vi, he decides to use the force to drive them out of their lands.<br/><br/>I have just watched \"Avatar\" on DVD and the question that is drumming into my head is how can this film have not wined the Oscar 2010 of best motion picture of the year? The weak \"The Hurt Locker\" in Brazil was released straight to video while \"Avatar\" has been in the movie theaters for months (and still is). And both are about the external diplomatic policy of bombing to take (in Iraq and in the metaphoric Pandora - who was entrusted with a box where all the evils of human life are kept) but with different conclusions, since Eywa has a different attitude and helps the worshipers. Now I can understand the deserved hype surrounding \"Avatar\" that won three (3) Oscars and another twenty-eight (28) awards and had fifty- three (53) nominations. The original ecological and mystical story is fascinating with wonderful visual conception. As highlighted by another user, \"Avatar must be seen and cannot be described\". The Canadian James Cameron has really written and directed an outstanding feature. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): \"Avatar\"<br/><br/>On 08 January 2011, I saw \"Avatar\" again, now on Blu-Ray.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Although I was not too bothered about seeing Avatar as a film, I felt it was a bit foolish to let this milestone of cinema go past me – particularly when the thing it is hyped for are the effects and being the first \"big\" film to utilise 3D technology to this degree. It just seemed that watching it on my TV in about 9 months on DVD with a basic stereo system would be missing the point. Unsurprisingly I was right because Avatar is technically a brilliant film that deserves to sweep the Oscars in terms of awards for visual effects and other such categories.<br/><br/>If we ignore the 3D for a minute, the actual effects look great and I imagine that it will still be impressive in 2D. The landscapes and world of Pandora are imaginative (ironic since how dumb the name of it is) and very vividly created to the point where you forget that they are effects when you step back from them. Likewise it is so easy to forget that the Na'vi are not actors in quite brilliant outfits and makeup because they look so real and move so naturally – it is a million miles from the films such as Spiderman or Indy 4 where you can see where the real person ends and the jumping/swinging special effect begin. There were points in the film where I found myself wondering how on earth they managed to get a particular shot and where the camera was, only for my brain to kick in a second later to remind me that what I'm seeing is entirely virtual. OK the fantastical visual aspects are clearly creations but I was startled by how accepting of it all was and, in 2D I thought that the effects were pretty seamless.<br/><br/>In 3D it doesn't quite hit the same mark for me. The \"look it's in 3D\" shots are not as obvious as some of the other films (where stuff comes out of the screen for no reason) but it is still a little distracting when the 3D forces your focus or has stuff where it doesn't aid the scene. Of course the world of Pandora looks great with things moving around in front of you and the final battle sequences are great – the money is all there to be seen. Thing is, the reason I was able to think about \"how did they do that shot\" while watching the film is because the technical aspects of the film is really all there is to engage with. The plot is basic and obvious – others have talked at length about the rights and wrongs of a story where the white man comes to the aid of the indigenous people, so I'll not add to that debate. The problem for me is simpler than that, it is simply that the plot is weak and the script is just as weak. My girlfriend laughed out loud when the name of the mineral on Pandora was named as \"Unobtainium\" and there were plenty of things like this. The dialogue between the characters is full of needless plot exposition and thus doesn't ring true. Of course all this is helped by the action and the effects but the narrative and writing weaknesses are all I can think of when I have to listen to people tell me how Avatar is the best film ever.<br/><br/>The cast manage to do solid jobs considering how easy it is for them to get lost in the effects (see the modern Star Wars films to see this happen). Worthington is stuck with some awful dialogue but he is a good presence even in his Avatar. Saldana's performance is good, again despite some of her expressions and dialogue. Weaver is \"so-so\", Moore is pointless, Ribisi is miscast in a character that is so clichéd that it needed a decent casting to make it be more than it was. I liked Lang a lot and his OTT badass character worked well. Rodriguez seems like she is there because someone important likes her and her character doesn't add a terrible lot. Voice work from Studi, Pounder and others is good.<br/><br/>Overall Avatar deserves to be seen for its technical importance and how impressive it is but the degree of praise for it needs to be put in context by considering how it plays as more than just a special effects milestone. In these terms it is not as good due to a poor plot and script that hurts the actors more than the effects do by handing them some awful dialogue. That it works is testament to how impressive the effects are but there is not a terrible lot to gush about beyond these.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Quite a lot has been said and written about this movie. It's a fact that it has broken all the records (except at the Oscars, which might have saved us a King of the World/Universe speech by Mr. Cameron), that it's loved by many, but despised by quite a lot also. While the story is not Original (it's not like there are that many Original stories lying around waiting to be made), the technical achievements have to be seen! <br/><br/>Yes the story seems to be just another take on the Pocahontas story, but does that make the movie itself bad from the get go? I don't think so. After watching it a second time (at the theaters), I have to say, that there are quite a few nuances to the story, that are quite nice. Two lines from the beginning are kind of setting the tone, which you only realize when you watch it a second time.<br/><br/>The 3-D Effects are great, but subtle and it was no surprise that they won at this years Academy Awards. While I still felt that the Navi \"people\" didn't feel entirely realistic, it didn't feel wrong either. The graphics fitted into the whole Fantasy vibe the movie had going for it (at least that's how I felt, when I watched it). They weren't photo-realistic, but they were good enough.<br/><br/>If you like a movie to be more low key, you should check \"Battle for Terra\", an animated Feature, that has a similar overall story and came out prior to Avatar and therefor shouldn't be judged by a technical viewpoint/comparison to Avatar. That being said, I hope a future Blu Ray (DVD) Release of the movie will revolutionize the TV market and if we are lucky enough, the extended cut of the movie, might surface at the cinemas at/near the end of 2010. I'm looking forward to that, although I'm a bit skeptical about the love scene, that is apparently going to make it into that cut ...<br/><br/>Edit: Looks like we have been \"lucky\" enough ... though I would argue with that myself now. After having watched the movie for a third time (the last one being the extended cinema cut), I kinda began to dread the experience. It's just too much for me. Even on the IMAX screen in London and even while recognizing many (most?) of the new inserted scenes. And there is even a bigger cut out on DVD/Blu Ray. Though the 3-D version will not be released before 2011. I personally can't watch it again for another 2 years ... or else I would have to re-evaluate and cut off a point or two ...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I have never, ever gone to a movie before based on it's pre-opening hype until today. Not that I couldn't have waited, but the opportunity presented itself, and I was already inclined to see it based on some of the positive stuff I've read about the film and James Cameron's ten year mission to 'get it done right'.<br/><br/>The results for me are mixed. Going on the basis of technical wizardry, CGI effects and brilliant use of color, the film scores high. But when you get right down to it, the story is entirely derivative of themes that have been done numerous times before. Without exaggeration, virtually every movie Western ever made had at it's core a similar plot line - whether it be a battle over land rights, water rights, gold mines, or the inevitable clash of ranchers versus open range cattlemen. Chalk this one up to the all inclusive mineral rights category. With energy supplies back on Earth entirely depleted, the planet Pandora offers a rare commodity valued at twenty million dollars a pound. It's called unobtanium. Unobtanium? As in it's so valuable that it's unobtainable except at supreme sacrifice in life and property?<br/><br/>This all might not have been so clichéd if there was even a single element of originality to the story. OK, you have your tricked out mix and match dinosaur knock-offs, like the hammerhead triceratops, but come on. What almost saves the picture from it's overbearing two and a half hour run time is it's exquisite use of day-glo neon and fluorescent color, even though none of it relates to anything in the 'real' world. Which is fine from the perspective of creating a visually stunning landscape coming straight from the creator's imagination. However as I think about it now, I was more impressed with the extraordinarily vibrant use of natural color in a couple of martial arts films, \"Hero\" and \"House of Flying Daggers\".<br/><br/>And then there's the relationship between Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and the Na'vi princess Neytiri. Here's the mental leap of faith you have to take, and no one seems to have thought about it. Jake Sully is a HUMAN BEING, given a synthetic Na'vi body to integrate with the Pandoran population. He eventually becomes romantically involved with Neytiri, an entirely different, ten foot tall species. How exactly does that work? <br/><br/>Say, let's get back to my earlier mention of the Western genre. When it came down to the final battle, it struck me rather odd that the Na'vi's donned war paint just like Indians would. Not only that, but in the heat of battle, Neytiri and the other Na'vi women turned into vampires. With a ten year time span to think about all this, it seemed oddly convenient that Cameron wound up taking advantage of the Twilight craze.<br/><br/>Finally, and this is a big finally, couldn't the dialog go beyond every known clichéd line in the book? Really, there were so many that it was impossible to keep track. I do remember Colonel Quaritch's \"Come to Papa\" during the final battle, and I just groaned. The only one missing was 'Lock and Load' and seriously, that single line would have lowered my rating for the picture a full point.<br/><br/>None of the foregoing should be construed as a recommendation not to see the picture, because I think you'll have to judge it for yourself. It's just that I expected more, and keeping in mind the current political and financial mess that the country is in, I do hope the picture succeeds. I'd hate to think that James Cameron would need a bail out for a picture too big to fail.</div>,\n",

There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of driving off the native humanoid Na'vi in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland.<br/><br/>This film was pretty good when it was released the first time and called \"Ferngully\". This time, it is a thinly veiled political message with some awful animation. Iam aware of the work that went into it, but it still ends up looking like a cartoon, which is a failed endeavor.<br/><br/>\"I can watch films and say how technically beautiful they are, but I'm not impressed by any technicality,\" said Abbas Kiarostami.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated director James Cameron (The Terminator, Aliens) returned after a twelve year absence, from Titanic, with this 3D film that was rumoured would change the way films (particularly in 3D) are made, I had to see what the big deal was. Basically, it is 2154, where paraplegic war veteran, marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is being recruited for a mission to the alien planet Pandora, inhabited by the native humanoid race called Na'vi with their own language and culture. To get onto the planet without suspicion, he, fellow soldier Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) and experienced Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) enter a cocoon have their minds enter a new body known as an Avatar to look like the alien race,and control is by telepathy, so Jake can walk again in this body. The mission is to first understand more about the Na'vi, Jake manages to gain the trust of Neytiri (Zoë Saldana) and eventually the rest of them, and to find a precious mineral called Unobtanium. As time goes by, it becomes obvious that Jake is enjoying life in the Avatar as a Na'vi a bit too much for the likes of Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who promised Jake his real legs back, and Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi). They are turning nasty to get what they want and start stripping the planet, so Jake, Trudy Chacon (Michelle Rodriguez) and the whole of the Na'vi form an army to go against the enemy (the humans) to save what is precious, Pandora itself. Also starring CCH Pounder as Moat, Wes Studi as Eytukan and Laz Alonso as Tsu'tey. 2009 also saw this film break the worldwide record for highest grossing film in the world and of all time, with over $2 billion, ironically beating Cameron's own Titanic (which made over $1 billion). As for the film itself, it might not be the most original of plots, but the performances are good, and the big hook is seeing the amazing special effects take you into another world. The motion-capture is really well done for the blue characters, and the 3D really adds to the beautiful landscapes and colours of the alien world, oh, and for the quite gripping action scenes, so it is an epic science-fiction fantasy to see. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Music, Original Score for James Horner, Best Sound, Best Sound Editing, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design, and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music, Best Sound, and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score, and Best Original Song for \"I See You\" by Leona Lewis.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Well, after all the hype - and a chance to see this for free on a Blu-Ray disc - it was an offer I couldn't refuse. In the end, and even though it's a long film (2 hrs, 40 minutes) I watched it all and wasn't surprised at much of anything story-wise. Like a lot of modern-day action films, they start off great but slowly become unraveled and during the last third of movie, you have to totally \"check your brains at the door,\" but this movie, overall, was fun to watch.<br/><br/>For much of it, there were enough visual wonders in here, fantastic colors and special-effects to make up for Director/writer James Cameron's usual Liberal political bias and stereotypical characters. In many respects, you've seen this story before a number of times. In fact, if you've seen \"Dances With Wolves,\" you've seen \"Avatar,\" the main difference being the setting: instead of the Old West you have a futuristic planet. The story is basically the same, the one filmmakers love to present: the evil white military-like corporation men invade the peaceful natives for greed and profit.... and troubles ensue. Throw in the \"mixed\" romance you saw in \"Dances With Wolves\" and you have a good chunk of this story. Very little has changed except for the futuristic eye candy. Instead of the American Indian, we have the \"Na'vi,\" which are portrayed in a very similar light except for the blue skin, of course.<br/><br/>The only creativity in this film is in the special-effects department, but - wow - what creativity! The visuals are the attraction to this movie, pure and simple. The amazing jungle scenery, bizarre bird creatures and illuminating small objects everywhere will dazzle you, especially played through a Blu-Ray disc and big HD set. The transfer is as sharp as any you'll see.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Having heard the hype about how this was the greatest film ever made followed by the counter hype saying it was over-rated derivative rubbish I wasn't sure that I wanted to see it but when an opportunity arose to watch it on DVD I decided it was time to watch it for myself and make my own mind up. Having seen it I can say that I don't think that it was the greatest film ever made and I certainly thought the main story was fairly derivative, it certainly wasn't rubbish though. Even though the story was fairly predictable I found it enjoyable and thought the characters were fairly interesting although the chief bad guy was hammy in such an over the top way he was funny. The real star of the film though was the planet Pandora; the CGI was done so well that it was possible to suspend disbelief and forget that this was a computer generated world.<br/><br/>The message of the film is fairly heavy handed; it is clear from early on that the humans on Pandora are the bad guys who are willing to destroy a pristine world and its native population to acquire a valuable mineral. There were a few surprises to be had though; the humans did far more damage to the natives' world than I'd expected and more than one character I'd expected to survive died. If you are one of the few people who still haven't seen this I'd recommend giving it a go to see what all the fuss was about; it might not be perfect but it is spectacular.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I wasn't going to bother seeing Avatar: I was afraid that it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations as far as the visuals were concerned, and some reports had also been been rather critical of the plot, likening it to 'Dances With Wolves', only with aliens.<br/><br/>But inevitably, all the talk of mind-blowing effects and jaw-dropping 3D was enough to finally reel me in, and I'm pleased to say that, once again, James Cameron has succeeded in delivering the goods—and then some.<br/><br/>Those who have maligned Avatar for its condemnation of war instigated by greed, or given it flak for its tree-hugging sentiments should get a grip: if Cameron wants to use his projects as a forum for his beliefs (and let's face it, he's not exactly alone in his opinions) then he can go ahead—surely what matters is that the film doesn't suffer for it. And Avatar doesn't.<br/><br/>As a piece of 100% slam-bang, in-your-face, holy-cow-how-did-they-do-that, OMG-did-I-really-just-see-that entertainment, it is near perfection: the plot brilliantly combines pure imagination and wonder, incredible white-knuckle action, and genuine pathos; the acting is incredible, with the cast giving superb performances, even when given a massive CGI makeover; and Cameron's use of his advanced, state-of-the-art 3D technology is simply incredible, the design of which draws inspiration from many sources—most notably, perhaps, certain progressive rock album covers from the 70s.<br/><br/>On a purely personal level, I also loved the fact that both Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez were in the film: they're unlikely bits of totty, I know, but Weaver still has a certain something, even at the age of 60, and Rodriguez has made the hot tough-chick routine all her own.<br/><br/>Until someone takes an even mightier leap into the cinematic unknown, developing all the more dazzling techniques to wow an audience (and I'll hazard a guess that that person will be Cameron again), Avatar has set the bar for stunningly beautiful fantasy entertainment.</div>,\n",

The CGI effects were through the roof and amazingly nice to look at.<br/><br/>The story, the plot, the characters? Well, they were taken straight out of a \"how to make a Hollywood action movie\" book. There was nothing here that haven't been seen in a bunch of other movies. Actually, Avatar seems to be a million dollar remake of the \"Battle for Terra\" animated movie. Everything in this movie is cliché and seen countless other times. I am not going to give away spoilers for the movie, but once you sit down and watch it, you will go \"hmmm, I have seen this exact storyline and event somewhere else\"...<br/><br/>Were I to give a rating for the CGI and effects alone, this movie would be a top score, but a movie needs to be more than glamorous effects and fireworks - it needs depth and a solid story. This is where Avatar fell apart.<br/><br/>And you just got to love the way Cameron worked in the climate situation propaganda. That was just hilarious! Overall, the movie takes you in for a thrillride of spectacular colors and effects, and provides mediocre entertainment story- and plotwise.<br/><br/>I was left with a sense of disappointment from this movie. It could have been so much more than a mediocre thrillride.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron has done it again. He surely knows how to make a movie that captures the fancy of viewers of all ages and from all walks of life. While the actual story is good, its only novelty is that it is based on the distant planet Pandora, and visitors must be put into a cryo-cooled state for the long journey, then awakened upon arrival. Other than that it is a standard story of peoples from different backgrounds with an unlikely love story interwoven. Think Pilgrims and Natives, John Smith and Pocohontas, Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>The \"hook\" in this movie is the creation of the hybrid Avatar, which has both Earthling DNA and Pandorian DNA, so the resulting being, grown in large pods that simulate development in a womb, emerges fully grown, and is very tall and blue. But this Avatar can't function on its own, it must be controlled by its Earthling, the one whose DNA was used. The Earthling enters a special compartment, and via special electrodes is able to see through the Avatar's eyes, speak through it, run, fight, and everything else through it. But when the Earthling is disconnected the Avatar falls into a deep sleep and remains that way until the Earthling activates it again. This can be tricky! <br/><br/>So why are they doing all this? One, to study the Pandorian race, whose atmosphere will not support Earthling life without a special breather. So the Avatar solves that problem. But there is also a rare metal, Unobtanium (I chuckled at their choice of that name!), which is desperately needed on Earth, but the richest deposits are in the ground under and around the Tree of Life where the Pandorians have made their main home. The peace-loving scientists want to gain Pandorian cooperation to have them move, but their religious connections make that unlikely. The competing group are military and their motto is, if they won't move peacefully then lest blast them out of there, let's incinerate them.<br/><br/>The main character is a crippled man, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully. His identical twin brother was to control the Avatar Jake, but unfortunately was killed so Jake, having the same DNa, made him a match. But he had missed the special training. His love interest is the Pandorian, Zoe Saldana as Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver is the site scientific leader, Dr. Grace Augustine, and she has her own Avatar.<br/><br/>The militant leader is Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch. And the commercial leader, pushing for something to be done is Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge.<br/><br/>The animation is superb, the motion-capture technology, which was NOT part of the DVD extras, must have been exotic to enable them to make such realistic looking characters. You really forget you are looking at animation. I didn't care for the extreme fighting and military action in the last act, but overall a very good movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: It looked like the militant Earthlings were going to be successful in destroying the Pandorians and their society. But Jake, getting to know them, turned his talents to help the Pandorians who ultimately prevailed. Then, at the end, a way was found where Jake would fully inhabit his Avatar, and the old Earthling Jake would die. he ended up as a Pandorian himself.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron has big ideas and big visions. Thankfully, the latter he dives into with a lust for cinematic glory and (with more money than some countries have in an entire year) he has made his vision of a planet called Pandora in the year 21-something something of a real wonder. If only his big ideas weren't, for the most part, cribbed from other movies and stories and archetypes. I would be reminded of Joseph Campbell's myth-buster formula that so many have taken to heart in adventure movies, but Cameron's formula would appear to come second to his attention to visual detail. This has its pros and cons, some more or some less depending on what viewer sees/hears in it all.<br/><br/>It is ambitious, and quite expensive, and it all shows up on the screen. It has to be said, Avatar is absorbing to look at. So much time and energy was spent into creating this fictional alien species, the Na'vi, and it pays off in the respect that Cameron's visual fx team painstakingly makes it appear real and otherworldly at the same time. We might recognize the lush and green surroundings, or even some of the trippy creatures, and if it comes close to anything it's like Ferngully: The Last Rainforest squared and made semi-pre-historic. But it's the scope and grandeur, and when we see the Na'Vi in close-ups or even just far away, you can see the sweat and the detail in their faces, the human beings playing them projecting off the screen. I forgot, if only for a few moments at a time, that they were animated and done in motion-capture. If part of a filmmaker's job, in a situation like a super-mega-sci-fi epic is to make us believe in another world and place (even if it's familiar), then Cameron has done his job very admirably.<br/><br/>So if Pandora is great to look at (especially in the practically prerequisite 3D, which also has its own levels of detail and nuance and doesn't just JUMP at a viewer), and if the technology shown on screen- of how a human being goes into an avatar, is fascinating, then why isn't it such a smash all around? Simple - the story, and the characters. Cameron does pay them attention, but only inasmuch as to get us going into the Pandora environment. When he has characters like Jake Sully (very good Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana, even better) saying such trite dialog and going through the motions of a story that is familiar to anyone who has seen Ferngully or Dances with Wolves or, to a lessor extent, Last Samurai or New World (super pro-environment, obvious anti-colonialist), it starts to drag the film with it. I never grew tired of the cinematography or the wonderful sights on Pandora, but could I have done without such one-dimensional gritting-of-teeth from Stephen Lang? Absolutely.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if there should be more movies like Avatar. It takes a filmmaker with the ambition and drive, and the super-screw-you-guys clout that James Cameron has with such a project (not to mention the time for it allotted him - not since Kubrick has a filmmaker taken so long between projects), to pull off something like this. CGI-driven movies could progress thanks to the prowess displayed here, but it does need to be done with the right frame of attitude towards the story. Even if such story is formulaic as this one, a filmmaker does need to try and push the technology a little further while also not forgetting about the human element. Cameron comes close... no, he does go over the brink of doing style over substance, but for this case- and maybe just this one time from an otherwise masterful blockbuster director- it's satisfying.</div>,\n",

(I have to admit here that during some of the beginning live action sequences, I fell asleep but I managed to be awake when the first computer animated scene came on and stayed so afterwards.) Sigorney Weaver is certainly compelling as the scientist character and it was a nice to see Michelle Rodriguez, who I last watched on \"Lost\", as a heroic pilot.

Four years of production and AVATAR gives us a whole new generation of cinematic experiences.<br/><br/>This movie takes place on Pandora, a human outpost light years away, where a rare mineral is being collected to help solve part of Earth's energy crisis. The atmosphere of Pandora is toxic, so the government has created an Avatar program that blends human DNA with that of Pandora's indigenous population called...the Navi. The program allows humans to become \"drivers' of their own consciousness that is downloaded to an \"avatar\"...which is actually a hybrid remote-controlled body on Pandora. Jake, a wheelchair bound Marine(Sam Worthington)is given the chance to walk again(as an \"avatar\") as he takes the mission of infiltrating the Navi and convincing them to relocate so the government can mine the sought-after mineral below their communal home. Jake will form a strong relationship with his Navi teacher Neytiri(Zoe Saldana). Jake must make a choice of where his allegiance lies...will he become a traitor? Who's hero will he become? Or will he be a hero at all? Some, I'm sure, will take exception to AVATAR'S finale, which makes no apology to any religious conception.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is an epic science fiction film written and directed by James Cameron, and starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, Joel David Moore, Giovanni Ribisi and Sigourney Weaver. The film is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are mining a precious mineral called unobtanium on Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system.The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi—a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to the genetically engineered Na'vi-human hybrid bodies used by a team of researchers to interact with the natives of Pandora.<br/><br/>The film was shot on the proprietary FUSION digital 3D cameras developed by Cameron in collaboration with Vince Pace, and offers a groundbreaking mix of live-action dramatic performances and computer-generated effects. The revolutionary motion-capture system created for the film allows the facial expressions of actors to be captured as a virtual camera system enables them to see what their computer-generated counterparts will be seeing in the film, and Peter Jackson's Oscar-winning Weta Digital visual-effects house supervises Avatar's complex special effects.<br/><br/>A paraplegic ex-marine finds a new life on the distant planet of Pandora, only to find himself battling humankind alongside the planet's indigenous Na'vi race in this ambitious digital 3D sci-fi epic from Academy Award-winning Titanic director James Cameron. The film, which marks Cameron's first dramatic feature since Titanic, follows Jake Sully, a war veteran who gets called to the depths of space to pick up the job of his slain twin brother for the scientific arm of a megacorporation looking to mine the planet of Pandora for a valued ore. Unfortunately the biggest deposit of the prized substance lies underneath the home of the Na'vi, a ten-foot-tall, blue-skinned native tribe who have been at war with the security arm of the company, lead by Col. Miles Quaritch. Because of the planet's hostile atmosphere, humans have genetically grown half-alien/half-human bodies which they can jack their consciousnesses into and explore the world in. Since Jake's brother already had an incredibly expensive Avatar grown for him, he's able to connect with it using the same DNA code and experience first- hand the joys of Pandora while giving the scientific team, led by Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and Norm Spellman, some well-needed protection against the planet's more hostile forces.On a chance meeting after getting separated from his team, Jake's Avatar is rescued by Neytiri, a Na'vi princess, who brings him into her tribe in order to give the humans a second chance at relating to this new environment. When word gets out of his increasing time with the alien species, Quaritch enlists Jake to do some reconnaissance for the company, as they'd like to persuade the tribe to move their home before taking more drastic measures to harness the treasure hidden below. Yet as Jake becomes one with the tribe and begins to understand the secrets of Pandora, his conscience is torn between his new adopted world and the wheelchair-bound one awaiting him when the psychic connection to his Avatar is broken. Soon battle lines are drawn and Jake needs to decide which side he will fight on when the time comes. <br/><br/>Spiritually moving, visually daring and emotionally stirring, Avatar is classic storytelling at its very best.As a fantasy epic, Avatar is an undeniable victory but outside of the narrow confines of immersion he's managed, it's also quite limited.The narrative would be ho-hum without the spectacle. But what spectacle! Avatar is dizzying, enveloping, vertiginous to that point that I ran out of adjectives an hour into its end credits.It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This comment is on the IMAX 3d version.<br/><br/>There aren't many stories, are there? There are not many good storytellers either. Nor, it turns out, many filmmakers who can make even moderately big movies with a single governing imagination. That is the first quality I will report of this: that a single mind governed the creation and dynamics of this world and how we see it. The second quality is the experience of realism in the artificial faces. Both of those are reported by others well enough.<br/><br/>What really impressed me was how deeply the philosophy of WETA has penetrated grand film-making. They did the world. Now, the world by itself would be remarkable. But Cameron clearly wanted the dimensionality of \"King Kong\" writ large. The thing is dimensional. The camera is placed in positions that no physical camera could; it moves in ways that are distinctly alien in the alien sections of the movie; the sequence of surrounding shots in a scene, particularly an action scene, is more than double what you normally would get and surrounds. The way it surrounds is taken from what WETA did with \"Van Helsing:\" the movements are those you see in the flight movements of the flying dragons. So they are of the movie and in the thing as well.<br/><br/>There is, therefore, a distinctly Australia-New Zealand flavor to this. <br/><br/>That isn't the only nontraditional self-referential bit. Cameron loves these. We have the filmmaker to the film as the same as the otherworld immersion set up and controlled by Weaver's character. And indeed she reports that she modeled her character on Cameron. The bit about the forest as a neuronal net is not entirely unlike what visionaries in the computer graphics world talk about having in the future.<br/><br/>A significantly unsettling element is the weaponry. Somebody boot ILM out of the game. It is really likely that a future that can master space travel and DNA remoting is likely to rely on Viet Nam era things-that-shoot? The only reason they are there is so that for the final battle we can have traditional cinematic shootouts overlain on our by then well established dimensional reality. And gosh, have we had enough already of the enhancer suits? Though I cheered and cried with the crowd, I wish I could have left feeling that love story was unpolluted by the ordinary. <br/><br/>One thing that I will predict. I trace the use of orreries and global machines in films, because it affects the vocabulary we can use in how we grow the cosmologies behind noir. Here we have the trees. One is huge and helical, a home to a population. It is downed like the World Trade towers by a guy out of central casting that in other theaters we are cheering because he is blowing up terrorists. Here he says he is fighting terror preemptively with terror.<br/><br/>The second tree — the tree of souls — is not rendered well visually. But the idea is an amazing advance in film scriptology. It moved me as the guiding principle behind the inevitable love. That it collected the soul of Cameron's avatar was a bit delicious. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">So here it is then, what has been in gestation in James Cameron's mind for over 12 years finally hit the silver screen towards the back end of 2009. Made for gazillions amount of cash, Avatar went on to make a billion trillion in Worldwide receipts-and this before the rush rush release of DVD/BLU RAY sales are factored into the equation. The film, and all its technical wizardry, is quite simply a gargantuan piece of cinematic history. Released in 2d and 3d, and probably some other format that I'm forgetting, every advanced tool of the trade has been utilised by Cameron and his team to create what is now the ultimate popcorn blockbuster. Shame then, that away from the visual extravaganza the film is as shallow as this review will ultimately end up being.<br/><br/>No doubt about it, this is a joy for the eyes and ears, the minuscule details are wonderful and the colour positively pings from every frame. But in the eagerness to create such splendour they forgot to put any substance into the writing. This is plot simplicity. And even its messages, as Cameron smugly preaches his sermon from the pulpit, now seem old hat. Do we really need another boink over the head about eco invasion? Or a curt reminder of American infiltration into some land where motives are suspicious at best? No we don't really do we? Worse still is some of the dialogue, which quite frankly could have come from some playground encounter as the kiddies play kiss chase or bang bang your dead army. There's also a sense of familiarity with other better scripted film's, Dances *cough* With *cough* Wolves *cough* It's as if Cameron just knew that narrative structure wasn't as important as having the expensive gimmicks. He's like a modern day William Castle-only with considerably more readies at his disposal.<br/><br/>The cast are OK, Zoe Saldana puts a sexy feistiness to her blue alien Neytiri, Sam Worthington keeps the humanistic elements just about above water, while Sigourney Weaver is as ever the consummate professional. But ironically, in a film shimmering bright in 2d &amp; 3d, the characters are all one dimensional. None more so than Stephen \"The Party Crasher\" Lang's Colonel. A man so gruff and gung-ho menacing he really ought to be in Sly Stallone's upcoming testo movie The Expendables. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, it won three, for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction. Those were richly deserved. They also tell us all we need to now about Cameron's Behemoth. 5/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I really did not like the way way this movie was advertised \" A film that will change the face of cinema etc etc etc \" . I'm one of those strange creatures who is actually turned off by hyperbolic markerteering . On top of that I'm not someone who's going to sit in a cinema wearing 3D glasses . It's bad enough being a speccy in real life . Who wants to add expensive insult to injury by sitting in a cinema looking like a muppet with shades ? In summary I had no intention of watching AVATAR in a cinema if at all <br/><br/>In April I found myself on a very long plane trip from Heathrow to India and decided that because I'd seen most of what was on offer I decided to watch AVATAR . Being on a plane where the format is cropped and missing the 3D visuals means that you're able to concentrate on the story . The truth is that the plot is absolutely threadbare and is padded out with long sequences that might seduce an audience in to watching the visuals but plot wise there's nothing happening at all<br/><br/>Fault number one - there's very little happening to the plot for large chunks of the movie . Fault number two is that character wise everything is black and white . Good guys ( Read humans ) are blacker than the darkest night while good guys ( Read blue skinned aliens ) are so white they're brighter than the sun itself. It's almost like watching a simplistic revisionary Western where the Indians are the goodies and the calvary are the baddies . I say \" almost \" because Hollywood has never come up with a Western like that and never will . There is no complexity involved what so ever . The bad guys are bad guys and the good guys are good guys and there's no motives involved . Some people may complain that LORD OF THE RINGS also suffered from this characterization but at least the LOTR wasn't a 3D gimmick and had saving graces . Take away the 3D and you'll find AVATAR has no other function as a marketing tool . Also nice to know it was stuffed at the Oscars by the cheap and compelling tiny budget THE HURT LOCKER</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic Marine who travels to the world of Pandora to do what he thinks is protecting the Earth. The natives of that world are said to be vicious and cruel. By transforming into one of them in his sleep (or something) he realizes they are NOT the evil ones and he begins to have serious doubts about his mission. This leads to an all out battle at the end.<br/><br/>Basically this is cowboys vs. Indians in outer space. This is VERY easy to follow and understand which is the main problem. Everything here is totally and utterly predictable! You've seen these characters and situations all before. I was always one or two steps ahead on the plot and this isn't good for a movie that runs a needless 165 minutes. This could have easily been wrapped up in 90 minutes. Some people find getting into the world of the aliens is fascinating. I wasn't fascinated at all--just thoroughly and utterly bored! To make matters worse the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book and the characters are either evil or good--no shades of grey or ambiguity. The movie also preaches it's against war but \"entertains\" us with an all out battle at the end. Lots of people agree that the plot is light but the incredible special effects make up for it. Not for me! Yeah the special effects are impressive (especially in 3-D) but that isn't enough for such a long movie with a dull storyline. I can't really comment on the acting here considering no one is given a character to play--they're all walking, talking clichés. Only two people stand out--Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver. Worthington is very handsome with beautiful eyes and a cute little Australian accent. Weaver is strong and commanding playing a scientist.<br/><br/>I will admit the battle at the end was (kind of) fun but I was mostly bored silly throughout this. I kept looking at my watch patiently waiting for this to end. I have to admit I'm in the minority here. It's gotten rave reviews from critics and has already broken box office records. I attended a 4:30 show on a Saturday afternoon--and it was sold out! It's also among the top 50 movies here on IMDb. I guess a lot of people like predictable stories with non-stop special effects and cardboard characters. I need something more than that. The 2 is only for the effects and hot Worthington.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Lord I miss the Last Air bender....<br/><br/>James Cameron's half a BILLION dollar film (figure in the promotion its around that figure) is a huge animated film masquerading as a live action feature film. Its, like most of Cameron's super productions, a self serving over hyped monstrosity that is neither as good as he thinks it is or as bad as we hoped it would be.<br/><br/>Billed as the next step in entertainment I'm left wondering what makes the film different then anything thats gone before other than the motion capture characters. The Next step? only if you go to the movie on rare occasions and never read fantasy or Science Fiction. Ursula Le Guin, Piers Anthony, EE Doc Smith and everyone else working in genre has been there before. Is it really worth the effort to count down the long list of films this borrows from Quigley Down Under to A Man Called Horse to the Matrix to Aliens to Dances with Wolves to anything I've read people have compared it to. Its a plot as well worn as they come. Even the music is lifted from tribal chants to Star Trek The Motion Picture to anything with soaring choral music. Its's also clear Wayne Barlowe designed the look of the creatures since they seem similar to numerous creatures he's painted over the years.(Had they wanted to be radical they would have had Barlowe go off the board) Okay I could go on ripping the film to shreds but lets try and take it on its own terms.<br/><br/>Lets say it, the film is neither original nor ground breaking. Its an over hyped film that is much too in love itself. It is painfully overlong at seventeen...er almost three hours.<br/><br/>The plot has a cripple ex-marine taking his twin brothers place as an avatar pilot on a distant world. He is assigned to infiltrate the locals and find out as much as he can. he does so and in the process falls in love with the people and one girl in particular. He then has to fight with his new people to save them and their way of life.<br/><br/>On the most basic of levels the plot is fine but on a detailed level there are lots of plot holes and plot questions. Thankfully Cameron in his wonderful junior high school way has set up outs for many things that don't make sense like how will the good guys win when they have bows and arrows and the humans have explosives and bullets.( Cameron is not a stupid man as anyone who has heard him talk or seen his documentaries can attest, however his story construction has always been stunted and simplistic at best) How the simplicity will survive in two planned sequels is beyond me.<br/><br/>There are lots of long \"look isn't this great\" sequences which are meant to show off. On the plus side they look good in 2D on the down side the film slows way down as a result.<br/><br/>The performances are fine but out side of the main two characters everyone is cardboard. Its fine because they aren't given much to really do but at the same time they all blur together.<br/><br/>The action scenes are good but not great with many of the oh cool sequences in the TV commercials. Also some sequences seem stretched out for no good reason with lots of slow motion to make everything look \"Cool\".<br/><br/>In all honesty had this film lost an hour it would have been a much better film, but at two hours forty something minutes this film is a soul killer. My Dad and I just looked at each other at about the half way point an wondered how much longer this had to go and we both groaned when we realized it was almost it was eighty something minutes.<br/><br/>Its not a bad film. Its worth seeing, but I don't know that I needed to see it on a big screen, and while I didn't see it in 3D I don't think I really would have liked it more if I had. Personally I think you can wait for DVD or cable.<br/><br/>(A friend of a a friend who didn't like the film said that he now understands how people who don't get Star Wars feel. Frankly there is a difference. Love of Star Wars comes from a real place, a place that wasn't mass media created. All of the hype to Avatar is PR created hype put together to sell tickets. Star Wars is a film that is about characters moving in a simplistic story where things just are, the worlds of Luke Skywalker were not pushed in our faces until the marketing machines took over with Return of the Jedi and by that time the characters and the story had taken hold because they were good. Avatar is a simple story pumped up to sell tickets and sell toys.Its had the marketing machine from the first moment.. Star Wars has been out for almost 33 years, spawned 6 films, numerous novels, comics and TV shows. Avatar has been out a week and has spawned little more than some mixed box office and a budget debt bigger than many countries GNP. I'll wait 33 Years before I assess how successful Avatar is.) 6 out of 10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The highly touted and long anticipated \"Avatar\" (*** out of ****) from writer &amp; director James Cameron of \"Titanic\" fame qualifies as a predictable but entertaining sci-fi culture clash between the aggressive, technology-driven human race and a primitive, agrarian-fueled alien society. Mankind has shipped in mind-boggling machinery to plunder the planet of a mineral called Unobtanium worth an astronomical fortune. The complication is an entire race of Smurf-colored, Zulu-tall, humanoid aliens called the Na'vi worships a gigantic tree rooted in the same soil as the priceless minerals.<br/><br/>Basically, \"Avatar\" pits tree-huggers against tree-haters. Indeed, the story is as venerable as any cavalry western about the white hero who joins a clueless Indian tribe living atop a hopelessly rich gold strike. Although he acts as a go-between, the hero betrays his own kind and sides with the Indians to preserve the land rather than let his own people rape it. Unfortunately, Cameron generates minimal emotion from this \"Dances with Wolves\" melodrama. More problematic from the standpoint of credibility is the hybrid storyline. \"Avatar\" alternates, albeit it smoothly, between a feature-length cartoon like \"FernGully: The Last Rainforest\" and a Big Dumb \"Matrix\" Action Movie stocked with stereotypes. Historically, \"Avatar\" pays tribute to the legendary Pocahontas and Captain John Smith romance.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" takes place in the year 2145, on the distant planet of Pandora, after mankind has depleted all its natural resources on Earth. No, this has nothing to do with the terrible sci-fi thriller \"Pandorum\" that starred Dennis Quaid. \"Avatar\" and \"Pandorum\" are two entirely separate sci-fi sagas. After his intellectually-gifted twin-brother is shot and killed by a mugger, Jack Scully--who is paralyzed from the waist down--is selected to replace him for a top-secret mission. A former Marine, Jake (Sam Worthington of \"Terminator: Salvation\") is shipped off to distant Pandora to resolve tensions with the native Na'vi people so his fellow earthlings can excavate the Unobtanium. Jake sprawls out in a cylindral chamber and projects his consciousness into his flesh &amp; blood avatar to control it. The avatar is a genetically bred replica of Pandora's indigenous Na'vi tribe. This avatar includes both human and Na'vi genetic material. Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang of \"Tombstone\") commands the Earth project to extract the Unobtanium and he amounts to a one-dimensional \"Rambo\" villain. Meaning, he won't be easy to kill. Stephen Lang makes a terrific villain who wants to see this peaceful but noble people destroyed. <br/><br/>Colonel Quaritch considers biologist Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver of \"Aliens\") a complete nuisance, but corporate representative Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi of \"The Mod Squad\") lets Grace perform her diplomatic initiative to gain the trust and cooperation of the Na'vi. Secretly, Quaritch has cut a deal with Jake. If Jake can deliver the intelligence about the Na'vi that Quaritch needs, then he will have the medical gurus restore the use of Jake's legs. Meanwhile, Grace treats Jake with nothing but contempt. She refers to him as a \"Jarhead dropout.\" Jake is separated from Grace and company during a helicopter ride into the jungle and he has to fend for himself in the wild. Neytiri nearly kills Jake when she encounters him first, but something happens that she has rarely seen in nature and she spares Jake his life.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the wise head of the Na'vi clan, Neytiri's father (Wesley Studi of \"Last of the Mohicans\") orders her to train Jake, in his avatar form about their ways so they can better study him. Naturally, Jake falls in love with a maiden warrior princess Neytiri (Zoe Saldana of \"Star Trek\") and she introduces Jake to the jungle and its dangers. Neytiri seems more like an Environmentalist version of \"Mulan\" and she is no slouch when she has to shoot arrows. Inevitably, as the conventions dictate, the heroine falls for the hero and they become inseparable. Along the way, Jake learns how to use his tail to ride a giant sky lizard and later an even bigger sky lizard.<br/><br/>According to Hindu mythology, an avatar is a deity who takes human form and descended to earth. An avatar in computer parlance is an icon that a person adopts for use in virtual reality or cyberspace. In \"Avatar,\" the avatar is a prefabricated body controlled by brain waves emitted by a human who functions as the body's driver. Cameron spends most of the first half-hour shoving exposition down our throats because he has to bring us up to speed on a brave new universe and its colorful but mysterious people. Of course, the special effects are awesome, but you need not see \"Avatar\" in 3-D because it refrains from exploiting the technology the way most 3-D movies do. In other words, rarely does anything come flying out at you. The planet of Pandora with its floating mountains and luminous fauna is a treat for the eye. Pandora looks like an underwater planet without water, and the beasts that lurk in its lush jungle vaguely resemble our prehistoric dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, despite its imposing 160-minute running time, Cameron maintains sufficient momentum to see things through to the kick-butt finale between good and evil. Some of the technology the avaricious earthlings import to the Pandora may remind you of the second \"Alien\" movie, \"Aliens,\" which was helmed by Cameron. Of course, \"Gamer\" and \"Surrogates\" beat Cameron to the punch with their stories about an avatar-oriented society. The visual spectacle and splendor of \"Avatar\" with its floating mountains and its \"Black Hawk Down\" aerial sequences will hold your attention. Again, the Zulu Smurfs with Submariner ears and \"Lion King\" snouts never conjure up a tenth of the emotional charisma of a live-action character. In this respect, Cameron has embraced the performance capture technology espoused by Robert Zemeckis in his last three films. In other words, the sentiment is not sticky enough because they lack depth as characters.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"I was saved! I was saved by a flying wild man in a loincloth.\" No, that is not Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) talking about Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), but Jane speaking about Tarzan, the original \"white savior.\" Avatar is just another version of the \"white savior\" movie - the natives are incapable of protecting themselves, so a white savior learns their language and customs and protects them from the invaders; in this case the military-industrial complex of a certain country that invades others (like Iraq) so they can get their resources (unobtainium or oil).<br/><br/>The one thing James Cameron did was pack his film with lots of good and great actors (Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang), and amazing special effects. No matter what the story, it is definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>Now, that is not to say it is perfect by any means. The Pocahontas story was really tiresome, and designed to appeal to the teens. The fan boys were captured by the bare breasted natives. Why is it that only natives can go bare breasted? Personally, Michelle Rodriguez in a t shirt was way hotter than the natives.<br/><br/>Needless to say the military and their Star Wars weapons of war are no match for Mother Nature.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">3D graphics, 1D story. Great special effects, but that is about it. The story is basic, cheesy and predictable, like it was meant for kids (and it probably was). The greeny/anti-capitalism/anti-imperialism themes are laid on so thick you can't help but support the \"bad\" guys.<br/><br/>Characters are hardly developed at all, so you have very little empathy for them. <br/><br/>And to top it all off, the movie goes on for 160 minutes! Once the novelty of the great CGI has worn off, it quickly starts to drift and gets boring. James Cameron could have left it at about 100 minutes, and not missed anything. There are several scenes that add nothing to the movie, except for Cameron to gratuitously show off his CGI prowess, again. <br/><br/>Surely one of the most over-rated movies of all time.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Let me say that I was most definitely not disappointed by this movie. All of the visuals were just as spectacular and revolutionary as promised and you'll definitely get blown away by it all. It's simply good quality entertainment to watch and great to see that James Cameron, after an absence of 12 years, is back at his game. Nevertheless I still can't rate this movie very highly, since the movie is still a quite flawed one.<br/><br/>The real biggest complaint about this movie is its story. And I don't even mean that it's not being original enough and borrows heavily from well known stories and other movies, including some of Cameron's own. It's more that the story is being so incredibly formulaic and predictable. You can blame this movie for not featuring enough surprises in it. The movie is predictable from start till finish and you can exactly tell what's going to happen next and often how as well. Things also don't exactly get spiced up by some well written dialog, despite the fact that the movie truly had some great actors in it.<br/><br/>Of course it the story does not matter that much though for a movie such as \"Avatar\". This was always going to be a movie that was all about its visuals. And let me tell you, no matter how many great things you heard and read about this movie its visuals, it in no way does justice to what you'll actually get to see in this movie. It's really amazing. It's hard to praise this movie for just a few things, though it probably are the motion capture techniques used for this movie that are going to influence most of the future movies, especially when it comes down to its facial expressions. For lets say 60% of the time you're watching computer generated stuff but it all looks so incredibly good and complex that you really forget all of this and simply get drawn into the world of Pandora. And for the scenes that are not entirely computer generated you also have a whole bunch of other effects, floating somewhere in the background.<br/><br/>Every director wants his 'Star Wars'. To create a world and universe on their own, with many different characters, species and far off worlds. With \"Avatar\" James Cameron made his 'Star Wars' and undoubtedly we'll get some sequels to this movie in the near future, also not in the least due to the movie its insane financial success. Cameron truly created a entire world on his own, that has such an incredible look to it and is filled with many details. All kinds of different plants, species and natural environments pop up out of the computer, which combined with its characters could had provided more than enough material and potential to fill at least 3 more 3 hour long movies with and I hope they will. In this movie everybody and everything still needed to get introduced, while in the sequels they of course can basically start right off with the action, so to speak, since everybody is already familiar with this new world.<br/><br/>It's a long movie, that of course is not without its slower moments. Especially because the movie is progressing so formulaic you want the movie to get to its point and cut to the chase just a bit snappier. But even so it are mostly the visuals and the more than capable actors that still keep the movie going and interesting to watch at all time. But it isn't until its action kicks in that the movie truly becomes spectacular and entertaining. It left me wanting more and was some great adrenaline pumping stuff to watch. Cameron always had been at his best when handling action.<br/><br/>A movie that is not without its flaws but still an incredible revolutionary must-see.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie was all the rage back in '09. I didn't see it then though the world was trying to make me feel as though I missed something. Kinda like they're doing now with \"Squid Game.\" I have finally watched the great \"Avatar\" and this movie is trash. It's not simply an OK movie, this movie is hot, stinking garbage.<br/><br/>The movie takes place entirely on the planet Pandora where a company is mining for a precious metal called \"unobtanium.\" Apparently, in this misanthropic fluff us human beings destroyed our own planet and we've sent a group of paid ex-marines to go destroy another. The only thing standing between Earthlings (Americans) and their unobtanium is a race of aliens called Na'vi. They will try to barter and bargain with the Native American looking aliens, but if that doesn't work then it's all out annihilation to get what they want.<br/><br/>In this movie that draws extreme analogies we have the aliens as your Native Americans replete with little clothing, a foreign language (that is still human-like), and a oneness with nature, and the company as your colonizing white men willing to take what's not theirs by force if necessary. The company has employed a couple of scientists in order to humanely take the resources they want. The scientists' job is to make nice with the Alien Indians in order to persuade them to \"share\" their unobtanium. The company also hired our hero, ex-marine and paraplegic, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) to be an armed escort for the scientists as well as a spy to gather intel on the aliens.<br/><br/>Jake and the scientists do a Matrix thing where they get into a chamber and have their consciousness beamed into the body of synthetically grown Na'vi aliens. Our hero was a hot headed marine to start, but you knew he'd be tamed by the end. He nearly got himself killed by a vicious local predator and he was within the bow and arrow sights of Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) a female Na'vi who could be considered attractive by anthropomorphic standards. I knew things were going to go a little awry and the way of Hollywood nonsense when Jake was spared by Neytiri. Her reason for sparing him? A sacred white wispy flower from a tree came near her which was a sign. Later, Jake was clothed in little white wisps from the tree of knowledge which meant he was special. Surely, it couldn't have meant anything else like, \"I'm marking this guy because he's dangerous.\"<br/><br/>Things began to take a turn for the worse when the clan elder of this tribe of Na'vi told Jake he had three months to learn their ways at which point they'd either initiate him as one of their own or expel him. At that point I was audibly asking, \"Why!?\" You do realize he is a human who is transferring his consciousness into a synthetic Na'vi body right? The movie made the Na'vi look beyond foolish because the tree which they relied upon for answers had chosen a man who intended to do them harm. Didn't their sacred tree have more insight? In James Cameron's attempt to make the Na'vi look sage and wise he did the complete opposite.<br/><br/>My questions went unanswered and the naive Na'vi fully accepted Jake as one of their own. In three short months Jake learned the language, learned their ways, learned how to merge with his riding beasts, and wooed the finest of the Na'vi. He did in three months what real Na'vi took a lifetime to learn. If, by now, there was any doubt where this movie was going, it was all erased when Jake was given his initiation ceremony and mated with Neytiri.<br/><br/>It wasn't long after Jake mated with Neytiri that the hyperbolic rooh-hah marine caricatures came to forcefully uproot the alien tribe. It was after the initial attack that Jake Sully did the cliche reveal that \"he was sent there for malicious reasons, but now he's in love.\" Of course, like your typical rom-com, Neytiri was upset and wanted nothing to do with the man who betrayed her. The only thing we were missing by that time was rain and sad music.<br/><br/>Jake was forcefully awoken from his synchronizing chamber and locked up for his treasonous act of aiding the Na'vi against the company. I don't know if he was locked up for hours or days, but he wasn't inside his avatar, that's for sure. So what happens during that time? For months he had to regularly leave his avatar to sleep, eat, use the bathroom, and other things, so what of his avatar during that time? Was it left dormant and unmolested? Dead to the world, yet protected from predators, vermin, the weather, and other things that could negatively affect an organic body at rest in the open. When he was broken out of his cell and reunited with his avatar it was comatose on the forest floor where everything around him was burned to a crisp. Was his avatar immune to all that?<br/><br/>At any rate, when he reunited with his avatar he had to think of a way to win back the tribe's trust so that he could lead them in battle. To do that Sully conquered the scariest of flying beasts which helped him win back the hearts of the alien tribe. This was foreshadowed earlier and at that time I was hoping they weren't setting us up for this newly minted Na'vi to do what only five before him had done in the history of their race. Why I was hoping for something different from Hollywood was simply dumb on my part.<br/><br/>From there he united all of the Na'vi tribes, led them to victory in battle, and became a full fledged Na'vi. He was the Rachel Dolezal of Pandora.<br/><br/>This was one of the most patently offensive movies I've ever watched. Spare me the \"save the rainforest\" narrative because that barely factored into the movie. What needs to be understood and recognized if nothing else is that this is a story of a white savior. For years Hollywood has told all people of color that they need a white (male preferably) savior to lead them to glory. Whether it's in the classroom, or in the courtroom, on the sports field, or on the battlefield--a white savior is a must, even if he goes so far as to change his species to make it happen and I'm sick of it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I have watched this both, uh, \"regular\" and in 3D. For anyone wondering, yes, the latter is worth it. This is the first time Cameron has a go at adventure, and me not particularly being a fan of the genre, I went to this because of him. I've yet to see him make a bad picture, and I've seen every fictional feature he's done, save for Titanic(yes, I know, I know, I will get to it) and Piranha II(which doesn't really count, seriously, just read the Trivia for it). They're not all perfect, but they're always good, engaging, well-made, entertaining, and funny. And that is the case here, as well. At two hours and 42 minutes or so, there is not a dull second to be found here. In fact, the pacing is nearly too fast, and, as has been pointed out, for as much character development as there is, a tad more(particularly for the villains; on a related note, Lang is bad-ass) would have been great. This is immensely exciting, and every single frame is involving. The humor is marvelous, fairly little of it falls flat or tries too hard, and Weaver is absolutely hilarious without being irritating. Everyone is well-cast, and the acting performances are flawless, with few exceptions. Worthington gets a proper chance to prove that he has talent, and he hits it out of the park. Ribisi is completely wasted in a one-dimensional role, and he does the best with what he's given to work with. He's asked to portray a jerk, and that he does. Really, really well. This is rather epic in scope, and it never loses the audience. For as much as there is to absorb in this, it is not excessive. The design is gorgeous, and this forest-world is astonishing to behold. It truly comes alive. At no point are the astonishing FX merely to appease viewers wanting to look at something purdy and turn off their brain, it all really affects us, and we feel as though we are running and flying right there with them. Is this revolutionary? Only as far as visual effects go. Others have already pointed it out; this is a lot like Dances with Wolves. And yes, in other ways, this is not the most original piece. Do those aspects make it a poor film? By no means. It is a fantastic message, and I don't see a problem with putting it back in theaters, presented in a package which is a true feast for the eyes, even if it hasn't been twenty years. There is some moderate language, plenty of intensity and a lot of mild violence. Almost everyone can get into this, the only age limit I'd put on it is no pre-teens, as it might be beyond what they can handle. I recommend this to everyone who is at least around 13, or mature for their age. If this turns out to be entirely different from your expectations, I have to ask... is this the first of Jim's movies you catch? 10/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">AVATAR (2009) **** Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, Giovanni Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez, Laz Alonso, Wes Studi, CCH Pounder, Dileep Rao. Filmmaker James Cameron's truly phenomenal – ten years in the making – digital effects sci-fi extravaganza is one of the most tremendous feats in groundbreaking visuals and an instant sci-fi classic: set several hundred years in the future the Earth is relying on distant planet Pandora for a natural resource to provide energy and the only thing getting in the way is its populace – the Na'Vis – ten-foot tall, blue-skinned natives with feline features and a not-so-subtle mirror reflection to the Native Americans' plights : endangered species. While Cameron's script is a bit tin-eared for dialogue (and the parallels of \"Dances With Wolves\")he makes up for in oodles of marvelous, awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping scenes on the big screen with a virtual world on-to-itself and gung-ho paralyzed Marine Jake Scully (Worthington) sent in to infiltrate and assume the identity – hence the title- to learn more about its people (and more importantly gain their trust for the good ol' USA). The use of state-of-the-art motion capture suits worn by the actors allows the CGI to practically absorb their acting DNA onto their counterparts with amazing élan (Saldana truly is the stand-out with her emotional wrought turn as the Na'Vi princess/love interest Neytiri). Best to view in IMAX 3-D with eye-popping wonderment; the #1 box office champ of all time and guaranteed to take home an armful of f/x Oscars. One of the year's very best.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This is not the worst movie ever made, but it's not something that will change the direction of cinema either, and it's definitely not something I would want to sit through a second time. Like Cameron's Titanic it will largely be forgotten in ten years to the point that people in the future will just not believe all of the hype that went on at the time it was in theaters.<br/><br/>Cameron is brilliant with special effects and technology, but he's a good businessman with a sense of showmanship too, and thus he realizes that if he simply made a documentary entitled \"How I Did It\" and showed off and explained how he produced some of his pioneering technological tricks, that nobody but a few dozen geeks such as myself would buy a ticket to see it.<br/><br/>Thus a narrative is added - usually an obvious and emotionally manipulative one - to draw in the largest audience. That was what was done in Titanic, and that is the case here. I can't say that Cameron plagiarized the story either, because he's also a master at taking known story lines and putting them through a blender where you can at no point say this is a retread of any one story. However, it is retread of several well known ones. I won't tell you which stories or else I might give the plot away to the few people left on this planet who haven't seen Avatar and still intend to do so.<br/><br/>My recommendation - see it or don't see it. This one won't change your life.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It's been a long time since I've found myself so utterly immersed in the fictional world created by a film as I was in the one brought to life in James Cameron's astounding \"Avatar.\" His new film does what \"Star Wars\" did way back in 1977: it translates in visual terms the detailed imaginings existing solely in the head of a geek filmmaker. While watching \"Avatar,\" I forgot that any other world, including the one I live in, existed.<br/><br/>And the 3D gimmick is only partially responsible for that. I'd like to see the film again without the distraction of 3D, because I think it would hold up just as well. James Cameron is unpardonably clunky when it comes to narrative storytelling, but as a director of action and movement, practically no one can touch him when he's at the top of his game, and you don't need 3D to appreciate that.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" has the less welcome Cameron trademarks, the ones that ran amuk in \"Titanic\" and killed the non-action portion of that film. He yields his writer's pen like a sledgehammer, and you'd have to be a moron to miss the points he makes in this film about environmentalism, cultural understanding and the global community. And don't even get me started on his villains, in this film portrayed as corporate and military goons in the kinds of gross caricatures Stanley Kubrick lampooned back in his \"Dr. Stragelove\" days. But the vast majority of the film is told in the language of images rather than words, and it's easy to overlook the film's flaws and be instead transported by its beauty.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington, Zoe Caldana and Sigourney Weaver ground the film with terrific performances, and I've never seen motion capture effects work better than they do here. It was frequently hard to remember that we were looking at partially computer generated images and not actors in body makeup.<br/><br/>This is one movie that for once is deserving of its hype.<br/><br/>Grade: A</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">After I saw Terminator 2 at the cinema when it first came out, I had to recover for a day or two. When I started getting my thoughts in order, I realised two things: one, the film had state-of-the-art special effects running all the way through it and, two, those effects were always in service of the story, and never the other way round.<br/><br/>Some consideration of Cameron's filmography makes it clear that, while he is a director who is keen to push the envelope - The Abyss and Titanic also come to mind as movies where effects are pushed into new areas (and I include physical effects as well as photographic and CGI), there is always a strong human heart beating in the film, and you never find yourself thinking that here is a filmmaker who has discovered the bundle of tricks which is CGI, now what can I hang them on? (koff koff Roland Emmerich anyone?) So I watched Avatar on two levels - what it looked like, and what it felt like. As it happens, that's not a bad basis on which to review it, notwithstanding that the essence of successful film-making is that the two should be inextricably tied together.<br/><br/>So what does it look like? I'm a sucker for eye candy, and the answer has to be \"Absolutely stunning.\" Breaking the visuals down into sections: The human locations and hardware are very reminiscent of those in Aliens, and the powered exoskeletons (viz Ripley's fight with the Alien queen in Aliens) make a reappearance, big time; The Pandora vistas are both sufficiently earth-like to enable you to identify, and sufficiently other-worldly to place you on another planet; The Pandora flora and fauna are spectacular, and brilliantly well thought out. I particularly loved an element which hasn't been shown in the trailers, involving the plaits which the Na'vi wear.<br/><br/>Do you believe in what is shown to you? Well, for the first few moments you marvel at the eye candy, and then, yes, you accept what you're seeing. In particular, the Na'vi are real people within a few minutes of meeting them. I was disconcerted to find myself quite fancying an 8 foot tall skinny blue woman with cat's eyes.<br/><br/>The 3D is also amazingly effective in immersing you in both the gritty human locations and also the alien world of Pandora - do try to see it in 3D if you can.<br/><br/>But what of the story? Let's be honest, you're likely to have encountered this tale before. Technology-heavy invaders are determined to acquire a natural resource: unfortunately, this resource lies under a particularly sacred site belonging to an indigenous tribe (think Amazonian rain forest, think buffalo herds), so someone is sent to infiltrate but ends up seeing the beauty of the life pursued by the underdogs, and changes allegiance. Factor in a romance between the infiltrator and the chieftain's daughter who is delegated to train him, and you have a formula story which is likely to be quite familiar.<br/><br/>But it's unfair to level that as a criticism. The reason it's a familiar story is that it's a good story. Filled with tension and audience sympathy for the underdog, it works as well here as it has worked in previous incarnations, and the science fiction trimmings add complications and additional story elements. You do genuinely care for the plight of the Na'vi, and you want the romance between Marine Jake Sully and his Na'vi princess to turn out well.<br/><br/>I must say that Cameron's films generally - and Avatar is no exception - are not films which are going to rank as great cinematic statements. What they are, without exception, is fantastic big screen entertainment - they engage, transport, and carry you along. They are rattling good yarns, delivered by a master storyteller. And, again, Avatar is no exception.<br/><br/>Cameron said that he wanted to make a film where you wouldn't be able to tell where real life ended and CGI began - he has achieved that. And he also said that he was aiming to create CGI faces which the audience could accept as real faces, and which didn't have the deadness behind the eyes which we have seen as recently as Zemeckis' A Christmas Carol. I think he has achieved that, too. If nothing else, this is another of Cameron's films which will stand as a milestone of technical achievement, but it is also a hugely entertaining movie, and one where the story comes first.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Greetings again from the darkness. Any lover of movies has been anxiously awaiting this \"next film\" from James Cameron. If you have lost track of time, it's actually been 12 years since Cameron's \"Titanic\" became the ultimate mega-box office champion. Finally, people can stop asking him what he's been up to! <br/><br/>This is a very difficult movie to review or critique, so here is how I will describe it: it is a Film spectacle ... I mean that in a good way. \"Avatar\" is an event similar to \"Star Wars\" or even \"The Exorcist\". Much anticipation for seeing something we had never before seen on screen! And make no mistake, there are MANY things in this one we have never before seen. You will not find the list here because I believe this one should be viewed with as little upfront knowledge as possible.<br/><br/>The star of the film is not the actors, and certainly not the script, but rather the technology and special effects. Be sure to see it in 3-D, the way Mr. Cameron meant for it to be seen. Some segments are breathtaking in beauty and creativity and splashes of color. I was fascinated by Pandora, the planet where most of the action takes place. The plant life, creatures and inhabitants are truly a new world from the mind of Cameron and crew. Wow.<br/><br/>On the downside, the story is ho-hum at best and downright cheesy in more than a few scenes. Fans will easily pick out the influence of \"Aliens\", \"The Abyss\", the \"Terminator\" series ... heck, even the song over the credits reminds of Celine Dion's claim to fame. Another negative is Sigourney Weaver's completely over the top and unbelievable scientist, and Giovanni Ribisi's mugging corporate puppet. Who would have even imagined the usual laconic Mr. Ribisi was capable of overacting? Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana are actually very good as the leads. Especially Ms. Saldana, who emotes a wide range of emotions despite heavy make-up (an understatement), and is really the best non-technical thing about the film.<br/><br/>In a year of terrific, accessible sci-fi (Moon, Star Trek, Avatar), this one comes up short on story, but makes up for it with awe-inspiring imagery and visuals and sound.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar (2009): Dir: James Cameron / Cast: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez: Here is a film for the ages. It is a visually striking science fiction masterpiece about the uniting of lifestyles. Jake Scully is an injured ex-marine who is transformed into an Avatar. This process involves his mind in an alien body. His mission is to travel to Pandora and drive out the alien lifeforms but he ends up adapting and falling in love both. Director James Cameron creates a tremendous world of creatures and vegetation that ranks it as his greatest achievement. That is quite the accomplishment considering that his resume consists of such films as Titanic and The Terminator. Sam Worthington plays Scully who questions his mission especially when his targets seem peaceful. Zoe Saldana plays the skillful Neytiri who struggles to preserve life and nature but is thrust into forbidden romance and a fight for survival. Sigourney Weaver plays one of Scully's contacts who decides to experience the lifestyle with him despite the consequences that arise. Stephen Lang plays a ruthless Colonel who pushes ahead with plans of destruction that forces Scully to wage war against him. Michelle Rodriguez plays a fighter pilot in a role that seems tailor made for her and she excels at. Fantastic eye candy masterpiece about preserving culture. Score: 10 / 10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron returned to the directors chair after a 12-year hiatus to helm this enormous blockbuster that became the highest-grossing film of all time! Story concerns a paralyzed marine named Jake Sully(played by Sam Worthington), who is used as an avatar(where a person's mind can inhabit another body, in this case ten-foot tall, blue-skinned aliens on the planet Pandora) in order to learn more about their culture so that they can be persuaded to leave their homes, since they sit atop an extremely valuable mineral rock that is worth a fortune. Trouble is, Jake becomes so immersed in his new identity that he doesn't want to go back to his old one, leading to a ruthless final battle between the Pandorans and the invading Earth forces led by a callous Col.(played by Stephen Lang).<br/><br/>A visual feast, Cameron fills the screen with astonishing CGI marvels that will dazzle the viewer and immerse them in this unique cinematic world. True, the story isn't original(\"Dances With Wolves\" did do it better.) but it is an interesting inversion of expectations, since the Earth people are clearly the callous invaders, and the local population the good guys! Long but most interesting film is still a success, and it seems sequels are on the way...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is just okay but not that great with both good and bad points. Why do so many people keep praising this movie so unreservedly? I don't want to watch it again for sure.<br/><br/>The storyline is weak. Not that much really happens and there aren't any surprises. There is a little excitement at the end but it just doesn't have the genuine thrill and likable characters of Terminator or the romance and sweep of Titanic. The environmental / anti war message is noble but too rammed down your throat. The dialog lacked humor or wit.<br/><br/>The characters are unsympathetic. The blue creatures are mostly ugly and mildly annoying especially Zoe Saldana's high pitched squeals and strange movements. You don't really feel for any of the humans either.<br/><br/>The much lauded effects are beautiful at first but after about 20 minutes its just the same thing and the same colors over and over again. Quite monotonous. I watched the 3d version and I had a headache for hours after. Its actually quite hard to see whats going on with the blurry backgrounds. Make sure you see it in a bigger 3d screen because I saw it in a smallish one and that could have made things worse.<br/><br/>Casting is alright though Sam Worthington is a bit stony. Sigourney is a welcome presence.<br/><br/>In the end it not an Oscar or golden globe worthy movie. Just a nomination will do. Just because Cameron takes a long time over a movie doesn't make it a great one. Of course it is still worth seeing. Just don't expect that much.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">We All know that Cameron is a genius. The man ha made some consistently fantastic films since 1984. 12 years after the behemoth which was 'Titanic', he gives us Avatar.<br/><br/>It's mixed bag unfortunately, and it's as if Cameron has borrowed from some of his other movies just to get a head start in the story arc.<br/><br/>The obvious movies he has borrowed from are the Abyss and Aliens, with their discovering life/war connotation respectively, and Cameron keeps with the protection of the loved one/parental instinct issues he has used in his movies since 'The Terminator, which is all good stuff, but after all the hype and the trailer, the film is decidedly more 'okay' than awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>the effects may be the best i have seen on screen, and the 3-D really adds a whole new life to the movie. Cameron knows how to make a spectacle, and the last 45 minutes of the movie are probably the most amazing thing you will see on the big screen for a while (and i mean big screen, there are a lot of films with better endings, but for pure spectacle, you have to hand it to Cameron).<br/><br/>the cast are good, Worthington again proves that he could be the next big thing for a while, and the rest of the crew are solid. but the poor film suffers from the hype button being pressed too hard for too long.<br/><br/>i was expecting something that not only would change the ways movies are made (i know thats asking a lot), but would deliver a solid story and character development, with good narration.<br/><br/>all the technical stuff is absolutely spot on, and it will no doubt win awards for effects, editing, sound and so on. but the narration and the script were in desperate need of tweaking.<br/><br/>at times i wondered whether i was watching a film by an egotist gone mad, a work of art, the smurf movie or the most expensive sci-fi ever made.<br/><br/>time will tell.<br/><br/>a good film, but just over-hyped too much.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">A crashing bore. There is almost no real reason to see this film. As you could probably tell from the previews or other plot descriptions, it is a virtual remake of Dances with Wolves, but starring elongated, CGI, blue aliens. Yet even that movie wasn't nearly as patronizing with its noble savage bullcrap. I am not exaggerating when I say I have almost never seen a less imaginative movie. But what about the visuals, you say? Well, they are pretty, and the CGI is better than it has ever been in the past. But I'd say it isn't even close to a huge step forward. A pretty tiny step, really, from The Lord of the Rings' Gollum. The (motion captured) faces look more expressive than Gollum's. But they still have far to go before the CGI creations look \"photo-realistic\", as the idiotic Cameron likes to describe his cartoon characters and settings. And they still haven't worked out just how to move CGI characters - they still don't look like they exist in any kind of real world outside of a computer hard drive. But I guess by now I have to accept filmmakers are always going to rely on CGI, and it's always going to look like a cartoon. I have to say, I did mostly enjoy it when Cameron was introducing new jungle creatures (I think the final tally is about nine different species of animals that live on the planet), but both the flora and the fauna are reminiscent of black light posters and prog-rock album covers (I'll credit Jim Emerson for tipping me toward that, but I knew even in the previews that everything looked a little too familiar). And the N'avi? They're Native Americans. Cameron's allegory is easily the thinnest I've ever seen in a major motion picture. Some critics have argued about how it allegorically relates to current American military woes, but, frankly, if Cameron intended any of it, he screws it up royally by making the N'avi 100% justified in whatever they do. It's every bit as black and white as anything George W. Bush ever said. I'm sure he loves the Hell out of this film. And, even if I tried to just shut off my brain (pretty impossible), so much of the ride is uneventful. If not for the film's final half hour, which is comprised of the big battle, I'd probably call this the worst film of the year. As it is, I'd probably rather sit through Transformers 2 again. At least I can marvel at the audaciousness of Michael Bay's tastelessness. It's better than Cameron's utter blandness.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"Avatar\" is billed as an action, adventure and fantasy film. While it is all of these, it's basic plot and makeup is all science fiction. There's no doubt about the fantastic technical and production qualities of this film. It's a joy just to watch the colorful scenes, sets and creatures of Pandora. CGI clearly has gone to the next level in creating backdrops, sets and scenes for use with live action filming. This is very good fantasy stuff. <br/><br/>With so many reviews already, I won't rehash what others have said. But, I didn't see reference in the comments I scanned to a couple of things worth noting. So, this is to add them to the discussion of this film. A number of others are critical of the film for its lack of originality. It's true that the same themes of the genre of sci-fi and space exploration have been used a great deal before. <br/><br/>The earth has depleted its resources and must find new ones somewhere else. The indigenous creatures of Pandora have their own deity. So, this film has considerable mythology. The new type of bionic man comes into this one with a scientific melding of human and something else. The humans are aliens to this planet or moon, and there is the usual division of some who care about the natives and others who couldn't care less about them. <br/><br/>Much less often, fantasy and sci-fi films will use a writing trait found in classical literature. That is symbolic names and other words. Two leap out in this film. The first is the moon's name, Pandora. From Greek mythology, Pandora's box (or jar) today refers to a plethora of things that can cause havoc or problems. That fits this movie all too well. The second obvious symbolic word is the name for the rare mineral that earth needs, \"unobtanium.\" So, it can't be obtained on earth or elsewhere.<br/><br/>What is a somewhat unique about \"Avatar\" is that it combines all of the above aspects of sci-fi and more. But with so much action and all of the visual spectacles, it makes a plot that is very difficult to follow. When I came out of the theater after seeing this film the first time, I thought about the splendid visual show it was, but also wondered if there was any real point in the plot. It seemed to be just a complex story made to pull together many scenes of action, visual treats, and wild fantasy and sci-fi things. <br/><br/>Watching it again, the visual spectacle is still there, and the plot fades. So, this isn't a film that would be recognized for the original and main crafts of theater - acting and directing. A good analogy might be with what Americans enjoy every year in celebrating the Fourth of July. Whoever tires of watching spectacular fireworks displays? We don't think about the theme, or the reason or the history at that moment. And, year after year we turn out to watch the fireworks again. <br/><br/>\"Avatar\" isn't so much a movie or film with a great story and actors performing in it. It's just a spectacular fireworks display on the silver screen.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">So was the experience worth it? You bet, save for the end credits being unceremoniously cut off toward the end because of another screening. James Cameron is indeed no stranger to science fiction and the creation of new worlds, having been there and done that, even when there are quarters which point to plot similarities. He had continued Ridley Scott's Alien and made the sequel just as, if not even more memorable, having a Titanic film that stood out amongst those created before his technological marvel, gave spy films a good run with his True Lies, and even upping the ante of his own Terminator film with its sequel (which those that followed struggling hard to fill those shoes he left behind).<br/><br/>To say Cameron was a technology junkie is quite the understatement. For each film that he made, there's something new added with a Wow factor, and I still remember to this day the liquid T1000 rising from a patterned floor, making the ugly Harrier jet look sexy, and made us gawk at the recreation of the ill fated ocean liner. Between that film and this one, he had made another 3D documentary exploring the wreckage of the Titanic, and I've watched that on 3D IMAX, which sadly such a hall no longer exists in Singapore. The 3D experience now with Avatar is nothing short of mind-blowing, for the first few minutes at least, and it subconsciously just melts into the background as you continue to enjoy the visuals of the film, hardly noticing the effort that had gone in creating that depth of field or the photo- realism of the fantasy realm of beautiful alien flora and floating mountains, as if you're now watching something real that's unfolding as if you're staring out with your very own eyes, witnessing a perfect blend of live action and computer generated wizardry.<br/><br/>He's created a new world with Avatar, which may have jolly well been Dances with Science Fiction Wolves, or any parallels with other films cutting so close that it's easy to scream plagiarism, but like the title of the film, it's only a vessel in which to tell the story of what's probably a major mind-set shift of how a science fiction 3D film should be like, and exploited for the modern audience. The story has been told countless of times in many different forms, about the prophetic messiah who would come from outside the community, to lead them against adversary. And although the idea has been reported mooted at least a decade back, one cannot but feel how close the concept of Nature Vs Man being all the more relevant now, with that constant reminder that Nature will fight back one day, and Man will be on the losing end should we be up against a concerted force.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington continues his charge as leading man material, even though he's covered in blue and in gangly animated form for more than half the time He's the perennial flawed hero (and I think come complete with touched up limbs) who sees his initial mission as a chance to reclaim what was, only to find that the grass is greener on the other side, due to what else, but love. That pits him against his master, and his dilemma to regain the trust of a community that he had chosen to betray and regret. I can't help but to compare his Marine Jack Sully to Kevin Costner's John Dunbar, with his time spent living amongst the natives (here it's 3 months worth) and to learn their ways, so much so that he's more of them than he is from his own, despite the need to report back, and knowing that they will be the eventual enemy when push comes to shove regarding land and minerals.<br/><br/>And the great good versus evil divide comes from Colonel Miles, played to wicked perfection by Stephen Lang as the war mongering officer who just can't wait to lock and load and pick a fight given any opportunity, and the diplomatic scientist Dr. Grace (Sigourney Weaver) and her crew, who are all for mutual co-existence and the sharing of cultures in a bid to understand what makes the native Na'vi tick, not to mention the countless of secrets that lie hidden in their eco-system, besides some valuable mineral to mine, the largest deposit which is sitting directly under the Na'vi's million year old giant tree.<br/><br/>In the Na'vis, Cameron has created quite the indigenous alien beings complete with a pigtail, which can be used to plug into nature, from binding and controlling just about every living creature (there was a mating scene, though I didn't get to see if this was put to good use), and to plug themselves into a spiritual realm as well. I suppose this provides for plenty of empathy, and I liked the part where Zoe Saldana's Neytiri chides Jake for thanking her when she fatally dispatches the more aggressive beings which in a way, were provoked to action. Action too is something not short of in the film, though one must be patient for that full scale, all out war that was done quite in the mold of Battle For Terra, leaving you without a doubt who to root for.<br/><br/>I don't suppose this film will make as much at the box office as Cameron's last even though it shared that similar romantic angle behind events that are of a higher magnitude. Instant classic this is not, but Avatar has its moments, primed for a sequel or even for an expanded television series, that could continue on its ecological message, its technical wizardry, or just plain old narrative familiarity that could put the spotlight on the other hastily added clans that made up the final stretch.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">There's no doubt that, had I seen \"Avatar\" in theaters, my reaction would've been kinder. You can still get caught up in the world of Pandora on the small screen (to some extent) and appreciate all of the work that Cameron put into realizing it, but that's really the selling point here. If you take away the 3D and the big screen, this is rehash of familiar stories and recycled characters. Seriously, just take the characters from \"Aliens\" and cast new actors. Even Weaver's playing a bitchier version of Ripley here. Throw in the world's most obvious bad guy and professional-vacuum-of-charisma Sam Worthington (not to mention the big loaders), and you've essentially got the biggest selling movie in history. That's what was so disappointing about \"Avatar\"; it's wholly derivative. of better Cameron movies.<br/><br/>Serious disappointment. <br/><br/>4/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Show, blasphemy, tale, parable, moral lesson ,game for old children, provocation, another skin for cartoons, ecological recipes , travel in the past with the arms of future, trash, masterpiece. Avatar is a piece of clay. It is what you desire. A Rubik cube or kaleidoscope. For me it was only a surprise. A delicate plea for fundamental problems.Search of essence of childhood and solutions for problems with the measure of first ages. Declaration of love and explosion of imagination. In same case, foolish travel.Too much, too strong, more colors, smells and flies. Huge cake with strange slices. A holiday in an universe -freak and familiar. A song. Chopin in skin of Mahler. Mozart in the velvet of Komeda. Bach in the waters of Jean Michel Jarre. Must see. For imagine nuances of this thing.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It is hard to enjoy a movie about the fight against greedy oppressors when the entire plot is based on cheap exploitation of the viewer's feelings. I agree it was a great experience, as the CGI were amazing, but the story made no more sense than a children's tale. Evil and stupid villains, pure hearted heroes that are equally mindless, peaceful nature loving folk (that always walk around armed to the teeth) that are to be saved by the hero, otherwise completely lost, etc.<br/><br/>I swear to you, one could make a film with the same script in some highschool, where the hero comes in a BMW and saves the day and gets the girl (only here it's a flying carnivore).<br/><br/>I also watched in 3D, but I was unimpressed. Basically, there are parts of the scene that are focused differently, getting that weird effect you see at \"3D\" cardboard pictures that you raise in children books. I can only assume that it was a movie like any other movie and then they worked on it to make it 3Dish.<br/><br/>Bottom line: as the script and the 3D experience both forced me to think of children's tales in children books, I can't say that I was really satisfied. After all, I am not a child anymore. But if you expect this to be true (and I was when I went to see the movie) you can enjoy it just like any other easy weekend movie and get immersed into the atmosphere of things.<br/><br/>As a side note (bottom lines and side notes... I am making a 3D review here!) I don't agree that Cameron does silly movies and I should have expected this. Aliens, The Abyss and Terminator all had some complex scripts behind them, even when we were drowning in special effects. Using such a plain plot for the movie is, in my personal view, inexcusable.<br/><br/>And as a funny note: this is a movie that you need glasses to see, about a guy that needs a computerized link to walk in order to connect through some weird external neural links in order to fly.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"I am as free as Nature first made man, Ere the base laws of servitude began, When wild in woods the noble savage ran.\" John Dryden<br/><br/>Fifteen years and half a billion dollars later, writer/director James Cameron once again has invested wisely (if you thought Titanic was just good luck--not). A couple of weeks out and it already has sold a billion dollars world-wide. It is worth every penny and every moment the writer/director has given to the project.<br/><br/>Sometime in the future, paraplegic Marine veteran Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) goes to the planet Pandora to be involved in an integration initiative with the indigenous crowd and get his legs repaired as reward. Such imperialism means these invaders never heard the Star Trek prime non-integration directive or saw the recent Battle for Terra.<br/><br/>The native Na'Vi are not happy to be invaded, and the earthlings are pressing hard to move them elsewhere to get at the valuable resources under their home. If this all sounds like our Wild West crossed with Vietnam, on an allegorical level it is. The US's wars of the 19th and 20th centuries are well represented, and the allusions to Apocalypse Now, including the Robert Duval Major Kilgore village strafing sequence, are obvious but welcome as I remembered how effectively Frances Ford Coppola captured the absurdity of war.<br/><br/>The natives are noble savages, less Rousseau (\"Man was born free, and everywhere he is in chains\") and more Maori while physically lean and lithe. Native histories, legends, and myths are present, from the Garden of Eden to Wounded Knee and any mono myth in between where the young are the warriors who must travel and learn about other cultures to preserve their own.<br/><br/>The forest is a venue for religion, a pantheism that links the natives socially and spiritually. The contrast between the benign forces of Mother Nature and the technological indifference of the occupiers is not subtle. Although I can't give you the technical explanation of Cameron's graphics innovations, I can say they eclipse any blockbuster CGI I have seen so far. Soaring reptiles and magical horses carrying heroes to their fate and forest behemoths in the service of the natives are but a few of the delights in Cameron's first reel of his unreality.<br/><br/>As the clichéd story of bitter invasion takes over, more predictable action takes over, but the characters are so attractive and the story so metaphorically accurate, the film adjusts between geeks and those who just like a rousing good story.<br/><br/>\"You are not in Kansas anymore. You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.\" Col. Quaritch (Stephen Lang)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"Avatar\" without a doubt pushes the movie making limit and that can be expected since it's a James Cameron film who's a master of sci-fi and adventure fantasy films. And with this latest he clearly pushes the envelope with the graphics of digital computer 3-D and CGI which is becoming more and more common in film. Still if you don't get caught up in all of the special things you will find that this film \"Avatar\" is a journey of wonder, adventure, and excitement that involves exploring new lands and new people of a different culture. Neat and crazy to look at the blue aliens and winged creatures. Yet this is a Cameron film it's all about going big to far out lands and pushing the imagination to the max.<br/><br/>The story centers around a paraplegic ex marine Jake Sully(Sam Worthington)who enters an experimental government program that is being ran by a group of scientists. Dr. Grace Augustine(the veteran Sigourney Weaver)is the bitchy programmer of the experiments, which involves putting humans like Jake into compartments that travel them into the distant moon planet of Pandora. With the goal to extract and find the planet's natural resources from the resident aliens that live on the planet who are called the Na'vi. And along the way just like any other planet conflicts, drama, bonding, and war will be found yet most notable is the unlikely love found with Jake's guide that's once he's blue occupied and that happens to be the lovely Neytiri. And this is a fun experimental ride all the way in which the blue alien culture of Na'vi's come to be saved.<br/><br/>With the technology and effects combined with the journey this film takes of showing a future world it certainly lets a viewers imagination run wild. True this genre of film may not be everyone's cup of tea yet it's one to be looked at and respected due to the masterful and precise work of one of the great directors such as James Cameron.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I really felt that The Legendary filmmaker surpassed Cinema in 'True Lies' &amp; 'Titanic', but after watching his latest offering 'Avatar', I am left awe-struck.<br/><br/>Nothing on earth can stop 'Avatar', An Outstanding Piece Of Work That Will Shine Till The Day Cinema Lives! A Visual Delight!<br/><br/>'Avatar' is an Outstanding film, I have never enjoyed a film so so so much. Cameron takes you in the world of Pandora, he takes you to the roots, he sucks you into this filmy world completely. 'Avatar' even shows the selfish side of us, \"Human Beings', how far can we go for our needs. Cameron's supremacy returns, it's been 12 years, agreed... so what, he gives a film that we'll remember forever! 'Avatar' cannot be missed by anyone, and I mean anyone!! <br/><br/>Performance wise, Sam Worthington is superb as Jake Sully, playing his part with great understanding. Zoe Saldana as Neytiri, though she's an animation throughout, she has dubbed beautifully. Sigourney Weaver is first-rate as usual. Stephen Lang is fabulous as the conniving bad-man. Giovanni Ribisi is superb in a brief role. Michelle Rodriguez is in form after a long, long time. She excels. Joel Moore as Norm is likable. Others, the rest of Na'vi are perfect.<br/><br/>James Cameron's 'Avatar' is a film that shines, with a rare aura. Go visit Pandora right now! Watching this film should be a agenda for a Cinema Fan Forever! Twenty Big Thumbs Up!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is polarizing with its effects, but ordinary with its storytelling and plot. It shows off explicitly impressive graphics and exquisite acting, but still, when discussing plot elements, you'd like to say the film does something bigger and badder to commemorate the hype. Sadly, it gives us traditional storyline - one of the few letdowns of the film.<br/><br/>But I'm making it sound like I didn't enjoy this one bit. Avatar is a beautifully made, work of film art in the sense of almost every medium it utilizes. Including the obligatory 3D, which is used surprisingly more as a visual enhancer than a gimmick.<br/><br/>It's the year 2154, a handicapped man named Jake Sully is sent to an RDA corporation in replace of his brother who had recently passed away. Unlike his brother, Jake has basically no idea of what to do or what to expect during the project. The main objective is to create avatars the humans control to explore the world of Pandora. Pandora is populated by a paleolithic form of blue skin creatures, taller than humans, and resembling a feline form. The texture and detail in the creatures is spectacular and a true visual work of art.<br/><br/>That's all I want to give away, and even with that it looks as if I've said too much. Avatar develops the love story like we'd expect, but even in its cliché state it feels Cameron did all he could to prevent the predictable turnout. Still, it's not that the story is completely intolerable.<br/><br/>The effects, like you'd expect, consume the entire extravaganza. To begin with, Cameron is known for his revolutionary filmmaking, expensive budgets, and big name actors. Avatar is no exception to any of those rules. The film has a unique look to it in more ways than one. But in the effect field, it shines vibrantly. It's a technical breakthrough, possible paving the way for a new generation of movies to follow and live up to.<br/><br/>I think what I enjoyed the most from Avatar is its constant action. The film's plot isn't thick, but it seems to have so much happening, so much going on, and so much unfolding it's almost impossible to look away. That's one of the highest compliments of any film; the fact that it is never a bore to watch. It's consistently entertaining and achieves an extremely difficult greatness.<br/><br/>Avatar is more a breakthrough than anything. It is an imaginative work of art in every field but the storytelling. There's going to be three categories of fans for this film; people that love the film and everything about it, people, like me, who are pleased but not blown away by the turnout, and the people that show their inner cynic and hate the film and everyone who loves it. I will say the film doesn't force you to like it. If it did, we wouldn't have that third category.<br/><br/>Starring: Sam Worthington, Zoë Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Giovanni Ribisi. Directed by: James Cameron.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">You wanna know something funny? Not even a year ago, early 2009, I was watching \"The Directors\" on the Reelz Channel and James Cameron was on. I was talking to my friend and saying how he is one of my favorite directors, he has an amazing track record of great movies, but wait, has he done anything since Titanic? I went on the net to check to see what he has done since Titanic and it says nothing but documentaries and he was working on a film called Avatar. I read a little about the movie and then a few months later came the trailer and I was just in awe. I was extremely curious to see this movie and couldn't wait as when we hear the name James Cameron, you can't help but expect nothing but greatness. The man is a perfectionist and it shows, he always goes above and beyond what he needs to do for a film and we got that with Avatar. My only complaint being like Titanic, the story not being the most original on the market, but I can't at all hate this movie. Originally wanting give this movie a 9 rating, I find myself thinking that I can't. This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I have ever seen in my life. My boyfriend and I saw this in 3D and I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. James Cameron is back and I hope he never leaves Hollywood again as this was the breath of fresh air that we needed with Avatar.<br/><br/>In 2154, the RDA corporation is mining Pandora, a lush, Earth-like moon of the planet Polyphemus, in the Alpha Centauri star system. Humans cannot survive exposure to Pandora's atmosphere for very long and use gas masks. In an attempt to improve relations with the natives, scientists create human-Na'vi hybrids called avatars, controlled by genetically-matched human operators. Jake Sully, a former marine, becomes a last-minute replacement for his murdered identical twin brother, a scientist trained to be an avatar operator. Dr. Grace Augustine, the head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement for his brother, and relegates him to a bodyguard role. Jake escorts Augustine and biologist Norm Spellman on an exploratory mission in their avatar forms to make contact with the Na'vi in order to help establish diplomatic relations, solve the problem of resources and end the threat of violence. The group is attacked by a predator, and Jake becomes separated and lost. Forced to survive the night in Pandora's dangerous jungles, he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Neytiri brings Jake to Hometree, which is inhabited by Neytiri's clan, the Omaticaya. Mo'at, the Na'vi shaman and Neytiri's mother, shows interest in the warrior \"Dream-walker\", and instructs her daughter to teach Jake their ways.<br/><br/>I had another fellow IMDb user e-mail me a week ago asking me about my thoughts on the movie and he informed me that Cameron has been working on the story for years(many thanks to oldman007 for the info) and just now had the opportunity to work on it. I think that Cameron did a great thing by taking a break from movies as not only could he retire a good 25 times from the money he made on Titanic but we had an opportunity to appreciate him even more for Avatar. 2009 was kind of a lousy year for films and this was the movie that we needed to have that sigh of relief. From the actors, the special effects, the visuals, and the way the story is told was orchestrated like a perfect night at the theater with an standing ovation from the audience as everyone wanted more despite the 150 minute running time.<br/><br/>I'm sure Avatar is sure to be in for the run during Oscar time, wither it gets a best picture nod or not, I'm not sure, but from what I've seen this does deserve every award it can get. I feel very bad if I'm over hyping the film too much for you, I don't want people to get the wrong idea that this is the Casablanca of the new millennium, but it really was just a relief that we still have potential in Hollywood to put out a great movie. Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana stole the show and I think the reason being is because Cameron can make females very strong, beautiful, but doesn't over do it with his actresses and always knows what he wants from them and they deliver. Sam Worthington as the leading man, Jake, I was a bit worried as I saw Terminator: Salvation which was like spitting in James Cameron's face, he was the star in that film too and I thought he was going to just suck the life out of this film. Thankfully I was wrong and he pulled in a strong enough performance to carry the film with some incredible actors beside him. Avatar is very much worth the look on the big screen, it's a masterpiece.<br/><br/>10/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Leave it to James Cameron to release the first real blockbuster of the current wave of 3-D films coming to your movie theaters. The $400 million dollar quoted budget for this film definitely shows. The special effects get a 10 because of that money. This film in a way is Titanic two, as it appeals to the same audience as his former blockbuster. This, Camerons next film appeals to the same audience in exactly the same way using exactly the same formula.<br/><br/>That formula is - an extremely big budget, technical stuff to draw in the men, &amp; a love story to draw in the women. Now add the 3d &amp; animation to bring in the kids too, and this audience is even more complete than Titanic was. <br/><br/>With this in mind, if you want to see 3D done right, go to this movie &amp; note the previews of at least 2 other 3D films coming up. This is not your Grandapas 1950's 3D process, this is state of the art.<br/><br/>The film manages to appeal to a wide swath of audience too. There is plenty of romance for the ladies, plenty of action for that audience, some amazing imaginative creature, plant &amp; animal creations for the naturalist, &amp; just enough plot twist to keep you watching.<br/><br/>The plot is what pulls this film down from a 10. I can see what they tried to do here with the plot in appealing to folks that are in the going \"Green\" movement. It has a major appeal that direction. Especially telling is the description of the planet trees &amp; nature interconnecting into a massive network described like a computer network to try &amp; draw in the Techno Geeks as well. There is a Natural Force Network for those who like that appeal.<br/><br/>You have the Technological Society, (Jake is from Earth as he served in Venezuela) &amp; the \"dying world\" description. Then you have the Pandora world which is presented as an entirely natural world with a rare supply of a valuable resource that the other world needs (a stretch here but greed is a good plot toy). Man types versus Pandorian tribes &amp; animals is the set up here. Including the THX special effects, there are lots of cross references to Star Wars in this film.<br/><br/>To me, it is way to pessimistic to refer to Earth as a \"dying world\". Venezuela is specifically referenced, which makes it ironic as we are trying to save the Earth on Earth day &amp; the DVD is first released on Earth Day week-end. According to this movie, we'd better double our Earth day efforts. That analogy is way too simplistic because as long as man doesn't nuke his own world entirely, this planet is not dying. What is great about our planet is that like the theory of evolution, our planet evolves &amp; survives. Man is capable of destroying himself due to modern weapons. Man is in no way capable of destroying this planet. In fact, the next 50 years could be the most exciting yet in our planets history. Human History is full of Climate Change &amp; the climate has &amp; will always change. <br/><br/>Pandora is painted with a broad brush as a natural Utopia which would be perfect though wild &amp; rough if not for the alien invaders. The Pandorans don't even seem to need to farm, though they do hunt. This simplistic black versus white plot is OK for the first major commercial 3D release with this new process, but as people realize how simplistic these two sides are presented, the plot falls apart. In the real universe, two sides are never that simple.<br/><br/>The battle sequence in this movie pulls in viewers in the second half at is combines elements of The Empire Strikes Back &amp; Return of The Jedi into one movie. That's getting your money's worth. There is enough here to get lots of viewers, particularly ones who want to be dazzled by 3D effects, &amp; pessimistic folks who believe that man is really destroying our planet. For those who want a more complicated real world type of plot, this one will fall short. A fine Fantasy this is.</div>,\n",

There are interesting online newspaper articles on the subject like \"Real-world beaming: The risk of avatar and robot crime\" and \"Russian billionaire reveals real-life 'avatar' plan\".

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Well this is the event movie of the year I guess. It's currently on the rounds making shed loads of money, its huge success I think is down to the clever idea of presenting it in 3D, meaning that it is seen as a very cinematic experience, i.e. you have to pay to go see it! Admittedly the CGI is very impressive and the 3D effects are integrated in a surprisingly subtle way – there is a distinct lack of gimmicky 3D effects that are designed to make the viewer jump. This is a sensible approach in my opinion as such things really only serve to take the viewer out of the film, so James Cameron has to be commended for his restraint here. I do have to say at this point, however, that I am hardly a CGI fanatic. I am, in fact, incredibly unexcited when I hear a film has amazing CGI. It just doesn't interest me very much. That said, it did seem obvious to me that the effects here were pretty impressive. So if that's your thing, then this film will very possibly rock your boat.<br/><br/>While the effects are groundbreaking, the same cannot be said of everything else. The story is trite beyond belief. It's ridiculously predictable. The sort of thing you've seen a hundred times before. It's amazing to me that Cameron took 12 years out to make this movie, yet could not think of anything story-wise than only the most overused clichés. After about an hour-and-a-half, once I had had my fill of the alien world, I started to find it almost impossible to care what happened to these blue cat-people. They were so tediously worthy that I began to think that the gung-ho army guys might have a point. Completely unreasonable of me I know but there you have it – Avatar temporarily turned me into a warmonger. Cheers Cameron.<br/><br/>Even as I am writing this review, I realise that it is one of the most pointless things I will ever do, as only a month after Avatar's release it already has amassed over 1,800 reviews on the IMDb alone, so the chances of anyone actually ever even reading what I have written above is close to non-existent.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I'm not sure that film-making can get any better than this. I have a gut reaction to want to dislike James Cameron's blockbusters. I avoid them like the plague for the longest time before finally deciding to give in to the hype and check them out. Years ago I had that gut reaction to \"Titanic\" and then was completely blown away when I watched it. I've had the same experience with \"Avatar\" - a movie that I had no interest in watching, but now that I have has left me breathless. It's Cameron's best work ever - superior even to \"Titanic,\" which I loved once I watched it.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning in many ways. The world of Pandora (a moon of a distant gas planet) comes to life in every way, from the Na'vi tribe around whom the movie revolves to the various animals that inhabit the world to the trees and the sky - it was all real. The animation and computer-generated characters used to portray the Na'vi were breathtakingly real. There's only a hint every now and then (usually in their movement and not in their appearance) that these are in fact computer-generated characters and for the most part it's easy to forget that these aren't actors in makeup. The visuals alone make this a must-see and even if the story had been lacking would have made this a worthwhile movie. But the story wasn't at all lacking.<br/><br/>Cameron (who also developed the story and wrote the script) created an emotionally moving story that pulls no punches and hits a number of buttons so that the viewer gets the underlying message but never feels preached at. It's an epic adventure movie that reminds us of some of the tragedies of our own history and warns us of some of the dangers in our own future. <br/><br/>The first parallel that came across to me was the clash of cultures. I immediately thought of the tragic encounters between native Americans and Europeans of centuries ago from which native Americans still haven't recovered. The story revolves around a team of scientists and marines sent to Pandora to study the planet but (and more importantly) to mine the planet for an ore that's worth an astronomical price back on earth. Greed overcomes curiosity quickly, and the marines begin to play centre stage almost from the beginning, as it becomes obvious that the \"company\" financing this mission is willing to go to any lengths to get this precious metal. They'll make cursory attempts to talk the natives off the land, but if that doesn't work (and one gets the distinct impression that they don't really want it to work) they're quite prepared (and even eager) to force the natives off the land and kill them if necessary. Sound familiar? The next parallel (or rather, mirror image, I suppose) was the reverse take on \"alien invasion\" movies. Here, it's clear that we're the alien invaders, simply looking to rape a world of everything in it that's valuable with no regard or concern for the world's indigenous inhabitants. It's interesting to see humanity portrayed in a different light.<br/><br/>The aspect of the story that I appreciated the most, I think, was the extremely spiritual nature of the film. The Na'vi have a connection with creation that is deeply moving and that draws the sympathy of the viewer almost from the beginning - sympathy turning to anger as humans begin to destroy the world that the Na'vi are so interconnected with. The spirituality of this clan and of how it affects their interactions with the world, with each other and with these alien invaders is truly interesting to watch as it's slowly unfolded for us. This is not a Hollywood movie that disses spirituality. Instead, it seems to cut to the heart of spirituality and to what spirituality should be about - the building of community and of relationships, and the glue that holds those things together. Very much related to this is a soft-sell but noticeable if you pay attention environmental message. As the Na'vi see their world being plundered, the point is made that these humans have already done away with all \"the green\" on their own planet and are now going to do the same to Pandora, and - at the end - as the marines pull out, the point was made that they were returning to \"their dying world.\" It never felt like a \"preachy\" environmental message to me, but it was obvious and well made - perhaps making the point more effectively than if it had been the centre point of the story.<br/><br/>The performances here were great. Sam Worthington as Jake Scully is a character to root for. He's the paraplegic marine who inhabits a genetically engineered Na'vi body (his avatar) and - as he comes to know the tribe - becomes increasingly sympathetic to them, to the point of wanting to be one of them. Zoe Saldana was great as Neytiri - the Na'vi female with whom Jake falls in love - and Sigourney Weaver was convincing as Dr. Grace Augustine, the head scientist who gradually comes to realize that science is the least concern of the company that has sent her and her team to Pandora. Perhaps the best performance, though, was that of Stephen Lang as Colonel Quaritch - the commander of the marine unit. He was gung ho about taking over the world, ice cold with no sympathy at all for or interest in the Na'vi. He was truly a frightening character. For a movie that is in many ways very gentle and spiritual, it also leads up to a stunningly portrayed final battle scene as the Na'vi take on their human invaders, and to a marvellous final confrontation between Jake and Quaritch.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant movie; truly, in my opinion, one of the best ever made.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">'AVATAR: SPECIAL EDITION': Five Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>I just saw this movie for the fifth time (including two past viewings in 2D, one of them being on Blu-ray) and I have to say seeing this 'special edition' re-release, with an extra nine minutes of footage in IMAX 3D, is like a whole new movie going experience. First of all seeing it on an IMAX 3D screen is like a spectacular new and visually stunning way of seeing a movie. It feels like the movie seriously surrounds you and you're apart of what's going on on screen! The amazing visuals and astonishing 3D of 'AVATAR' make this a once in a life time type of experience. There's also the new footage, including four entirely new scenes that add new depth and a completely new way of viewing key plot points of the film. A couple of scenes even alter the story somewhat. It was not only visually mind blowing but an entirely new way of seeing the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>For those who don't know the movie it tells the story of a paraplegic marine named Jake Sully (Played by the now famous Sam Worthington). When Jake's twin brother is killed he's asked to take his place in an expensive military project on the alien world of Pandora, due to the fact that he has matching DNA to his brother. There he's asked to link to an 'avatar' body which is a physical body made up of a marines DNA matching that of a planet native, known as Na'vi, which is piloted mentally by the marine. His assignment is to use the 'avatar' to infiltrate the Na'vi, gain their trust and convince them to move from their land so an unnamed corporation can gain control of all the valuable mineral there. This of course draws many parallels to current and past corrupt business and military involved situations.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely emotional and enlightening as well as the best damn visual experience ever put on film. It draws inspiration from other great films like 'RETURN OF THE JEDI', 'DANCES WITH WOLVES' and heavily from writer / director James Cameron's own classic 'ALIENS' but it's also like nothing you've ever seen before, a truly unique film going experience. Cameron is my all time favorite director (Just look at his track record: 'TERMINATOR', 'ALIENS', 'THE ABYSS', 'TERMINATOR 2', 'TRUE LIES', 'TITANIC'. These are all some of my all time favorite movies!) but this in many ways far exceeds anything he's ever done before! I saw the movie once again with my friends Ed and Erika, as I did the midnight showing on it's original opening night, and they both agree it's a five star movie and one of their all time favorite films as well.<br/><br/>The added footage is so good it does make you wonder why it was ever deleted to begin with; I get the argument that it was to shorten an overly long film (for marketing reasons) but these new scenes are much better and more important to the film than much of the footage left in the original version. James Cameron has released far superior extended versions of his films in the past (like the special editions of 'TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY', 'ALIENS' and 'THE ABYSS') and it almost seems like he saves key footage so he can release a better version later down the road, much the way it felt with director Peter Jackson special editions of 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' trilogy. I do believe if you're a fan of the film this special edition is worth another visit to the theater to see, especially in IMAX 3D, and I still stand by my argument that it's one of the greatest films ever made; twice now it's been one of the best single cinematic experiences I've ever had! I think it's an important film and an astonishingly beautiful one as well and if you're a fan of film and the whole film-making process like I am than I think you have to agree. Film is the most collaborative art form there is, and that's why it's my favorite, and 'AVATAR' is arguably the greatest example of this. It's an artistic masterpiece in my opinion as well as one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"Avatar\" is James Cameron's $237 million parable on the evils of imperialism, corporatism and Manifest Destiny.<br/><br/>The time is 2154, the place an earthlike moon called Pandora, where an American company has set up a major mining operation to extract a precious mineral - presumably an energy source - from beneath the planetoid's lush, verdant surface. The problem is that one of the richest veins lies directly under a massive tree that holds great spiritual significance for the indigenous folk who live there - a race of nine-foot-tall, blue-complexioned natives called the Na'vi who dwell in the forest, wield old-fashioned bows-and-arrows, fly around on giant pterodactyl-type birds, and have a strong pantheistic connection with the world around them.<br/><br/>As the story begins, it is clear that, thus far, the earthlings have had very limited success in winning over the Na'vi through such outreach efforts as building them schools and teaching them English. Fortunately, a group of scientists have found a way to create facsimiles of the Na'vi - called Avatars - into which a human mind can be transported while the original body remains behind in a state of suspended animation. Enter Jake Sully, a young marine who's lost the use of his legs in battle and now has been chosen to enter into an avatar so he can learn more about the Na'vi by living amongst them in the hopes of eventually winning them over to the Americans' side. Unfortunately, not everyone is as concerned with making nice with the Na'vi as is Grace Augustine, the humanistic biologist who heads up the research, and Jake soon discovers that the more he comes to feel like a Na'vi himself, the more he is expected to spy on and then betray his new-found compatriots in the earthlings' cause. Jake's gradual transition from cocky, human-centric warrior to nature-loving ersatz-alien provides the dramatic and thematic arc of the film.<br/><br/>The parallels between the conflict in \"Avatar\" and America's involvement in the Iraq war are never far from Cameron's mind and the movie suffers a bit for it (ironically, \"Avatar\" is a far more overtly political film than \"The Hurt Locker\" which is actually SET in Iraq). I suspect that, had he wanted to, Cameron could probably have gotten his point across without taking a narrative sledgehammer to the audience. Heck, there's even a reference to \"shock and awe\" as the Americans gear up for battle, just in case you missed the inference. That being said, \"Avatar\" is enough of a technical triumph to overcome its occasional heavy-handed polemical tendencies and to successfully take us to a place we've never been before.<br/><br/>Through the wizardry of computer-generated 3-D special effects, Cameron has created a magical world of shimmering forests, floating mountains, and strange and exotic flora and fauna - a place where love can convincingly flourish between creatures from alien worlds and alien species. In fact, the romance between Jake and a female Na'vi who teaches him the ways of her people - an even more unlikely coupling than Rose and Jack in \"Titanic\" - has something of a \"New World\" quality about it. And, indeed, Cameron's near-worshipful attitude towards nature here echoes Terrance Malick's work in that earlier film. Actually, that seems a particularly appropriate reference point given that \"Avatar\" can easily be viewed as an allegory of the European white man's conquest of the American continent and the genocide perpetrated on the native population that played such a crucial role in bringing that outcome about. The look of the movie is something akin to a John Howe painting done in bold florescent colors and placed under a black light.<br/><br/>Of the performers, it's frankly a little hard to evaluate fully Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana's work in this film since clearly much of what appears on screen is the product of CGI manipulation and enhancement. But they're both certainly adequate to the task they've been called upon to fulfill, and Sigourney Weaver as Grace and Giovanni Ribisi as the corporate administrator for the mine - and the movie's arch villain - turn in genuinely powerful performances. And once again, as with \"Titanic,\" James Horner provides a soaring power-ballad to help transition the audience out of the theater and back into the real world.<br/><br/>Almost inevitably, perhaps, \"Avatar\" is one of those movies wherein the storyline is bound to become at least partially subsumed by the special effects. But, as he did with \"Titanic\" - though to a somewhat lesser extent in this case - Cameron proves that he is capable of finding that happy medium between the two sides better than most.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I hesitated, almost a full month, before seeing Avatar, a movie that apparently the world saw first. And when I saw world, I mean everyone, even people who have never see a movie, or even have the technology or places to go to see movies, saw it. I delayed my viewing as it was not a movie I was interested in seeing in the first place and the trailer made me snicker at the tall, skinny Smurf people.<br/><br/>But, I broke down and saw it, as I knew I was going to see it anyways and the small screen, or even a 60\" would probably not do the large scale/action flick justice. Even further, I needed to see it in IMAX-3-D just to get the whole effect. Was I disappointed? Yes and no.<br/><br/>The special effects were amazing as was the cinematography. That was breathtaking. But the FX and scenery was only good when\n",
       " the blue people (or the Na'vi) weren't on the screen. Yes, I realize they're on practically the whole time you enjoy the rest of the CGI-world of Pandora, and I think the technology has thoroughly advanced through the years, but I just didn't buy it. I just didn't think they're there just yet. I almost laughed each time I saw them, but I never truly believed them to be anything but computer generated images. Everything else, aside from one of the dog-like creatures looked absolutely fabulous.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving. For example, as stunning as the 90% of the graphics were, in addition to the flights, the story looked as old and stale as most of the moments in human history it mimicked. I guess it was no secret the plot is without any teeth or any bit of originality, so stating it's a VERY A-B-C movie is just irrelevant. My guess is they (or just King Cameron) knew this, he's not stupid, and just said let's just throw in as many tricks/CGI/gadgets as they could possibly think of as distractions to deter from the central plot. It is very well known to people I associate with, that story comes first, always. I could be thrown a million things (even in 3-D) but that doesn't stop me from looking deeper for anything resembling not only originality, but heart.<br/><br/>Was the movie bad? No, I wouldn't go that far, but the race to cover up the lack-of-story with a billion FX kinda got old and made me look at the time more than once. Not only was I kinda bored with the attempts to impress me, but I was still waiting for the basic \"C\" elements of the A-B-C plot-formula (which, mercifully, finally arrived.) The basic storyline (a Dances with Wolves with the Titanic theme – dang, I got really frustrated with hearing Titanic all throughout this film, because Titanic was 12x better a movie) involves a last minute death of a man who was supposed to inhabit a Na'vi body in the long-distant future in order to infiltrate an alien species on another planet. His mission was to bring back information or (ha-ha, like I believed this) negotiate a \"relocation\" of the Na'vi so that Earthmen can harvest a rare substance in order to reboot Planet Earth after humans did a fine job of destroying it.<br/><br/>Well, thank goodness, the dead spy had a twin brother, but unfortunately, he's also paralyzed from the waist down. That doesn't really matter when your mind is transferred to a 12' Na'vi body. I'm spending way too much time on this 15-minute-plot, so I'll fast forward (and it's no shocker when it's all spoiled in the previews, anyways.) He joins scientists, gets separated and meets up with a Na'vi (or make that naïve) woman, Naytiri (Saldana,) who spiritually think he's the chosen one.<br/><br/>She trains him while he remains loyal to a very bad man (or high ranking military cliché who works for someone so incredibly cartoonish – Parker (Ribisi) – that I had to laugh at every unbelievable moment he was on screen.) But lo! He starts to see life in the blue, becomes one of the blue and its: Red, White and Blue vs. the other Blue.<br/><br/>The handicapped character-turned-spy, Jake (Worthington, or, again, I should say Worthless,) is so brain-dead that whenever Naytiri hits him in the forehead and calls him a child, I wanted to join her, but instead just punch him. Yes, I get the fact they wanted to show a transformation, but this extremely-dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks was so hard to watch, it should've been played by Keanu Reeves who might have given him more depth as a surfer-dude.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it? For special effects and fantastic scenery/scope, alone and the inevitable \"Ewoks\" finale made up for a lot of the movie's downfalls. Obviously, the general movie public (or in this case the entire Earth) likes familiarity. I, on the other hand, like to be amazed by screenplays that took more than a few hours to construct.<br/><br/>Either way, I would recommend, if you would ever see it, you need to see it on the big screen. I did, and I am thankful, now that I did and saw little to no depth, I can safely save money on foreseeable future Avatar sequels.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Arguably the most visually impressive movie I have ever seen, featuring perhaps the best CGI ever put to film, this feast-for-the-eyes proves what you can do with the right amount of money, time and passion. 'Avatar (2009)' wows today almost as much as it did back when it was first released. It's also worth noting that it represents one of the only times 3D has enhanced an experience, with even the home-video release sporting great depth-enhancing effects and a general emphasis on bringing you into its world rather than forcing it out at you. The story may be lacking in originality, the characters are somewhat generic and it is certainly too long but the breath-taking sights and fantastic action make this an enjoyable ride that should be experienced by all fans of cinema. 7/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar isn't by any means a great movie, but it is a stunningly beautiful one. The design of the alien creatures and alien landscape is superb, a fully realized world of great beauty.<br/><br/>Take away that stunning beauty and you've got an okay but unexceptional action flick. The story is by-the-numbers, a clichéd noble-savage vs. evil empire script that is well-intentioned but unoriginal. Still, the movie moves quickly, the action is engaging and the experience is ultimately shallow but satisfying.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how I feel about the 3D aspect. Sure, it's the best I've seen in terms of 3D technology (I haven't seen a 3D movie in many years), but I'm not sold on 3D yet. I kind of feel this movie would be just as pretty flat, and that often the 3D effect was a little distracting. But it may just be something I'm not used to.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Beastly epic scifi war drama fantasy lol. beautiful shots and mesmerizing scenes. one of the most visually stunning movies of all time. and as the first big 3D movie, it was groundbreaking. lots of moving scenes. and i am able to relate to the plight of the blue people (about 4 viewings)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">So what do I mean when I say I eat my words? Well it annoyed me that the fact that James Cameron was the sole reason to see Avatar. Yes he's a renowned director but I don't even consider him in the same league as a Spielberg or a Scorcese (not that I am a huge fan of Scorcese personally.) I didn't quite understand the \"visionary\" everyone thought he was. Yes he's done some solid action/sci-fi flicks and yes he managed to direct Titanic to record breaking greatness but was this enough to base Avatar solely on? Well I miss the Titanic of boats because James Cameron's decade long labor of love might be at the very least one of the great film epics ever made. Hands down if nothing else Avatar is the most visually stunning piece of film you will ever see (and I didn't see it in 3D YET.) As many have said the CGI in the film which is practically 99% of the entire film is nearly flawless and the work put into the Na'vi people especially the main characters is just amazing. Add in the fact that there are some genuinely incredible performances and an entire world built from the ground up and sci-fi lovers will be floored this creation. It still won't be the type of film to reach out to all genres but it is quite possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington is quickly becoming someone to watch for in Hollywood. He leads the cast in Avatar with skill and a brooding personality. Unfortunately for him Worthington is not the strongest in this cast. He does well and yet his character doesn't have nearly the depth of some of the others. Still this should do amazing things for his future. Zoe Saldana on the other hand is mind blowingly brilliant. She gives the performance of her career and does it all behind the shadow of a CGI character proving that talent and brilliance can shine through even in voice and computer capture. Her character shows so much incredible emotion and is so brilliant, she should be given an Oscar just for those merits alone. She is stunning. Sigourney Weaver slips back into sci-fi brilliance as Dr. Grace Augustine. She goes through a range of personality changes but is definitely a character you can feel empathy for. Yes she also smokes in the movie...please get over it. It's a character flaw, millions smoke. And just as a side note this woman who is a lovely FIFTY NINE YEARS OLD...looks incredible. Stephen Lang gives us a performance that just may be one of the great film villains of all time. First of all he simply looks bad ass. Second of all he gives a strong, surly, performance that admittedly is a little two dimensional (get the irony) he serves his purpose as evil villain and pulls it off amazingly. Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi (amazing cameo role), Joel Moore (great character actor) and the entire cast that play the supporting Na'Vi characters are all brilliant in their own way. Some stand out more than others but the entire cast comes together perfectly.<br/><br/>I just always though director and writer James Cameron had a run of good luck with Titanic and his earlier works in Aliens and True Lies and creating the Terminator world. But when you look at his body of work he's never done a bad movie. The man knows science fiction and Avatar has really been his thesis, his ultimate show and he accomplished it in a big way. Maybe I'm over hyping the film but it's just been a really long time since I was riveted to my seat, transported like this film did for me in the theater, make me want to see it again the moment the credits wrapped. If you are one of the people who has not contributed to the 1.4 billion dollar take I suggest you get out there and add to it because this film deserves to be #1 film of all time. I can't go right out there and say my favorite of all time yet but top five at the very least. Let's face it Titanic was your Grandma's movie...this one is for us. You are King of The World Mr. Cameron...the world and Pandora. 10/10 and then some<br/><br/>ADDITION---February 5th/2010 I had the pleasure of seeing Avatar for a second time and saw it in 3D. Was it impressive? Yes. The technology is very impressive and looks cool. Did it change the entire face of the movie? Sorry folks...it didn't for me. The movie is incredible but its incredible because its Avatar, not because of the 3D. I'm glad I saw it and it was on an IMAX screen so it was explosively cool but the movie is great on its own and gains very very little in 3D except a lot of depth.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>When his scientist brother dies, crippled marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) becomes his stand in for his extensive knowledge of his brother's plans. This puts him in the firing line of Dr.Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and her team, for his lack of scientific knowledge, as they try and mould a way for humans to enter the world of the Na'vi, the indigenous people of a planet that Col. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and businessman Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) want to conquer for personal gain. As Sully forms a close alliance with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) a female na'vi warrior and begins to be accepted by the rest of the clan, it becomes a battle between ethics and power, humanity and evil and a climactic battle to end it all.<br/><br/>James Cameron has to keep going and making the most expensive film ever made, what with Terminator 2, True Lies and, most recently (like, 1997 recently) Titanic...and now his latest, Avatar, stretching at just under three hours again, has gone and gained the accolade again as well as becoming the fastest grossing film of all time. Some people always have to do bigger and better, but the two don't go hand in hand that often. Luckily, as a filmic experience in itself, Avatar will stay memorable for a while.<br/><br/>Since the effects are the main thing that's making it, it has to be seen in 3D, which you will note has improved greatly over the years, to where it can still be seen perfectly without the 'special glasses.' But wearing them really does improve the experience, to where you really do feel yourself being sucked from your seat into the world of the film itself. But note, the effects are what make the film such an amazing, unforgettable experience. Surely enough, the massive hype has seen the film sprung up to number 46 on the IMDb top 250, which is low if you remember where The Dark Knight went, but I think people need to step back and see things more clearly. All I noticed aside from the effects were a lot of trite dialogue, thin characterization and long, meaningless stretches. Some have tried to make the film out to be some sort of study of the cruel, destructive nature of humans but I noticed nothing so dramatic driving the film. The performances hardly make things any better, Worthington interchangeable from his role in Terminator: Salvation and Lang and Ribisi rather cardboard villains. The female cast actually make it better, Saldana highly emotive as the na'vi warrior and Weaver impassioned as the scientist with a heart.<br/><br/>Yes, if you look beneath the surface there are a lot of weaknesses in the fundamentals of the film. But as a breath taking, special effects spectacle, Cameron has gone and done it again, giving us a blast of million dollar magic that are part of making a film such a wonderous experience. For this reason alone, it really cannot be missed on the big screen, in the best 3D screen you can find. ****</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I must admit the film had me at the very beginning, when a paraplegic says that he loves to dream because dreams make running and walking possible, my head keeps nodding as if it was mounted on springs. And the emotional outcome of that moment occurs when the Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) wakes up in his avatar's new skin and doesn't feel any weirdness, he's just so happy he starts to run as if he was in a dream, as if nothing mattered anymore, not even the mission. I loved that moment because it felt surreal yet so real, Sully wouldn't have cared about looking like Jar-Jar Binks if it made him feel his toes again. Youssa better believe it.<br/><br/>And this might be Cameron's way to tell us that even something as big as \"Avatar\" started as a tiny dream, and the first images with the hybrid Na'vis might have inspired him the same eccstatic reaction than Sully, his babies were alive, in synthetic images but alive nonetheless! Now, maybe it's because \"Avatar\" involves a giant alien species but the film is so cinematically \"big\" that it doesn't just dwarf other movies, it dwarfs any attempt to criticize it on the sole basis that the plot carries many déjà vu feelings. <br/><br/>You see me coming, but come on, who the hell am I to say, this movie is a retread of \"Pocahontas\", \"Dances With Wolves\" or \"Princess Mono-noke\"? James Cameron himself admitted to have made the story out of several inspiration and that included his childhood books and his mothers' dreams. Was \"Titanic\" any more original? Yet it made Cameron the king of the world. \"Avatar\" turned him into an undisputed Emperor and the film was so unique, inventive in the concept and innovative in the treatment that it flies over the critic.<br/><br/>That's not to say you can't criticize it but the amount of things worthy of praise is so overwhelming critics would be like complaining that the Sphinx misses a nose. So I guess I'd feel better if I gave \"Avatar\" ten points already and then talk about the eventual little things that-could-have-been-better. So let's go\n",
       " <br/><br/>I still remember how big \"Avatar\" was in 2009, the last film to be as big without belonging to the \"Star Wars\" franchise was \"Titanic\" so since this was from the same director, people knew they were going to be blown away before swallowing the first popcorn. And they were. Yes the film is marvelously looking\n",
       "  but it's CGI. I loved it as far as I can appreciate a good Pixar movie but reading Roger Ebert's reviews, I felt like he loved the film on the sole basis that it created a whole new world, and that it didn't matter that the film didn't break any narrative ground.<br/><br/>Now, does it matter? Not really, I also praised \"Titanic\" while it wasn't the most original story ever, but it had characters I cared for, and worthy antagonists. There was a moment in \"Avatar\" where the scientist played by Sigourney Weaver was describing the power of trees, the way they use their roots as a synapses and so on (which can be a rationalization for the trees' magical power in \"Pocahontas\"). This part had me intrigued and involved but then Ribisi's character had to ruin it by saying \"there are just goddamn trees\". I was baffled by his lack of empathy, it's just as if they wanted to supply his mouth with some villain's dialogue and the same awkward attempts were made with the Captain of the mission played by Stephen Lang.<br/><br/>Basically, you have the good natives, who behave exactly like extra-terrestrial natives and you have the good and the bad white and in the role of Lieutenant John Smith Dunbar, there's Worthington. The film recycled so many plots elements that it's difficult to disconnect your cliché-radar. But if the radar doesn't work, how about forgetting about the story and listening to the dialogue, the new language Cameron invented by pulling a Tolkien, watching the little details in the scenery, yes, yes CGI, but what CGI! We're not talking about any computer imagery, this is a vision that kept on Cameron's mind since before \"Titanic\" and he waited for the technological advances to make them possible. <br/><br/>Even the king of the world was disarmed but he wisely waited for the right time and it became the highest-grossing film of all time. Any good team of computer programmers could have done it, the film is a feast to the eyes, it's a deep story, but I was reminded that there were more than special effects to make a film, \"Avatar\" might not be a triumph of storytelling but it doesn't have a bad story to tell, its environmentalist issues, the way they foreshadow our future needs, echo some masterpieces from Miyazaki. In fact, I kept thinking of Mono-noke while watching the film, now is the film less worthy of praise because one was drawn? Let's say I prefer the way there's no villains in \"Mono-noke\" but to Cameron's defense, the film couldn't have had another third act. <br/><br/>And let's acknowledge the creative force behind the very concept of the avatar and the beauty of the Na'vis; Cameron created a world, a myth, he stole George Lucas' thunder and proved that cinema wouldn't just rely on \"Star Wars\" and then on comic-book movies. The man had guts, vision and the guts to follow his vision\n",
       "  and he also had the dough. You refuse nothing to the king of the world, but if all it took to make great movies was money, blockbusters would never flop. \"Avatar\" was deemed to succeed, because it was a game changer. And as far as critics go, the game is over.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">My impressions after having seen 'Avatar' are mixed.<br/><br/>On one hand I am the kind of film viewer who does not run away from entering the film theater and expecting a greater-than-life experience. I also love computer effects and any special effects that extend the cinema experience. From this point of view James Cameron's film is one of the best that I have seen, maybe second only to Peter Jackson's last film in the Lord of the Rings series in creating a whole new world of fascinating beauty, in imagining shapes, colors and visual emotions that did not exist before.<br/><br/>I also am a big science fiction fan, I love third degree encounters, and I let easily the small or tall, green or blue aliens move and frighten me. Yet, when judging a science fiction story or film I use the same criteria as when judging any other story or film - the capacity of entertaining, of creating emotion, and of making me think. Here I think 'Avatar' is no more than an average movie. Considered beyond the visuals it is no more than a quite banal action film, with stereotype characters (human or alien), with an anti-colonial message that is routine having seen it in scores of films from the Tarzan and John Wayne movies to the latest Iraq films, and with New Age incantations that never convinced me in any film ever.<br/><br/>The 3D genre is not so new. I have actually seen a 3D film festival in a cinematheque a decade ago, and it was made up mainly by action and science fiction films of the 50s. The technology was amazingly similar based on the two colors plastic spectacles. I find it remarkable that film makers took this technique out of the dusty drawers and made it enhance the other new film effects invented since. Films will however be judged by most people by the emotions they generate. My feelings after seeing 'Avatar' are that I viewed a fine visual show, but that it was deprived of originality and depth. Despite the 3D visuals a dimension was still missing.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It's worth noting at the start that, for nearly ten years, 'Avatar' was the highest grossing film of all time. Therefore, you may think that it HAS to be worth watching because so many people obviously did. Yes, it's certainly a technical achievement - writer/director James Cameron uses/refines every special effect trick in the book (and even invents a few new ones!) to bring us a science fiction tale about humanity trying to make peace with an alien race on a far away world, in order to get a rare mineral found only on this planet.<br/><br/>It's a decent enough tale, but I can't help think that its extraordinary performance at the Box Office was largely due to being the first film in the modern 3D age. The film is definitely 'live action,' but so many computer-generated special effects were required to create the giant blue aliens and their planet that half of it could practically be described as a bigger budget Pixar movie.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington is the star - a disabled space marine who gets a second lease of life (with legs) by inhabiting an 'avatar' which is basically a human-built version of the giant blue aliens. Once in control of this avatar, he can then mingle with the tribe and - hopefully - get them to trade their precious supply of 'unobtanium' (no, seriously - that's what they call this rare material!). Sigourney Weaver is about the biggest name on the cast list, but she seems to be playing a character who's a long way from her most famous on-screen incarnation, i.e. Ripley from 'Aliens.' Here, she wants to preserve the alien way of life rather than 'nuking the site from orbit!'<br/><br/>Although I never saw it in the cinema I heard it was definitely an impressive watch, simply because of the outstanding 3D and various effects. It's still worth a watch on the small screen, but, in terms of story, it really is nothing new. You can pretty much tell what's going to happen right from the off and everyone's character is quickly defined as either 'good' or 'bad.' Also, there's also very heavy 'political' messages not particularly skilfully woven into the story. The piece does get kind of preachy and it's strange that a writer as skilful as James Cameron can't find way of putting his own politics a little more subtly than what we end up with.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a sci-fi action film that won't tax your brain that much, you could certainly do much worse. There are great effects, action set-pieces and a story that's believable if you don't think too hard about it. I do always wonder why a film as successful as this never really seemed to linger much in popular culture. No one really talks about it much any more, leaving me to wonder whether it really was just the novelty of the 3D aspect that sold it to the masses. I guess we'll see when the sequels start rolling out?</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is the new feat of film-making. I would never have though James Cameron would have been able to pull this off, especially after all the hype. It's safe to say he did. While the plot is similar to other films, and despite many reviews saying that it's screenplay does not hold up to the weight of everything else in the film, I disagree. It's true that the screenplay is simple, but I found that is was a lot better than Titanic's screenplay, which really turned me off. But like most said, the screenplay is the least important aspect in this film, in a good way. It sets off this whole new vision that Cameron wants to bring to us. He does magnificently. The creature designs, visuals, sound, colors, and depth that everything has in Pandora is amazing, and I have never been transported into another world like I have with Avatar. Seeing it in 3-D was spectacular, simply spellbinding, and unforgettable. Everyone in the theater was in complete amazement at everything in this film, and for that, James Cameron has succeeded very well. He is a great director, and I hope he gets nominated for the Oscar at the very least. Avatar is the new feat of visual entertainment. It is one of the best films of 2009, and one of the best action films ever made.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">After more than a decade, James Cameron makes quite a returns with 'Avatar'. The idea of John Smith meeting Pocahontas at a moon is quite intriguing. Cameron's Pandora is fascinating to look at. The last time I saw a fictitious place this spectacular was in Hayao Miyzaki's spellbinding 'Mononoke Hime'.<br/><br/>The CGI designs, especially of the jungle and its inhabitants are intricately detailed and pleasantly colourful (even though the stop motion is still prominent). Needless to say, on the technical front, pretty much everything from action sequences, soundtrack, sound effects to cinematography are brilliant.<br/><br/>However, 'Avatar' isn't without its share of flaws especially where the writing is concerned. Considering that it's an epic film, a formulaic story is expected, with lots of battle sequences, romance etc but Cameron introduces certain themes but he doesn't really go anywhere with them. An example is Grace's theory about the trees communicating through synapses like the human brain (or perhaps Cameron left this open for a possible sequel?). Moreover, there are a few plot holes. How come all the animals (with the exception of the horselike creatures) are predators? How come the Na'Vi speak such good English? The acting is fairly good. However, Sam Worthington's performance isn't exactly flawless. His acting is flat in a few sequences but in other he manages to make it work. Giovanni Ribisi's villain is formulaic but it's refreshing to see him do something different for a change and he does it well. Zoe Saldana is impressive as Pocahontas, I mean, Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez are first rate.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Avatar' is visually pleasing and entertaining. As flawed as it may be, it's a much more exhilarating film than Cameron's horrendous candyfloss called 'Titanic</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This movie was better than I expected because I thought the story would be horrible. And it wasn't; actually, it's a story that has been used many times. It sort of reminded me of General Custard at Little Big Horn. The bad humans are tired of trying to make nice with the blue aliens and so decide to destroy them. Aliens with their less advanced weapons unite and defeat the bad humans from completely overtaking their world.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver, plays Grace, a scientist that wants to learn from the Navi and believes that they are one with the forest. Enter, Jake, a marine whom is replacing his deceased brother, as a driver of an Avatar, which is the human/alien/ body that can be controlled by the human's mind. Jake gets lost and is taken in by the Navi, in particular a girl, Neytiri. They teach him the way of life. He is supposed to gain their trust and ask them to leave their land so the humans can harvest this valuable rock that is there.<br/><br/>OF course, Jake falls for the girl and wants to help them defend their land against the evil chief of security whom takes over and wants to destroy everything.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It's your typical story that everyone likes, plus cool special effects. It is a little long, but that's why I say watch it at home so you can stop it several times.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This has to be the best movie ever made! I made sure to get tickets for the 3D version on the very first day the movie came out. My friends and I were first in line at the cinema. Also, I got this on DVD the day it came out. James Cameron is a very good director and the master of breakthrough cinema.<br/><br/>This is basically about a conflict between humans and a population on a different planet named the Na'vi. The humans want a special mineral named \"Unobtainium\" but the Na'vi species live over the minerals. So the humans want to take the minerals by force. But there's a certain human named Jake Sully....<br/><br/>The acting is very good.It's always good to see Signourey Weaver back in a James Cameron movie. I have been impressed with Sam Worthington over the past year with his roles.<br/><br/>There are two minor weak points. First, the story is a little weak but who cares. Second, the cries of the blue Na'vi people sound very weird.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent movie. I'm glad this is the number one movie of all time. I rate this movie 10/10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">12 years ago, James Cameron had a vision of Avatar in mind. A vision so ahead of its time that Cameron shelved his project in order to wait for the technology to catch up. A vision so imaginative &amp; exciting that he, finally, went on to create the much needed technology on his own. And the end result was NOT disappointing at all. Avatar takes film-making technology to a whole new level &amp; sets a new standard in 3D viewing. It's a milestone in the history of the art.<br/><br/>Avatar tells the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission who becomes torn between following his orders &amp; protecting the world he feels is his home. Avatar is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism &amp; biodiversity. Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. So, watch it in 3D cinemas only if you really want to experience the breathtaking vision of Cameron's world.<br/><br/>Director James Cameron has, once again, broken all boundaries &amp; created a visual extravaganza, thus, in the process, announcing his return which just couldn't have been better. From Terminator to Aliens to The Abyss to Terminator 2 to Titanic &amp; now Avatar, the entertainment scope is getting wider &amp; wider with every Cameron's film without compromising at all with the quality. The attention he has given to the detail is superb. Not only Cameron created a whole new world with its flora &amp; fauna of exceptional beauty, he went on to create the culture, race &amp; language of the Na'vi too &amp; their love for their surroundings. They are to Pandora what humans are to Earth. Only difference being our ignorance to our surroundings.<br/><br/>Avatar isn't an exceptional movie, overall. When it comes to plot, performances or dialogs, its a disappointment. Those things are no match to Cameron's previous works; Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2 &amp; even Titanic. The reason behind Avatar breaking every box-office records lies in the beauty of Avatar that's drawing people to theaters again &amp; again. The unforgettable experience in 3D viewing, the dead-end beauty of Pandora, the never-seen-before film-making technology &amp; much satisfying entertainment overall are all responsible for its grand success. It has started the change. It has set things in motion. Cinema is getting revolutionized. Almost every movie is going 3D these days because of Avatar. Still, none have been able to recreate that same magic or experience. That's why, Avatar is way ahead of it's time.<br/><br/>Now, let's come to the strong points of Avatar. It lies in its visual effects, editing &amp; cinematography. Editing, like any Cameron movie, is brilliant. The cinematography brings us closer to the beautiful environment, the exotic creatures &amp; incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora. Those who watched it in 3D knows how heartwarming the feeling was to find yourself in the flora &amp; fauna of Pandora. However, the backbone of Avatar is its visual effects. Groundbreaking from scene 1, it's not the surroundings but the details of the surroundings because of which Visual Effects of Avatar reached new heights. World's 2 greatest visual effects studios, ILM &amp; Weta Digital, worked together to produce this gem, and the results are wonderful. The attention in detailing &amp; the magnitude scale of Pandora are sure to leave viewers jaw-dropped. Just the detailing on the face of a Na'vi is enough to tell you about the dedication involved in its making.<br/><br/>Technically, Avatar is a breakthrough in film-making technology, 3D viewing &amp; stereoscopic film-making with camera being designed specifically for the movie. If one looks at the story, it isn't that bad too. Of course not the best or even among the best, but still, it has all elements of entertaining the general audience of the world &amp; that's what this movie is doing right now. At least, James Cameron knows how to invest and properly use the massive budget of this movie, unlike Michael Bay(Transformers 1 n 2) or Roland Emmerich(2012, Godzilla etc) who rely only on VFX &amp; nothing else. At least, Avatar scores pretty well above them. It tells a fine story &amp; let VFX n SFX take this movie to new heights.<br/><br/>James Horner collaborated with James Cameron for the 3rd time (after Titanic &amp; Aliens) &amp; no doubt, has given a brilliant soundtrack yet again. The score is not as epic as Titanic but is still excellent for a sci-fi film. The score is really beautiful &amp; succeeds in creating the music culture for the alien race. The beauty of the music of Avatar blends well with the beauty of Pandora. James Horner has done a fantastic job.<br/><br/>Also, the story or screenplay of Avatar won't make it to the great lists. So, its better you go without expecting a quality plot &amp; screenplay from this movie but a feast for the eyes. And make sure you watch Avatar in 3D for an all new experience. You won't regret it. Missing Avatar would be like missing a turning point in cinema. So be a part of it.<br/><br/>10/10 for Avatar's beauty &amp; the wonderful experience I had in theater.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie features a guy named Jake using another body to become a species of alien called the Navi to help colonize a Moon. He turns against the people who order its destruction. This was the highest grossing movie in the world up until \"Avengers: Endgame\", although in the United States, it was first surpassed by \"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens\". It's easily the highest grossing film that's based on a completely original story. Most people only remember the visuals.<br/><br/>The film has gotten some criticism for not being original, with the story being done in films like \"Pocahontas\" and dare I say \"District 9\"? I really do get the relationship between Jake and his mate. I admit that the general villain is very bland. Sigourney Weaver might be the best actor/actress, maybe because it's time she dealt with less hostile aliens. We of course get amazing visuals and it's silly to complain about the military being defeated, because they had a whole moon's worth of natives to help and the spirit of nature itself. It's long, but the setup is done at a great pace. ***1/2.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I don't think that I'll like Avatar that much if I see it again and it's not in 3-D. The visual experience was fun, but I really had no strong emotional connection to the characters or the story (or the trees, for that matter). The special effects are great, but beyond that it is just a cookie-cutter plot.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">As a prolific reviewer here, I have on many occasions encountered what I call \"first release shock.\" Essentially a film so off-the-beaten-path, so unique, so different that, instead of appreciating it for what it is, initial viewers go into a sort of shock and become numb to what they are watching.<br/><br/>This film is the poster child for that syndrome. On its own, it is one of the most daring, best written, best acted, best SFX'd, films of all time. It comes from a man (Cameron) who is known for blockbusters, but this is easily his greatest work.<br/><br/>This film should rate a perfect score regardless of the rating system. But as explained above initial viewers did not know what to make of it. And the cost of the film became an issue for the studio when the numbers failed to meet expectations.<br/><br/>It is not the job of the reviewer to worry about studio receipts. The job of the reviewer is identify brilliance and recommend it. See it six or seven times, it just gets better. One of the greatest films of all time and also timeless.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar (2009)<br/><br/>Technically dizzying, morally unambiguous, with dialog and a story line aimed at teens and young adults, but clearly with wider appeal. Set a hundred and some years in the future, the helicopters landing still conjure up Vietnam, and some of the big mean soldier stuff drinking coffee in the middle of battle, with the airships rolling in over the population below, is pure Apocalypse Now. It's a \"big\" movie, and visually demanding. <br/><br/>The 3-D is terrific, smoother and more restrained than other 3-D releases (Journey to the Center of the Earth), which gives it sophistication beyond just the gimmick. I watched part of if without the glasses, and it's actually still pretty jazzy, so I think it would work in 2-D very well, if that's what you have in your area (or in your budget--they charge extra for the extra dimension). The music is heart pumping stuff, formulaic for sure, but part of the adrenalin machine.<br/><br/>Is this a \"good\" movie? Not really. It's an impressive movie, obviously, but it has a hyped up computer gaming feel to it, not only visually but ethically, and in terms of depth of plot. It does have a science fiction fascination to it, with the mind and soul switching bodies in different ways, though I'm not totally sure it makes logical sense, which even sci-fi has to do. And the clichés are fun in their own ways, even if I got tired of it all the constant running and fear, the endless platitudes, the constantly pretty prettiness (it's one heck of a beautiful planet, Pandora is). Even more of a problem is the stereotyping going on, culturally, from the natives to the military, but I'll save getting angry for another day. If you notice it, it's demeaning, if you don't, watch it again.<br/><br/>These aren't all things to hate, but the movie doesn't have a lot to love, nothing to dig into, nothing to think about, nothing to make you feel deeply. It might make you feel in a more sympathetic way--there is room for a lot of sympathy, and if your heart strings are dangling beware--but it will do so in the way the Lion King or Pocahontas did. Someone said to me, hearing my doubts, \"You expect too much.\" And that makes me think, \"Really?\" I'd hate to ever say that about a movie this ambitious, even from a James Cameron who already proved his crowd pleasing intentions, and savvy, with Titanic. Expectations aside, I want more, and you might, too.<br/><br/>I added this response to the New York Times blog, after a comment by their reviewer Manohla Dargis: <br/><br/>Well, yes, it's sort of given that we all carry our baggage with us, and apply our viewpoints with bias, one way or the other. But Dargis is too willing to just say, \"Whatever,\" as if the movie didn't have some specific narrative and symbolic qualities that can be scrutinized. That is, even if viewers come away from the movie with a diversity of views (hopefully they do), it is still true that the main character is a white male (with a disability). Or that there are almost no African representations among the humans, and few women (two, mainly, and they both die). Or that there is a kind of broad stereotyping of the natives in attitude and appearance (widely open to interpretation, but not a blank slate). Or that the invading traitor ends up being, voila, the leader of this hapless tribal people with very high ideals. Etc. Etc. If it sounds like I'm suggesting a way to read the movie, it's not on purpose. That's the baggage thing, and I have mine. But it doesn't mean that we should all just turn a blind eye to the possibilities, without polarizing the argument, and without making the movie more than it is, a dizzying entertainment a step away from some Disney classics. With all their stereotyping.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the future, humans have traveled to the far reaches of the universe. On a planet called Pandora, a very important new element was discovered, one that is very valuable. But, wouldn't you know, the natives on the planet live in the forest, where most of the element is located, underground. It is the human intention to \"displace\" the natives out of their woods and get to the mineral. For years, the Americans have occupied an outpost on the planet and have tried peaceful methods to reason with the aliens. The top scientist, Grace (Sigourney Weaver) learned their language and opened a \"school\" to teach the native children English and the ways of the human. But, the Pandoran population truly wants none of it, for they rightly feel that their world will be destroyed. Although they have only bows and arrows, with a killing poison attached, they are very fierce. As a last resort, the Marines are trying a program of elaborate \"robots\", where an earthling goes into a sort of capsule and sleeps while his \"soul\" inhabits a native body. It is their hope that learning the ways of the natives will make them easier to \"conquer\" and move. Now, a wheelchair-bound Marine named Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) gets a new, Pandoran body and goes with Grace and a few others on a mission. But, due to some fierce dinosaur-like creatures, Jake becomes separated from the others and is left in the forest at night. Grace believes he will surely die. He would have, too, for a powerful female warrior, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) was set to shoot him. But, some seeds from their \"tree of life\" cover Jake and Neytiri sees it as an omen. She takes Jake back to her village where he is eventually accepted as a tribesman. He learns to ride the native \"horses\" and \"dragons\". He and Neytiri also fall in love. But, during the night, Jake \"reports\" back to the Marines when his native body is asleep. The marine commander believes he is gathering information to defeat the primitive folk. As one might guess, Jake soon realizes his new people are very worthy and should not be destroyed or moved, for their life is \"connected\" deeply to the forest, their home. What will Jake do to save Neytiri and his new brothers and sisters? This is an amazing film, a stunningly visual panorama that has to be seen to be believed. The planet of Pandora is a forest like no other, with plants that \"glow\" and creatures that resemble dinosaurs, wolves, and dragons. The natives, too, resemble the American Indian and other earthly tribes, such as the residents of the Amazon rain forests. Most importantly, they are \"attached\" to their planet as the Native Americans were to the earth. When they kill an animal for food, they utter prayers to the animal for giving his life so that they might be sustained. They consider the destruction of any plant a blow to their own bodies. Thus, in many respects, the movie is a gigantic homage to the American Indian and their way of life. Wes Studi, who was the ultra frightening Native American in The Last of the Mohicans, even plays the Pandoran leader. But, enough of this. The actors, including Worthington, Weaver, Saldana, Ribisi, Stephen Lang and all of the rest do a fine job. The dialogue and story are, perhaps, not totally original but quite, quite adequate. However, even all these take a back seat to the incredibly imaginative scope of the film's setting, a new world far away. It is the grand scale of the forested planet that will take a viewer's breath away. In short, dear film fan, see it. Absolutely, if you can go to only ONE film this year or next, make it AVATAR. It is truly a jaw-dropping work that will overwhelm most anyone with its visionary beauty.</div>,\n",

In these two years, nothing, nothing in this world came even in a mile to \"Avatar's\" experience (and i'm a real fan of \"Inception\"). James Cameron is my favorite director since his \"Aliens\". I simply love every single movie (except the one with flying fishes - killers) he made. I'm waited for \"Avatar\" from the moment i first heard about J.Cameron making his new \"groundbreaking\" movie since \"Titanic\", it was in 2004. <br/><br/>In December of 2009 \"Avatar\" blew out everything. Never in my life i didn't saw anything like that before (and i saw almost everything) :) In local 3D theater in was impossible to have a ticket. Everyone talked only about this experience in theaters.<br/><br/>Recently i revisited Pandora on Blu Ray on my 2,2 m x 2 m HD screen - it's a breathtaking ride.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is just an over hyped, overrated movie that put me to sleep.<br/><br/>During the hype before watching this I expected to see something great. I didn't. The movie was so boring and so long. It was a long boring movie.<br/><br/>It's no wonder why the sequel or prequel has been delayed because the producers were probably bored with it and didn't expect fans to actually like such a boring movie.\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar<br/><br/>Throughout history, explorers colonizing foreign shores usually brought items of interest with them to trade with the indigenous people – be it guns for tobacco, alcohol for pelts or Christianity for personal freedom. However, the only thing that the subjugated populace in this sci-fi film received upon the arrival of their oppressors was annihilation.<br/><br/>When paraplegic marine Jake (Sam Worthington) substitutes for his twin brother on a mission to the planet Pandora, his legs are restored when his mind's transferred into an avatar of a Na'vi – a blue-skinned native.<br/><br/>Ordered to infiltrate the hostiles' camp and relay information concerning a massive mineral deposit, things go awry when Jake falls for the tribe leader's daughter Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), as well as her primitive lifestyle. Torn between military obligations and personal ethics, Jake must pick a side in the war between the persecutors and the persecuted.<br/><br/>Conceived by James Cameron, Avatar is a mind-blowing experience. And while the story of \"going native\" is old hat, the eco-friendly premise and the CGI used to bring the jungle surroundings to life are unparalleled.<br/><br/>But in the end, who's to say if the Na'vi wouldn't benefit under imperialism? – I mean, have they ever even heard of American Apparel?

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">20 December 2009. The technology is almost here and Avatar and director Cameron has \"almost\" created the perfect vehicle for the future of film (minus the real actors). This American-focused, popularized and simplified version of the block-buster sci-fi movie appears to the fusion of various popular movies plus super CGI. This movie is essentially \"Dances with Wolves\" (1990) with an American ending put into space along with a \"Aliens\" (1986) military background/corporate scenario, \"Robocop\" (1987), \"Star Troopers (1997), Jurrasic Park III (2001) along with fantasy series \"Dragonriders of Pern\" written by Anne McCaffery (1988) with musical strains from \"Enemy at the Gates\" (2001). What this spectacularly looking movie misses is the consistency of cultural immersion found in \"Dances with Wolves\" especially the native language and the inconsistent adoption by lead character Jake Sully of its language and its holistic mind-set, Cameron allows the Americanization and over-simplification of the politically correct presentation of American evilness. There is one scene midway where Jake is able to meld with one of the local inhabitants and then says incorrectly \"You're mine\" as opposed to \"we're together now\" which would have been much more in line with the native perspective of living things. There were also a few technical weaknesses consisting of 2154 machine guns which one would have assumed would have advanced in over a hundred years and the climatic action scene were supposedly bullet (still using them) proof glass conveniently breaks when it comes to the enemy's troop carriers. Overall, however, this is a break-through movie that immerses the audience into another world almost seamlessly. The level of technology and special effects almost, almost is imperceptible to live action. Yet, it is the small details that seem to deflect this movie from becoming truly a classic movie. 8/10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The female lead Neytiri (Voiced and Motion Capture by actress Zoe Saldana) was kinda right. The world that director James Cameron made was definitely worth seeing at the time. The mixing of live action with photo realistic CGI really work so well with very few fake looking scenes. The vibrant planet with its motion capture blue skinned Na'vi characters were quite beautiful and breathtaking with its floating mountains, wing creatures and neon glowing plant life. Nevertheless, the main story about a human soldier Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) torn between his military orders to find a rare natural resource and his love for the native people didn't live up to the eye candy visuals. The main plot didn't feel that unique. It was too similar to clichés from Best Picture 1990 Oscar Winner film 'Dances with Wolves' mixed with Disney 1995 animation movie 'Pocahontas' with bits from 1992 'FernGully: The Last Rainforest' cartoon motion picture. To add onto that, the whole earth mother indigenous people allegory message felt a little too heavy handed and preachy for a popcorn escapism film. It really does make you feel the blues about trying to enjoy yourself for only a few hours. That film's message is also somewhat hypocritical in a way as the flick was later oversaturation with a large amount of consumerist tie ins. After all, they did clear 12 acres of swamp land to build a theme park attraction based on this movie due to greed. That's a lot of home trees. Certainly not conservationism actions at all from somebody that once stop the construction of a proposed dam in Brazil. Also, the whole idea of Deus ex Machina Eywa coming alive in the end for Jake Sully felt a little forced; seeing how he isn't originally from their world. It's like saying a well-funded New Age hippie from the city is more in line with mother nature rather than the Native Americans that lived there. It's kinda an insult. It's also weird that he was chosen over Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) whom spent her own life trying to protect the Navi. Regardless I did dig the whole operation of walking in somebody shoes with the genetically engineered body subplot. It reminds me so much of the avatars of the blue deities in Hinduism and their belief of reincarnation. Because of that, we really got to learn the tribe's culture, but also with that, the awkwardly somewhat disturbing alien hair like Kama sutra bonding scene with other creatures. Nevertheless, all the exploration of the Navi didn't work to expose much of the individuals of the clan personalities. Besides Neytiri, I hardly remember any of those characters. Nobody stood out from their overall stereotypical noble savage ways. As for the human characters. Sam is alright in the role even if his character's paraplegic subplot doesn't add much. He was a bit cookie cutter. Yet it's Stephen Lang as Colonel Quaritch &amp; Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge as the over the top villains that really stood out for me. Lots of well delivered memorable lines from these two actors even if their dialogue was a bit cheesy. I especially love the action scenes involving the Colonel. The 'mask on' shoot out and the nonchalantly way he puts himself out after catching on fire was certainly badass. While a lot of people are saying that the film is pushing an anti-American militarism message with its imperialism depictions of the space marine. The main different is in real life, the groups responsible for committing the most war crimes against humanity are not the American occupying soldiers, but those extremists domestic to the area especially in what happening in Afghanistan and Iraq. Still I do see some similarities what happening in the film with the search for unobtainium what happening in our world with oil along with the phrase 'winning the hearts and minds'. Regardless of that, the music composed by James Horner and singer Leona Lewis does take you out of the real world into one full of adventure and wonder. Yet the sound effects for this movie doesn't sound otherworldly. Much of the noises for the creatures in this film does seem recycled from other blockbuster flicks like 1993 'Jurassic Park'. It's a bit annoying. As for the humanoid aliens, sounds like a car alarm don't really give off the idea that they're living beings. Just saying. In the end, this flick became one of the highest grossing films of all time, surpassing Cameron's previous movie 1997 'Titanic' until finally beaten by the Russo Brothers comic book masterpiece 'Avengers: Endgame' ten years later. Much of this was aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings. Because of that success, studios became to request post production conversion into 3D for some of their films, although the success rate widely varied such in the case of the once titled 'Avatar', 2010 'The Last Airbender' that was universally panned by critics for how bad the flick's visuals was upon its release. In the end, very little post 3D films have match Cameron's success at the box office. Another thing 'Avatar' did good at was the home market release. It pretty much help save Blu-Ray in the high definition optical disc format war. The flick also scored a number of accolades with most of the wins involving the technology aspect of the film. The movie had so much success and praise that it's been reported that there will be sequels in the works being filmed back to back. It will be interesting where they take the story from here whenever those flicks come out. Overall: Once in a blue moon a film come out that everybody has to see. This is that movie. It's an epic watch. One worth waking up to.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the future, a paraplegic marine's avatar (a goofy blue-skinned cartoon-like incarnation of himself that he controls while sleeping) is sent on a mission to mingle with the natives of a distant planet. The pictures are pretty but the story is a lame rehash of a theme that has been done much better before. The movie becomes increasingly tedious as it lumbers along for nearly three hours. Cameron is not so much interested in making a compelling movie as in flaunting his prowess with special effects. Weaver's presence only serves to remind one of how good a sci-fi film can be (\"Alien\"). This nonsensical movie plays out like a dull computer game.</div>,\n",

The grand scale of the entire production is simply mind blowing. The effects are unlike anything we've ever seen and is quite mesmerizing, actually. Action, adventure, humor, drama, exhilarating action sequences and a world full of magic and color ensure entertainment deluxe. Add a brilliant cast and a credible hero in the form of Sam Worthington and I can easily see why this film became the highest earning film in movie history. The tranquility of the Avatar world gives us a sense of escapism and makes us wish we ourselves could plunge into this world of pure bliss and perfection. Our hero goes from paraplegic in the real world to a perfect being in the Avatar world, so why wouldn't we also want to escape into this awesome world?<br/><br/>The destruction of the Big Tree must be one of the most awesome scenes!!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This film was a true epic of its time. It is definitely not very original in its storyline but it was so well executed that I was engrossed all the way through, emotionally enraptured and always rooting for the characters. Other than the beginning, you never notice how much time has passed. It is visually wonderful although it relies on this a bit too much at the expense of the story. The storyline and characters are a bit clichéd but it was just so engaging I didn't care.</div>,\n",

       " .but it does seem that visual is the only thing in Avatar, given a plot that is simplicity itself and the un-subtlety of the allegory and messages. Even with the credible performance of a good cast, I find the overwhelming reaction (audience and critics alike) somewhat puzzling. Roger Ebert's comparison of the \"new language\" to that in LOTR, in addition to demonstrating the gentleman's total ignorance, tantamount to an unforgivable insult to J.R.R. Tolkien.<br/><br/>First, on the visual, after watching \"Beowulf\" (2007), I was filled with absolute detestation at an abomination called \"motion capture\". The outright rude transformation of an actor's real performance into an animation on screen is a technology-spawn sin that is surpassed by only one thing in human history – the atomic bomb. The obscenely glossy figures in that movie were positively vomit-inducing. That alone almost kept me away from Avatar. I am happy to say, however, that the motion captured characters therein are quite acceptable, partly because Cameron commands a better technology and partly because the motion captured characters are from an alien culture and therefore not expected to look exactly like the human race. The 3D effect, on the other hand, is no more than an excuse to make me pay double for my ticket. Having seen what REAL 3D is supposed to be like, some 30 years ago, at the EPCOT when it first opened, I have found everything that I've seen since with that label nothing more then mere child's play. Avatar is no exception.<br/><br/>The sci-fi basis for this movie is conceptually simple, especially if you have seen \"Surrogate\" (2008). When a protagonist is put into a state of deep sleep in a not-too-sophisticated-looking device, his mind embodies a surrogate body, going about whatever business at hand. The only difference is that here in Avatar, the surrogate body is from an alien culture resembling, in appearance, human in some ways but not others. What follows are familiar plot elements: assimilation of an individual into a new culture, a cross-culture love story, heroic uprising against oppressors.<br/><br/>The cast is well chosen and performs well. Sam Worthington coming off \"Terminator Salvation\" (2009) plays a relatively younger hero, especially in his alien persona, one of his two roles. Unlike Worthington, Zoe Saldana his female co-lead has only one identity, the passionate daughter of the alien chief. Those who have seen how beautiful she was in \"Vantage point\" (2008) will be happy to know that even under the entirely alien appearance, her beauty is not lost. Sigourney Weaver (who happens to have also appeared in \"Vantage point\") is a welcome addition to any cast. Personally, I am most happy to see my favourite Giovanni Ribisi, prolific actor and best remembered acting opposite Cate Blanchett in \"Heaven\" (2002). He plays a scientist rudely awaken to the reality that science is not the only thing, not just an end in itself. Stephen Land and Michelle Rodriguez complete the very respectable cast.<br/><br/>Avatar is a good movie, but not a great one.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Having just seen \"Avatar\", I wanted to report the experience as it relates to entertainment, rather than just expounding upon the \"wow\" factor. There is no question that the special 3D effects are spectacular. Most movies make the story the primary form of entertainment, with special effects taking a secondary role. With \"Avatar\", this sequence is completely reversed, as the 3D effects overwhelm the simplistic story. This brings me to the most glaring flaw with \"Avatar\". If the storyline is deep and involving, there is little problem with a film running 100 minutes or even a little longer. Unfortunately, \"Avatar\" at 162 minutes becomes redundant and ultimately somewhat disappointing, because as wonderful as the effects are they cannot maintain interest for such an unrealistic time frame. - MERK</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">When \"Avatar\" first hit the theaters back in early December of 2009, I really didn't have an overwhelming urge to see it, as I'm usually very skeptical of films that base their hype on CGI- based graphics (as they usually overshadow such important elements as plot and character development). However, with the film surpassing Titanic as #1 all-time in box office revenues, I figured I would give it a shot, thinking maybe I really was missing out on something special. Unfortunately, the film did much, much worse, as I left the theater wondering how such a shallow movie could now be on top of the heap.<br/><br/>The number one flaw in the film is one that it truly cannot recover from in any other aspect: a terribly shallow plot. If you have seen Pocahontas (white man must learn the ways of the natives) or Dances With Wolves (disgruntled military officer sympathizes with former enemy), you have seen Avatar. There really is nothing else.<br/><br/>Adding to that fatal flaw is the high-handed directing of James Cameron. While some great directors (Clint Eastwood immediately comes to mind here) will present an interesting palette of characters and let the viewers decide what they may about them, Cameron instead chooses to be rigid in his character definition. For example, the military is evil, scientists are greedy, and all natives are perfect in their commune with nature. If you have your head in the clouds, then perhaps those kinds of moralist viewpoints will appeal to you. For the rest of us, it is quite sickening. Basically, it turns into 162 minutes of Cameron slapping you across the face with his environmental/naturalist themes.<br/><br/>Thus, as far as character development is concerned, it practically does not exist. Besides the utterly predictable transformation of the \"one good white man\" and his assimilation into the native culture, no other background is explored on any character. I am fully confident that any decent writer could sit down and, within a day, put together a much more interesting backstory on certain aspects of the film (military, scientists, etc.) that would actually make the conflicts of the film compelling, other than the bleeding-heart sap it turned out to be.<br/><br/>Plus, and this is truly the coupe-de-grace of failure, the CGI produces some great images, but unless you are a complete tech-head, it isn't really anything to fawn over. For example, the sinking of the Titanic in Cameron's other big film was just as eye-popping as anything that Avatar put up on the screen.<br/><br/>To be honest, it really makes me shake my head that a movie like this can not only succeed in this country, but do so in record capacity. Have we really become so thoughtless and simple to reduce humanity to such black-and-white constructs? I'm sure that the Academy Award voters will have a field day with such themes and turn the ceremony into Cameron's own private ego- massaging, but I for one do not see it that way. If you are looking for a great director who will really make you think about humanity, try the later films of Clint Eastwood.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I am not going to insist on the technical prowess and creativity of this film. The special effects, both visual and sound, are superb, sublime, perfect, the merger of Star Wars and Matrix, of all the best means ever devised to make our eyes and ears believe the unbelievable. James Cameron is a god of sorts in that field and he used the most advanced studios to produce a divine and magical fairy tale. Anyone who pretends to love the cinema cannot and must not ever be reluctant in the slightest way to go and watch that film, two or three times if possible. And James Cameron is just as good when he deals with the surreal and supernatural of this extra-terrestrial civilization and when he exposes the brutality and human underdevelopment with no hope to ever be emerging from their dumbness of both military higher-ups and greedy industrialists. To list and explain all the allusions to all the films you can and will recognize would need two hundred pages. So I will pass and trust your own knowledge to enjoy the many allusions. I want to insist on the central message of the film, both ideological and cultural. Americans arriving on this planet finds a humanoid species, both intelligent and developed, but in a direction that has kept and exploited the direct relation that every individual can entertain with the beasts of nature and the telluric or subterranean forces of nature seen as the mother of the equilibrium without which nothing can survive. The only aim of the Americans is to recuperate some ore that is in great quantities under the main home-tree of this species, under all the sacred places and natural temples of this civilization, and to use brutal force if necessary to clear the area. Greed and death instinct are the two teats on which all these Americans have been fed. Genetic science makes it possible to invest the personality of a human into the genetically modified cloned body of a local humanoid, producing a spy who is to get into this community and bring back the information necessary for the military genocide while his human body is kept in some hibernating pod. The problem with that project is that the happy few who can thus get into that community fall in love with their civilization, their culture, their deep human feelings and their absolute cult of prowess, courage and intelligence invested in the full respect of mother nature. Eventually for one of them that love will mean falling in love with the daughter of the political (father) and religious (mother) leaders of the tribe. James Cameron is a genius in the way he depicts the strong human emotions on the American side, both negative and positive and this depicting is immediately effective on us who are well trained in reading, receiving and experiencing these emotions. We feel the full horror James Cameron wants us to feel in front of the ugly conquistador colonel and the admirable courage of this female marine who prefers betraying her camp to being part of a planned genocide. James Cameron tries hard to depict in the same way the extra-terrestrial feeling and emotions of these humanoids, both real and cloned, but there we feel them less because they are different and we are not in phase with them, especially since the special effects are making us slightly blind. But it remains absolutely sublime. The meaning here is that of the meeting of two human species and their divided objectives on both sides. It is the merging of the two species in order to produce collaboration, cooperation, exchange and even total gift of culture, technological power, natural knowledge, spiritual representations, and all other common or different domains. In other words we are dealing with the fascination of the other. Some call that inverted racism or mixing cultures, salad bowl or melting pot, integration or assimilation. But James Cameron shows us how that approach is dangerous and fatal for the weaker species who will always be the victim of the stronger species, understood as being the Americans who have no word of honor when greed is in play. At the same time if we do not respect the other in its total personality, religion and religious beliefs included, we will only produce a genocide, be it at least a cultural genocide teaching English and imposing our culture, and negating the natural evolution of the differentiation of languages, the punishment of the tower of Babel in our religious lore. James Cameron is telling us a parable more than a fable, and he is in perfect line with the deepest Judeo-Christian tradition of ours, of the Christ who was rabbi Jesus before being crucified. That deepest belief of ours is called love: to love the other in his or her difference and to give to that other all we have and share it with him or her, expecting the same attitude on the other side but at the same time refusing violence in the other case and loving our \"enemies\" as much as our \"friends\". In other words, and to cut short a long story, this film is the First Gospel after Barack Hussein Obama's election, even if that new spiritual approach of the world did not produce a miracle in Copenhagen. The Second Gospel of this Obama era will be the announced film by Steven Spielberg on the last novel by Stephen King, Under the Dome. After Saint James, the first Bishop of Jerusalem and the elder brother of Jesus in the end stoned to death at the foot of the wall of Jerusalem, we will have Saint Stephen, the Protomartyr of Christianity, stoned to death on the encouragement of Saul of Tarsus, the future Paul.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I confess that this film never really caught my eye until I read about it. I still remember when it was in theaters more than ten years ago. More recently, I decided to see it. The film was a success, as we all know, and I find it surprising that I didn't have the right to any sequels.<br/><br/>The script takes place in a distant future, when humans have ruined the Earth but are colonizing and exploring other planets like Pandora, where Jake Sully, a veteran of the Marines, is going after being recruited by a scientific program. Pandora has a rare and valuable ore that humans want, but it also allows the planet to have an exuberant and unusual biological life. It happens to be inhabited by natives called Naavi (who look like huge blue humans with a long tail), and they are determined to protect their world from the greed of the Terran's. Sully joins the Avatar Program, which allows him to remotely control the body of a Naavi. If the program allows humans to live and learn from them (as its director, scientist Dr. Grace, wants), it also turns them into Trojan horses (as Colonel Miles, commander of the military forces in Pandora, wishes). This will put Sully in a conflict of loyalties while allowing him to see how the natives are connected to their world and are inseparable from it.<br/><br/>The plot raises a number of pertinent questions. We can, for example, reflect on the way we have lived and managed our planet, on the superiority with which we see who is different from us, on how we despise the environment or deliberately harm it by greed, on our passion for war instead of peaceful conflict resolution or even about how technological and medical advances do not reach everyone and are put at the service of some wealthy people instead of being available to all. It is a script that makes you think and could be seen in many ways. Unfortunately, the story built on these premises is not so good. There is good material and the way Sully is divided in his loyalty as he lives with the natives is the backbone of the whole thing, but everything else is quite predictable and one-dimensional, and sometimes it sounds bad: humans are treated in a simplistic way and turned into despicable creatures, while the Naavi are idealized to the fullest. The old story of \"good guys and bad guys\".<br/><br/>Sam Worthington shows all his talent in a demanding and likeable character. He plays well with Zoe Saldaña, his alien romantic couple. The actress is excellent and was having a good time in her career then. I also liked the work of Sigourney Weaver, in the role of a strong, bossy and grumpy scientist, who is guided by her ideals even if it means facing the military. But the best of the cast ends here. The rest are reduced to one-dimensional and stupid characters, as is the case with Stephen Lang (the \"brute like the stones\" colonel who only thinks about his mission), Michelle Rodríguez (the military hot girl who decides to collaborate with the \"goodies\" instead of helping the \"baddies\"), Giovanni Ribisi (one of the\" baddies\"), Joel David Moore (one of the\" goodies\"), Laz Alonso, CCH Pounder, Wes Studi (the \"perfect ones\") etc. This was somewhat disappointing in a film with so many qualities and such a high budget.<br/><br/>It is in the technical aspects that this film excels. Directed by James Cameron, an avid fan of the green screen and a \"rival\" of Spielberg, it's a film that was built on top of an entire digital world. Thanks to this feature, Cameron can become a god for a minute and create a new universe with plants and animals that we have never seen and that exude beauty. The film has a spectacular cinematography and it does not pass five minutes without, in some way, making us hold our breath before such a show of color and light. Sound effects are very well-used also. Together with an epic and magnificent soundtrack by James Horner, we have the recipe for a blockbuster film that collected three Oscars in technical categories (Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects and Best Art Direction), with all the fairness and merit. I really feel sorry that I didn't see it on the big screen and that Cameron is so careless when it comes to the script and the story he tells us.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I just finished watching this movie on DVD and it was incredible. I agree with many of the critics and reviews. This movie takes the art and creations to another level. There's a lot of good feelings going on for this film, and rightly so. After a Summer of lackluster crap, along comes this magnificent film. For once the hype was actually deserved. I won't talk about the plot, this film is best seen with as little information as possible. I didn't really expect the creation and picture to be this great but it was unreal. The picture truly is amazing I didn't expect the emotional impact, but Cameron is a master at pushing all the right buttons, and he does so here masterfully.<br/><br/>I know there were many bad critics, and some of them have reasons for hate. Most of them have criticisms of the plot. Some of the criticism lies in the \"surface\" quality of the plot, but again, Cameron has never made deep, cerebral films. Cameron is an entertainer, and thank God for it. This film is pure, futuristic, ahead of it's time escapism. I was absolutely floored. It shows the world beyond a world. Its an outstanding journey and was a great thing to finally watch this film</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">$300 million-plus Big Screen video game run amuck; pretty much sums it up, don't it? Cameron, clearly a fan of Robert Heinlein (STARSHIP TROOPERS), Joe Haldeman (ALL MY SINS REMEMBERED), and Harlan Ellison (SOLDIER, DEMON WITH A GLASS HAND), has actually managed, this time around, to incorporate THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS into his Big Screen video game. How's THAT for juxtaposition...? Unfortunately, the end result is something less than satisfying (unless, of course, you have the constitution to sit through a 3-hour-long video game, couched in the usual clichéd military setting- which I don't). On a somewhat related note, I found out the hard way (by first purchasing and then watching it) that the \"director's cut\" of George Lucas's THX-1138 had been TAMPERED with: spankin' new cgi have been added that undercut the gritty realism that made the \"original version\" so much better. There is at least one reference to a \"wookie\" being run over (yuk-yuk) and the in-bred trolls who attack Duvall at movie's end have been replaced by unconvincing cgi monsters. Maybe, one of these days, filmmakers will learn to leave well enough alone- but I doubt it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">A lot of mystery was created around this movie, since the very first years of production. This was the first movie of James Cameron since he made the successful film (Which I hated) \"Titanic\". I wasn't sure what to expect, especially after seeing the first reviews, which compared this film with revolutionary works as \"Star Wars\". Fortunately, I wasn't disappointed of what I saw. \"Avatar\" is much, much better than \"Titanic\". Probably it received more hype than it actually deserved, but it was a funny, exciting adventure. Basically, as many users said before, it is a futuristic version of \"Dances with Wolves\", with some elements of \"Pocahontas\" and \"Ferngully\". Sure it had a lot of clichés, and stereotypical characters, but \"Avatar\" works very well anyway: The story, despite being predictable, it still have a lot of fun to offer. Also, the visual are simply wonderful, creating a completely new world never seen before in movies. This was definitely the best part of it, and it makes interesting even the most boring and trivial parts of the story. I'm not sure if \"Avatar\" is a \"revolutionary\" film. The only thing that I could say that for being such an ambitious film, it doesn't disappoint. Sure, it isn't the best film ever made, but it was very funny to watch.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The moment in Avatar you know the whole thing is a load of nonsense, and is more preoccupied with all things visual, is the moment the lead has a conversation with a superior clambering into a thirty foot tall robot amidst a hangar full of them. What banal dialogue follows could have unfolded in an office, or anywhere else; but no, it's in a large hangar with lots of other 'stuff' going on as well. The pinch is right there; the statement that Cameron is more interested in delivering things as big and as brash as possible, no matter how routine the actual detail going on therein is. Avatar is a plodding; numbing; stumbling; fumbling chore of an experience, a heavy; wavy film which stomps from one thing to another in a self-reflective, clumsily plotted manner; all the while pandering to a crowd whom, it seems, are thick enough to fall in love with a picture if it quenches the attention span but additionally carries some kind of coherent narrative complete with light substance. In short, it's a whole lot of fuss over absolutely nothing. Throughout the film, certain winged creatures that can be flown around on have something plugged into them enabling their taming, and under the rider's control. A similar process has happened to Avatar's fans: they've been caught, re-tuned to writer/director Cameron's vision and now they're all dancing to his music.<br/><br/>Twelve years had past between 1997's Titanic and Avatar, if another twelve goes by before Cameron again graces the silver screen then it may well be too short-a time. But, the film covers the exploits of paraplegic American grunt Jake Sully (Worthington), an individual who touches down on a jungle-clad moon known as Pandora in true Platoon fashion, what with the coming down of an aircraft; the lowering of a ramp and the bleary eyed entrance into a world of violence and vegetation. Cameron shoots the new world through their eyes for our benefit, exemplified by way of the distinct, eye-level point of view shot that we get of the marines jogging down off the aircraft for the first time; a world just as strange and scary to him as it is to us with the odd buildings; vehicles and general mise-en-scene that surrounds the base camp, so we're plunged into this guy's shoes very early on.<br/><br/>Avatar begins with Jake waking up out a long period of space rest; a fitting, metaphorical re-birthing into a new world (there's a lot of clumsy talk of \"birth\" and being \"reborn\"). Then all the build up of the locale begins. Local head of operations Miles Quaritch (Lang) spends most of the film strutting around debriefing rooms, barking dialogue. Also, he lifts weights; flexes his muscles; sits on chairs the wrong way around in an attempt to intimidate and stomps about in large, mechanical fighting units that act as an extension of his own power and masculinity. His warnings of the location of Pandora and of the things that lurk within see him make us aware of an off screen threat, an attempt to build pressure and an aura of both mystery and danger – \"There are things that can kill you and that are tough to kill\" he informs, as the horrid scars of his own day one here act as a further reminder of the dangers. The principle threat is from the \"Na'vi\"; a tall, blue alien species.<br/><br/>Then there is the location, the lush and dense location of Pandora; a mixture of the jungles of East Asia with what it's like being in some of the more larger greenhouses at the site of London's Kew Gardens. People have come away awe struck, their defences of the film have revolved around the effects and the visual factor but slap the film on a television screen, in two dimensions, and maybe have it play out in black and white and you and your argument would be lost, as there's barely anything to support the visuals. Indeed, there's a sequence when one character is piloting a craft with another and exclaims: \"Oh my God!\" in sheer awe at what's around him, in what is a truly dopey 'knowing' moment; this time on what the audience reaction OUGHT to be to the same sight. Cameron's retort is: \"You should see the look on your faces.\" but the look on mine was of a frown.<br/><br/>Jake gets lost on Pandora, so much so that after we've had a little interaction with some native beasties Skull Island style, Zoe Saldana's native moon dwelling Na'vi girl Neytiri bumps into him with intent to put a poisonous arrow through him. Hark, a floating jellyfish-come-dandelion lands on the nib and saves him – it' s a sign; he's a 'chosen one' and Cameron's soft storytelling makes itself painfully known. When Jake meets her, everything on Pandora lights up; the plants glow and the intimidating atmosphere vanishes; foreshadowing the connection they have and the arc of their relationship.<br/><br/>The would-be all-conquering American tyrant figure of Quaritch, a man gunning for his 'unobtanium' supply located within, is nothing more than a dopey parable while towards the end, I was distracted: it's a wonder the Na'vi aren't already extinct, as they've barely anything to eat; spend most of their time leaping from branch to branch a mile up purely to journey somewhere else and they go on cliff side suicide missions in trying to tame flying beasts. I can imagine the tongue-in-cheek on-set conversations Cameron had with Worthington over the recent Terminator sequel debacle being more interesting than most of Avatar, a film that has burrowed its way into its audience's subconscious in that the lead 'leaves' his current existence to become someone/thing else, much like you 'leave' your real existence and become someone/thing else when booting up a video game. Avatar exists to sell action figures and Pandora themed top trumps playing cards. I agree that Avatar was spectacular: a spectacular disappointment.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is still pure eye candy to watch - the weakest point maybe is the rather simple and generic story line (if you take all the sci fi glamour away you get Pocahontas). Anyway, the effects and visuals are top-notch and the tempo of the story unfolding never leaves you bored. Still a fine looking and entertaining sci-fi action movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie is less about plot and more about universe creation. Calling this movie stylish is an understatement, it is a visual masterpiece that goes a long way to cover up the simple story.<br/><br/>But what a universe!

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Avatar\" is a great looking movie. There's no denying that. The story and the characters aren't that original but that doesn't bother me. What bothers me about \"Avatar\" is the length. It's too long by at least a half an hour. I saw this movie in the theater in 3D (Lynbrook, NY) and several times since. My reaction is always the same. I'm all in for in first couple of hours or so but then my interest starts to fade. \"Avatar\" is a near miss for me.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I saw Avatar in the theater when it was released. I thought it was a lot of fun and exciting to watch. However, I found the story to be sub-par and more of a copy of the destruction of indigenous tribes from all over the world. Not that is a bad thing, but it was boring because it made the story predictable an unoriginal.<br/><br/>The graphics are great and I thought seeing it on the big screen was well worth the time and cost. The movie deserves to be played on the best televisions if you are watching at home. Watching it on a small pad or phone really doesn't do it justice.<br/><br/>I do have problems with some of the graphics and a perfect example is fire and how it burns. The atmosphere is 20% heavier than Earth and flames shouldn't react the way they are depicted with the higher carbon dioxide. There is less than 8% oxygen in the air. I'm not sure the director really thought this one out.<br/><br/>The armored-mech units also move because they need to and this is deus ex machina and a writing fallacy. It is cheap and poorly executed idea. Sure one could say that they have better technology to make them react this way, but if you think of the physics of large machines like this, in the animal kingdom too, larger creatures move slower but are more powerful. I found it unappealing to see this in the movie.<br/><br/>The direction is all wrong because the movie uses deus ex machina through out the entire movie. Things happen because the writers/director force them to happen. The movie doesn't flow naturally and it is oddly pieced together with scenes which are filler.<br/><br/>Overall, its a good movie, but ranking it? That's difficult. A+ for the graphics but a D and C grade on writing and direction with a lower mark for the lack of logic.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">My \"Avatar\" is an odd film, isn't it? The week I rewatched it, it overtook \"Endgame\" as the highest grossing film of all time again - but I do find that stat baffling. I mean, as a film, it's fine but there are dozens of equally themed action adventures that didn't manage anything like the level of success.<br/><br/>Set in the future, the human race has landed on Pandora and has begun strip mining the planet for a natural resource. Aside from a strong military presence, the mining firm are attempting diplomatic measures, interacting with the native population using genetically engineered bodies, designed to replicate the Navi's large size, blue skin and ability to breathe the atmosphere. These avatar bodies are piloted by humans, one such is Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) a former marine who slowly becomes intoxicated by the connected and transcendent ways of the natives.<br/><br/>I mean, it's a pretty thin parable for the native American experience, or any country that knew the joys of British colonialism. We want what those people have, lets call them savages and move them off their land with an overwhelming force and then (in our case) teach them religion and cricket. It's a well-worn, oft repeated story - which again, makes it a little more baffling why this particular version of the narrative earned as much money as it did.<br/><br/>There is one way though that it is superior to a lot of the others, it looks incredible. Still, 12 years later it's the very cutting edge of CGI work. The planets, the interaction, the various forms of flora and fauna and the Navi themselves all look amazing. Occasionally, the interaction between the soldiers and their mechwarrior style rigs is a little off, but only occasionally, and in the climactic scenes they're spot on again.<br/><br/>It's a decent, good even, but I can't fathom why people went to see it so many times, nor who wants the four upcoming sequels.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Defenders say it's an incredible piece of artistic &amp; technical wizardry. Maybe, but that only takes it so far before the far-from-compelling story rears its giant blue head. Detractors say it's a blatant copy of movies like Dances with Wolves &amp; Pocahontas. Maybe, but it's also better than both of those. In reality, Avatar is just an over-hyped AND over-criticized cornball epic, equal parts exciting &amp; frankly boring. Still, the universe is cool enough to make the sequels appealing.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">To be honest \"Avatar\" is the most perfect superficial movie. What do I mean? It looks exciting, feels exciting, but I couldn't generate a feeling for it.<br/><br/>I think \"Avatar\" is a must see movie mainly because it's a part of the history of cinema. The reason? the extreme hype it generated even after coming out in theaters.<br/><br/>I'm sure I was one of the last people to watch it on theaters (January 30th) and believe me, I had high expectations towards it because everybody talked about it.<br/><br/>The truth is that \"Avatar\" isn't by any means the best movie of all time, or even a film that should change your life or cinema overall.<br/><br/>Sure, it's a movie that will out stand you with it's spectacular, amazing F/X. I can't think of any other movie with such powerful images and atmosphere. I mean, the world created for the movie is taken from dreams or something similar. Also, the Na'vi lifestyle is beyond fantasy and I give credit for the writers. <br/><br/>The main problem in my opinion is the lack of a strong plot. Sure, there's a message towards our planet and how we take care of it's natural resources and all the political correctness; but in terms of creativity I don't think the film gives us enough.<br/><br/>Sure, I cared for the main characters and their situations but the plot didn't thrill me by any means. <br/><br/>There's plenty of action, emotional speeches, dialogs, etc. But the movie focuses way too much on the exterior and leaves behind the plot.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington is the new action hero and I second it. He's good looking, he acts very well, and truly delivers \"passion\" in his scenes. <br/><br/>Zoe Saldana is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance although we only see her Avatar. Sigourney Weaver is amazing as always. Stephen Lang delivers enough badass lines, scenes, and more to be considered one of the most hated characters in recent film history. Too bad I didn't care for him in the end. Giovanni Ribisi does his thing just OK and Michelle Rodriguez is just way too hot. Her cleavage stole my attention several times.<br/><br/>The score is great, fantastic. A new epic in all the sense of the word. \"Avatar\" is truly one of the most spectacular movies ever made. That's it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron is a storied director whose films have been landmarks of their time. Like he did in the '80s and '90s with both Terminator films, he returns from his 10-year hiatus without missing a beat, shepherding audiences into the future of cinema with progressive film-making done with the most advanced technology. \"Avatar\" is a miraculous visual feat, the greatest epic since \"The Lord of the Rings\" and a film-making milestone unlike any other. At the conclusion of a decade, it's a window into what audiences of the future can expect at the movies.<br/><br/>There really is no film \"Avatar\" can be compared to other than \"Star Wars\" because of the science-fiction originality. The world of Pandora and Na'vi all come from Cameron's head as did the Star Wars universe from that of George Lucas. Although \"Star Wars\" is a much wider and complex universe, \"Avatar's\" world is still incredibly imaginative and awesome. Spectacle is \"Avatar's\" greatest asset and Cameron utilizes it completely, bringing our attention to all the tightest details. The multitude of creatures inhabiting Pandora and the remarkably life- like Na'vi captivate almost entirely on looks alone.<br/><br/>The story of \"Avatar\" uses classic archetypes that while not entirely original best serve the purposes of the film. Jake Sully (up-and-coming Aussie Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic ex-marine given a second chance by filling in for his brother on an operation on the planet Pandora. He becomes part of the Avatar program, which allows humans to enter artificially created Na'vi (the humanoid blue cat-like natives) versions of themselves. Sully's mission is to get to better know the Na'vi and their culture from the inside, but Col. Quatrich (Stephen Lang) convinces him to divulge intel should the Na'vi not be willing to abandon their home so the humans can force their way to a rare and valuable resource called unobtainium located there.<br/><br/>Naturally, Jake gets very close to the Na'vi tribe, who teaches him the Na'vi way of life. He becomes attached to their \"princess\" Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) who takes him through rites of passage, explaining how the Na'vi are connected with the planet and all living things on it in the figurative and literal sense. We're introduced to a world unlike anything we've seen before. Predictably, the Na'vi and humans are destined for a fatal showdown and Jake's change of heart will make him the controversial key to its end.<br/><br/>Cameron's script is very socially driven. Using terms like \"fighting terror with terror\" and \"shock and awe,\" it's blatantly critical of America and completely unforgiving of the human race. You'll come out of \"Avatar\" thinking how awful we are and how Cameron assigns us no redeeming qualities other than the few characters that decide the oppression of the Na'vi is wrong. It does, however, effectively sway our emotions. The most riveting concept in the film is that although Jake becomes \"one of them,\" his actual self is in a machine and any tampering with it brings him back to his handicapped human self. In this way \"Avatar\" is one- of-a-kind in terms of story.<br/><br/>In classic Cameron fashion, \"Avatar\" is incredibly long, but with the motion-capture CGI and 3D (and you must see it 3D to experience the scope), it's completely justified. Parts do drag and feel unrealistic or excessive at times, but the sheer magnitude of the movie and its visual prowess are plenty of an excuse to go a tad over-the-top.<br/><br/>Some other impressive food-for-thought about this movie is how humans are not only the enemy but they're not integral to the film. Never before has a live-action movie not needed to rely on human characters. The motion-capture and the subtle human qualities of Na'vi are good enough to carry the film. Other producers might've sought to counter that with big- name actors, but Cameron (like in his other films) refuses. This insanely expensive project not only benefited from saving that cash, but is testament to Cameron's storytelling ability.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" is simply an experience -- a ground-breaking and truly miraculous endeavor from the mind of cinema's most forward-thinking filmmaker. It's one of those rare achievements where flaws are so easily forgiven because of sheer innovation and imagination.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron is an interesting director, increasingly M.I.A. but seemingly invulnerable to the risk of the huge productions he tackles on the rare occasions when he does return to work. Back in the days of \"True Lies\" and \"Titanic\", everybody expected his next \"most expensive movie ever\" to be the Heaven's Gate of FX film. But by now most of us have given up that expectation as it seems he has an incredible knack for picking the kind of stories that work well with FX and tie together action and sentiment. Really the only time he's failed was with \"The Abyss,\" a movie that you had to admire but which was hard to enjoy. I kind of expected \"Avatar\" to be a more elaborate version of \"Abyss\", but it's quite a lot more cohesive (if simple) and compelling than any of his action films in quite a number of years.<br/><br/>So let that be the first caveat, and the first qualifier -- this is an action movie. Those who expected it to be high drama and/or to challenge the formulas of film storytelling, will have to look elsewhere (hint: Terry Gilliam has a new one out on DVD this month too). While the film does have an interesting sci-fi premise -- basically it's a reverse of his original \"Terminator\" film, in which machines were designed to look like humans to infiltrate their refugee camps, while in this one humans are the baddies and they use \"avatars\" in native form to infiltrate alien camps -- it doesn't really go anywhere with it. Basically the story is more of a melodrama than anything else, about an invading human being persuaded to the side of the native Na'vi viewpoint and helping to beat the attacking hordes of humans.<br/><br/>It doesn't really matter, because I found myself watching this in 3D in the theater basically not wanting to miss a second of it. It's just all so fascinating to look at, even if you're never entirely 100% inside the world of the movie. Or at least I wasn't. Constantly we're just so awestruck by the fantasy world that we start to think about the effects, which kind of takes you out of the movie, but then you don't want to stop watching to see what will happen next (in the effects, not the story), so it's very engrossing cinema regardless of where the interest is coming from.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Remember the 1995 flick Pocahontas where a native American princess named Pocahontas falls for an English Sea Captain and that 2010 live- action flick from Columbia Pictures The Smurfs,well what if you put these two movies into a blended machine and make it into a sci-fi flick set in 2030 or whatever,well that's what James Cameron the director of Titanic did in this highly overrated flick.<br/><br/>The movie is about a disabled marine played by Sam Worrington who goes undercover as an Avatar to find out some secrets and to protect the land Pandora. Along with a scientist played by Signorary Weaver and Joey David Moore the two team up with Jake(Worrington)and they are each assigned to go into a sun like bed that transports their minds into their cloned Avatar bodies. But when Jake is enjoying his freedom as he can move like an ordinary human,he falls in love with Na'vi played by Zoe Saldana from Star Trek little does she know that the Avatar is really a disabled marine in disguise. <br/><br/>The Good: The effects to Avatar is brilliant they deserve a 10/10 for me because I love how it transports you to another dimension and the way the actors move in their CGI Avatar bodies is really cool.<br/><br/>Now to the bad: The Story and GOD this movie is on for 3 hours long and it sometimes drags on too much also its a very complicated movie because it never explains to the audience what happened to Jake's condition,was he born to be paralysis-ed,what happened to him and what happened to his brother did he die after saving his country its just so slow paced.<br/><br/>Overall though i've only seen this movie 3 times already and its only good for the effects the rest just drags on and on and on.<br/><br/>Im giving it a 7/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">When all is said and done, when you look at Avatar as a movie apart from its social phenomenon, you are supposed to find this a parable for Western politics. Cameron clearly does. Indeed, implicating computer technology for its central role in man-made destruction, Avatar nevertheless utilizes the very same to create some of its innovative and hugely influential visuals. The bulk of Cameron's work displays an apparent distrust of technological advancement which is peculiarly at variance with his elaborate deployment of state-of-the-art cinematic technology. His post-Vietnam and post-feminist action epics---Aliens, the Terminator movies, True Lies---draw upon both technological and nuclear anxiety in the midst of Reagan's resurgent Cold War politics.<br/><br/>Avatar itself is fundamentally hailed for being a technological advancement. It is an exceedingly, outlandishly gigantic visual experience unlike anything we've seen before. It has an explicit Green and anti-war message. The writings on the wall dictate that it launch a worshipping faddism. It contains such visual embellishment that it surely sweetens repeated viewings. It even authors a new language to which I doubt human beings can do justice. It is the quintessential event movie, one of those films you feel you need to see to keep up with social discourse. Setting Napoleonic, Bond villain-esque humans against virtuous extraterrestrial rebels is a hopeful U-turn of the Aliens stencil, but perhaps requires Paul Verhoeven's keen comic-book intensity to drive the reversal into real subversion.<br/><br/>The human analogy on the lush, Earth-like moon of Pandora is a ten-foot-tall blue-skinned species of sentient humanoids called the Na'vi. An Earth corporation is mining a valuable mineral known with mystifying ambiguity as unobtanium. But for us humans to brave outside of our landing domain, we use avatars, Na'vi doppelgangers grown naturally and mind-controlled by humans who lay down wired up unconscious on the ship, which is where the 3-D element becomes more than just an ogling tool and takes on a metaphysical effect. While functioning as avatars, we sense and feel like Na'vi, and have all the same physical skill. The most interesting element of this is how the hero is a paraplegic. Rather than being a self-evident badass, he's been recruited since he's a genetic match for his dead twin brother, for whom an expensive avatar was constructed. In avatar state he is exhilarated by his magnified ability to walk again, not to mention being ten feet tall, and his compensation for this assignment he will be given a very expensive operation to recover movement in his legs. Theoretically he's good to go, for if his avatar is harmed, his human body is elsewhere.<br/><br/>The Na'vi survive in their world by having a deep relationship with it, living as one with nature, and being thoughtful about the creatures they share with. In this and various other ways they symbolize Native Americans. Like them, they discipline another species to have them at their disposal, like giant flying dragon-like creatures. On that admirable note, I found the significance tapering into impatience nearing its obligatory colossal climactic showdown between humans and aliens. After all a character has done that has betrayed the noble Na'vi, returning to them with a demonstration that he has tamed a supposedly untamable dragon-like super-creature, all is forgiven. It's just too sexy for them to stay mad anymore.<br/><br/>Indeed the bigger it all is, the cockier. Every bit of James Cameron's muscle seems to go into making our eyes bulge and genuflect in worship of the 3-D dazzle on the screen. On one hand, it's an outstandingly accessible exhibition of defying capitalism and championing the up-hill battle for the defense of nature, but done with mostly stale dialogue and boilerplate characterization. Essentially, it's a $237 million, 162-minute montage of cardboard allegories and plot devices, made by putting a bunch of screenplays in a blender. But we still say Wow! And why not? If you can get a theater full of people here in the American Midwest to flock to and cheer for America getting conquered by an indigenous tribe in war, then you've got one amazing work of spectacle. It's the experience, more than the allegory, that's worth a nod.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">There have been perhaps two or three films in my lifetime that have been so good that I went back into the movie theater to see them a second time. This one's one of them.<br/><br/>Director James Cameron has been one of Hollywood's most successful and most prolific film makers for a long time. My personal theory is that he's just so good at giving the audience exactly what they want to see in order to be pleased, shocked, rejuvenated, excited and entertained. After the box office miracle story that was Titanic, he moved away from the central stage and only returned back to full-length feature film with this one: Avatar, the highest-grossing film of all time, managing to surpass even Titanic. And thus Cameron has directed the two highest-grossing films of all time. That's pure talent.<br/><br/>So what makes Avatar so interesting and so engrossing? Well, on the technical side of things, at the time of its release, Avatar was THE best looking film we had ever seen. Four years have since passed and it has withstood the test of time remarkably well, and I think that it will continue to do so. It's an utterly breath-taking film. The foreign world of Pandora opens in front of your eyes in thousands of shades of colour, each individual plant, creature and mountain a miracle to look at in its own right. Gorgeous, beautiful, majestic, awe-inspiring are all words that this films easily earns.<br/><br/>This artistry alone would warrant me to recommend this film, but I also happen to like the story and the characters a great deal. Avatar has been accused of rehashing old \"white man amongst natives\" story lines. It has been accused of being just a ripoff of Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, Ferngully and countless other similar films. I don't get these people. The stories have similarities, yes, and Avatar is a bit predictable, but do these people really claim that if a particular story has already been told, you are not allowed to try and make a better version of that story, your version? Because that's what Avatar is. It's this generation's \"amongst natives\" story, told with gorgeous imagery, great characters and exciting storytelling. So what if you can predict how the story's going to end. The same holds true for all the romantic comedies, most of the action films and all the sport films, yet people don't complain when those have a storyline that's similar to previous films. Well, okay, some do, but not as vehemently as they did in the case of Avatar. Backlash against its success, maybe? <br/><br/>Avatar's story is just fine. It's the visuals, the world, the music and the characters that make an adventure film like this work, and all four of those are great. I've already stated my opinion about Pandora and how it looks on screen. James Horner's score fits the mood and style of the film perfectly, being grandiose, little bit foreign and dramatic. Likewise with the actors that all do a really good job. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana have great chemistry together as Jake Sully, the crippled marine, and Neytiri, the princess of the Na'vi. Special mention should also go to Stephen Lang and his character Colone Miles Quaritch, one of the most badass soldiers in recent cinema history.<br/><br/>Longish review, but that's because it's a movie that divides opinions. Some people seem to hate it because of its seeming unoriginality, others focus on the good sides and absolutely love it. I belong to the latter camp and thus Avatar belongs amongst my favourite movies of all time. See it, if you haven't already.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Classifying 'Avatar' as science fiction is a misnomer. If you take away the whole idea of the Avatar technology, you end up with a standard Hollywood action movie. And the technology is truly dispensable. For the year 2154, I'd rather have a genetically modified humanoid standing on his own two feet rather than an 'avatar'. Both ideas are far-fetched, but the idea of an avatar who is controlled through some kind of vague telepathic commands emanating from a human being deep asleep while in a coma seems much more the stuff of comic books than semi-plausible science fiction.<br/><br/>Without the Avatar 'gimmick', Cameron's story is nothing more than an allegory of the mistreatment of Native Americans by the 'white man'. Cameron harks back to the 17th century where the idea of the 'noble savage' was in vogue. So-called 'primitive' people were held up as 'natural' and 'spiritual', untarnished by the corrupting effects of western civilization. Also at play were deep-seated guilt feelings over the perceived deleterious effects of European colonialism.<br/><br/>In Cameron's tale, the 'colonialists' have been updated to military contractors who have somehow bought the 'heart and soul' of the American military itself (we're told that the adventurers on 'Pandora' are ex-Marines, all there for the money). The contractors are headed by two stock villains: Parker Selfridge (the civilian corporate chief) and Colonel Quaritch (an amalgam of the worst right-wing military types you could ever think of). Cameron makes no effort in humanizing his two antagonists. On the other hand, the indigenous people, the 'Na'vi' can do no wrong. Not only have they mastered their skills in surviving in the wild but have tapped into the mystical forces of the forest which put our own holistic healers to shame.<br/><br/>While the Na'vi are certainly stand-ins for Native Americans, they are not Native Americans of the American West in the 19th century but rather more akin to earlier forest dwelling Indians as depicted in James Fenimore Cooper's \"Last of the Mochicans\" (is it a coincidence that one of the stars of the early 90s film version of that book is Wes Studi who plays 'Eytukan' here?) Cameron must bring in other cinematic influences to make sure that this is not simply a rehash of an early 18th century romantic novel. In the beginning, with images of space travelers coming out of suspended animation inside a spaceship, one is reminded of such iconic films as '2001: A Space Odyssey' and the sci-fi horror tale, 'Alien'. And what about all those futuristic helicopters that are constantly firing missiles at the hapless natives? I can only think of mediocre Vietnam-era war movies such as 'The Green Berets' starring John Wayne. Avatar is also derivative of Spielberg films such as \"Jurassic Park\" with its emphasis on prehistoric creatures who seem to have a continuous anger management problem.<br/><br/>As for Avatar's plot, it's all rather predictable stuff. The enlightened 'scientists' are pitted against the hard-boiled military, none of whom seem to have a conscience. The film's hero, Jake Sully, already is told that the bad guys are planning to wipe the Na'vi out but it takes him three months to warm up to them. I had a hard time believing that Sully would side so easily with the evil Colonel from the beginning—yes he was offered the 'carrot' of getting his legs back but as a paraplegic wouldn't that have made him wary of the Colonel's unrelenting disdain for the underdog? In other words, wasn't it obvious that the Colonel was a real bad guy from the very beginning? What's more, wouldn't Sully have tried to warn the Na'vi earlier instead of waiting to the last hour? He could have perhaps persuaded one or two Na'vi to form a reconnaissance team and to check out the base in order to convince them that the enemy had the capability to wipe them out. Also, at the end, why did the Na'vi let the defeated enemy leave the planet? Wouldn't they have slaughtered all of them? (Oh I forgot—they're Noble Savages!).<br/><br/>Despite the derivative and mediocre story, Avatar keeps your interest due to its excellent special effects. Cameron is a master at computer animation and keeps you riveted on all the action despite insulting your intellect. Avatar is a sensory delight but seeing it more than once is not recommended.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is phenomenal! Nowhere else is the Pagan story told so clearly, lovingly, and well. This is a film for all time, all peoples; it resonates with the indigenous peoples throughout the world, with the lives of their ancestors, and the oral histories passed down by hundreds of cultures.<br/><br/>Aside from that, we found Avatar to be entertaining, well made, creatively produced, and lovingly presented. There are many factors in this film one can love and designate as a \"favorite part,\" well established characters, and a tight storyline with good pacing.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">'Avatar' is a fancy word -- an appropriate one, I guess, for a movie that is both awesome and silly. As the movie explains, it's a Hindu term for the incarnation of a god on earth. But actually, just as in the recent movie 'Surrogates' (which Cameron was involved in) and 'The Matrix,' somebody is lying in a room all wired up while he or she is running a virtual second self doing stuff out somewhere. That's what an \"avatar\" is. In 'Surrogates' the virtual selves are mainly just misbehaving. In 'Avatar,' we're on the planet Pandora, where a private corporation, RDA, whose boss, a pale nasty named for a British department store, Selfridge (Giovani Ribisi), is aiming to extract major quantities of a super-valuable mineral called (I said silly, remember) 'Unobtainium.' There's a bunch of gung-ho racist military earthling types headed by a Robert Duval substitute called Col. Quartich (Stephen Lang), ready to speed up this enterprise by blowing away the \"humanoid\" locals, which they refer to as \"blue monkeys,\" who're sort of sitting on the Unobtainium, in a lush forest. As in Duncan Jones' rather intriguing little movie 'Moon' (released in June), earthlings in 'Avatar's' world, set over a century in the future, have run out of terrestrial power sources and gone to outer space for new ones.<br/><br/>There's an opposing group of culturally sensitive scientists headed by the ever-tough and soulful Sigourney Weaver (known here as Grace), who know better. They realize that the tall, thin, and yes, blue indigenous people of the region are in fact the Omaticaya clan of the Na'vi. Led by Grace, the scientists have been learning the Na'vi language and making friends with the Omaticaya -- winning the \"hearts and minds,\" you know? They work with the Omaticaya in the form of \"avatars\" that are tall, blue, skinny people like them. This allows them to \"pass,\" so to speak, and make up for the fact that the air on Pandora is too thin to breathe. Meanwhile Quaritch and his boys are talking \"shock and awe\" and \"fighting terror with terror.\" Yeah, the references are as simple and schematic as that.<br/><br/>There's a whole lot going on in Cameron's's 'Avatar' -- and at the same time not very much. It takes a while to explain the setup, but after that it's pretty simple what happens.<br/><br/>Grace is very disappointed when Jake Sully arrives on Pandora. He's a Marine corporal sent to replace his dead twin brother, because he's got the right DNA to operate his brother's avatar, but while his brother was a scientist, he's just a jarhead who's been rendered paraplegic in a recent war. Jake's background makes him appeal a lot to Col. Quaritch, but Grace starts to like him when he takes so well to working his avatar that he connects right away with Omaticaya princess Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and is quickly adopted by her tribe. It's sort of an 'Emerald Forest'-cum-'Dancing with Wolves' situation -- Jake goes native. And he picks up a good speaking knowledge of Na'vi -- though the locals, due to Sigourney's teaching, tend to speak excellent English -- which might disappoint Professor Frommer of USC, whom Cameron engaged to invent a complete Na'vi language. There are speeches in Na'vi (with rather ornate subtitles, as if it were a medieval language), but the whole cultural thing is focused more on what we might call the neuro-spiritual element. <br/><br/>Cameron has spent hundreds of millions of dollars and engaged thousands in making this movie, and the fun of it is, for a while anyway, in the elaborate way the details of Pandora have been worked out. Quaritch describes it as worse than hell, and the six-legged dino-horses, hammerhead rhinos, shell-covered snarling tigers, four-armed lemurs, and so on, as well as the little floating jellyfish creatures, are pretty challenging for avatar-Jake his first night in-country. But since he bonds with Neytiri right away (her name even sounds a bit like Tommy/Tommee's Amazon forest girlfriend Kachiri in 'Emerald Forest'), and learns to turn terrifying flying beasts into his docile steeds by connecting the end of his pigtail to their neural tendrils, Jake's avatar life becomes way more exciting than anything he's ever done before, and in a running video journal he keeps, he admits he's begun to forget what the rest of his life was even like before this.<br/><br/>New York Times film critic A.O. Scott exclaimed recently that 'Avatar' is unusual as a blockbuster in that \"it doesn't come from a comic book, it doesn't come from a novel, it doesn't come from a line of toys, it comes from James Cameron's imagination.\" Well, the material here is very much like lots of sci-fi novels (the kind I used to read as a teenager), comic books, lines of toys, and video games, so there's nothing so extraordinary about Cameron's imagination. What's extraordinary is the mise-en-scene, and the way \"motion-capture\" is used to give the avatar's expressions and movements, and then they're digitalized to incorporate them in these rather sexy tall skinny figures with their rather corny Amerindian outfits and hairdos; and the elaborate flora and fauna of Pandora.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it all ends in a noisy, protracted shoot-out that makes it like the dreadful, but intermittently atmospheric, 'Terminator: Salvation' -- which, lo and behold, co-starred Sam Worthington. Watching this, as the noise and explosions became steadily drearier and more familiar, I realized that Cameron's 'Titanic,' which I loved much more than this, mainly because it had real people and events in it, however romantically magnified, also went on far too long. There are things about 'Avatar' that are very fun, but the Na'vi, even at their sexiest, still look like plastic-y video game dolls, and those who declare this to be a cinematic spectacle that's wonderful beyond anything since 1915 and D.W. Griffith (David Denby in the same interview) are really falling prey to the hype.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">In the magical world of director James Cameron, there lives a great genius. His repertoire of movies, lists some of Hollywood's most awesome cinematic adventures and this one will no doubt, crown all those fine achievements. In his ledger, are some astounding and certainly memorable films such as 'Apollo 13,' 'Abyss,' Titanic' and of course the futuristic 'Terminator.' All have made his name a household word. Here is yet another triumph for him and in this reviewer's opinion, his very best. The Movie is called \" AVATAR \" and even the name is mythic in nature. It's the story of a young wounded paraplegic Marine named Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) who volunteers to replace his twin brother and become an Avatar, on a supposedly scientific expedition under the direction of Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver). Her tasks is to study the rich Eco-system of the planet, searching for a rare material called Unobtainum. This unique material is the primary reason why Joel Moore (Norm Spellman) and his powerful business conglomerate have enlisted the military. The armed force is under the direction of Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) a no nonsense, hard core officer who promises to destroy the indigenous population of the planet, if need be to secure the mining rights. Unaware of their destructive intentions, Jake's clandestine mission on the planet Pandora, is to integrated into the tribes and learn how the military can decimate them. However, Jake soon discovers, if he succeeds, he will become a willing participant in the outright slaughter and brutal murder of a spiritual and peaceful race. The entire movie is a trill ride of a lifetime. The planet Pandora contains a gigantic plethora of natural splendor, incredible vistas, wondrous mystical creatures and a cornucopia of lasting beauty which could only arise in the mind of James Cameron. With a superb supporting cast containing Zoe Saldana (The new Uhura of Star Trek), Laz Alonso and Wes Studi, I am not surprised it top the charts and won the highest honors as well as a world wide audience all of which will assure this film becomes a Classic for future generations. A remarkable milestone for all. Enthustically recommended for all audiences. *****</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">After 12 years with his success with Titanic, the great action director James Cameron is back with the long-waited Avatar. Avatar is the most expensive film ever made, a possible revolution in cinema technology and 3D, and a massive gamble for Fox studios who under Tom Rothman have become the laughing stock of Hollywood (Rothman himself is still derided and hated though). There was a lot of hype surrounding the film, and some feared that it would underwhelm audience, but luckily it didn't.<br/><br/>On the moon planet Pandora, the RDA corporation is trying to mine the planet for unobtainium, the most valuable resource known to man. The Na'vi tribes people, a tall, blue skinned, nature loving, cat like people, live on the abundant source of it. The Company is willing to use military force, led by Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a tough military man. Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), a scientist wants to study the people and wildlife, and wants to use diplomacy to convince the Na'vi to move to a different site. She wants to win hearts and minds by educating the Na'vi. Here Jake Scully (Sam Worthington), a disabled former Marine, steps in. His twin brother had died, but he is a biological match to his Avatar, a genetically created Na'vi which human being could transfer their minds in. On a scientific mission Jake gets separated from the team and ends up meeting a native Na'vi, Neytiri (Zoë Saldaña). He joins the tribe, starts to learn their ways, their love and link to nature and starts to fall for Neytiri. But Jake is stuck in a three way conflict between the military (who he promises to give them intelligence), the scientists who want to study the planet and befriend the Na'vi, and the Na'vi themselves which he gains their trust, and where his loyalties belongs.<br/><br/>The story is nothing too original, their are elements of films like Lawrence of Arabia and The Last Samurai where an outside becomes a member of close knit tribe, the Matrix with the idea of transferring your mind into another body and allows you to do extraordinary things and the Alien series where a company is responsible for aggressive action. The story and theme of colonisation in the film was properly influenced by America's actions in the Wild West against Native Americans, but to me it reminded me of the East India Company and colonisation in Africa where forming colonies was influenced by private business, not government action. James Cameron is an excellent writer and crafts a lot of different ideas and plot in an brilliant film. There are a lot of factions and themes which are well told and Cameron follows his old ideas of character development. His classics like the Terminator and Aliens were great because of the characters, not just the action. All the characters are interesting, my personal favourite was Neytiri but all were given a chance to shine. As well as the theme of colonisation, the Vietnam and Iraq wars much have influenced Cameron. Iraq because of a military invasion of a foreign people for a valuable resource, and because of Vietnam and Iraq because a technological superior force is outnumbered and in a foreign climate. The last theme is the idea of technology against nature and the balance of live. The Na'vi are linked to nature and it's a part of their culture and religion, whilst the humans just destroy nature without a care. A commentary about Global Warning in today's world? Cameron is follow the Gaia hypothesis where the world is a living being with everything being interlinked.<br/><br/>What James Cameron is truly great at is action, and of course action is some of the best ever put to screen. As an action film by itself Avatar is the best of 2009 (though District 9 and Inglorious Basterds were very good). You actually get to see the action, the camera follows it, not shaking about or too close so you can't see anything. It is well edited and just a join to watch compared to some modern action films. Cameron transfers you to another world. He creates a beautiful world with wonderful designs, and with great creature designs as well. It reminds me of King Kong (both the 1933 and 2005 versions). Cameron did put a lot of thought into the history and culture of the Na'vi as well. The CGI is fantastic and the 3D is brilliant. It was so well done that it added depth to the film, giving it a more hands on feel. However I think 3D life Avatar are going to be few and far between, with 3D mostly being the reserve of animated films and B-Movie horror.<br/><br/>There is a good cast, that goes without saying. Zoë Saldaña, Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver are of particular note of praise. Sigourney Weaver almost reminded of her role as Dian Fossey in Gorillas in the Mist. Sam Worthington is clearly a star in the making, having stole the show in Terminator Salvation and now having the lead role in Avatar, I am looking forward to Clash of the Titans next year. It's also good to see Michelle Rodriguez career back on track.<br/><br/>There are some criticism of the film. First it's a bit too long, with a running time over two and half hours, and there are elements that could have been cut or shorten. Some of the dialogue was weak, and at times stated the obvious. I think Cameron was trying to come up with some more classic one-lines. And finally, as stated, some ideas and story elements were copied from other films.<br/><br/>Worth watching, and one of the most fun films I seen in the cinema for a whilst.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In 1999, the Wachowski brothers made a science fiction action movie which changed the face of action for a good five years as suddenly now every movie had to have this new thing called bullet-time, which is ironic since bullet-time is essentially proto-cinematic and the first \"movement tests\" of Muybridge circa 1880 were the exact same thing as bullet-time. The theme of The Matrix was essentially technophobic despite its game-changing technological spectacle because it said outright, \"Don't take that blue pill, get out of dream land and live in the real world. The sucky, barren, survivalist real world that is so much more worth saving than your tasty steak-filled dreamland.\" Exactly ten years later Cameron comes out with a movie about saving the environment and the killing off of our connection with the earth, but the entire narrative is developed through the titular thematic component, avatars. And no, not just the Na'Vi avatars. EVERYBODY in this movie has an avatar. The big bad meany boss commando is never more comfortable unless he's in his Cameron-favorite Mechwarrior. The Na'Vi download themselves right into the creatures of the forest. The ore-miner general uses his corporation as his avatar. The problem is that through all of this downloading, virtual recreation, and multiple personalities is that the theme of re-connecting to the world gets lost in the pure desire to log into a different outward appearance of one's self, which is never deconstructed, but in fact reinforced by the Na'Vi's own spiritual uploading of personalities between bodies. The weird thing is that the whole idea that the world of Pandora is a giant synaptic brain really never seems to be of consequence until the battle at the end, except that we're just supposed to believe in it based on what characters say, not what is shown. Whereas The Matrix makes it's downloading program quite clear from the, uh, intro screen. You know, that famous intro screen? Pandora never really makes its presence known except for an action sequence. I'm just sayin'.<br/><br/>The only two quotes that mattered: \"I see you now.\" And, \"Now real life felt more like the dream.\" These are the rough equivalents to The Matrix's \"Why do my eyes hurt?\" and \"Stop trying to hit me and hit me.\" Therefore, as much as I'm not really as critical of other people about Avatar's storytelling and themes (it's all archetypical and not worth getting upset over or endless comparisons to similar story lines), I just feel it's necessary to point out that wherein the medium is the message, the message of Avatar is \"Log in.\" It's a technophiliac celebration of virtual reality, and functionally so. I do not, in fact, consider that to be a negative thing or really criticize that approach, I just feel with the amount of attention this movie is getting, I have not really heard that acknowledged. So going to those people who are sad 'cause Pandora ain't real--it is, in fact, functionally dialectic to the experience of the film. Wherein fan culture develops through cultural events such as this film, I see Avatar as predominantly an invitation, and it's one that the world has seemed to accept. So now that the game has changed and 3D is the blockbuster motif, it is time to start reappraising fantasy worlds and figure out how to immerse the audience into truly alternative realities than simply escapist worlds.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Set in the year 2151 - This visually spectacular (yet emotionally haywire) tale of a ruthless rape attempt (by humans) of the planet Pandora for its valuable resources and the near-annihilation of the Na'vi peoples (an indigenous humanoid species of said planet) borrowed heavily (I think) from the well-known story of Tarzan.<br/><br/>Of course, Avatar's story was set on a much greater scale than that of a mere Tarzan-like \"jungle\" tale - But, all the same, that's how it appeared to me.<br/><br/>Avatar's story also brought to mind the reality of Christopher Columbus's \"discovering\" of America in 1492 and his search for valuable resources and the devastating effect that that fateful incident had on all of the native peoples of both the American continents.<br/><br/>With a film of this one's striking visual magnitude, it's so easy for the viewer to be completely swept away by the sheer beauty and wonder of it all and to just allow the story to take a back seat for itself.<br/><br/>And that is exactly what happened here with Avatar. It, unfortunately, relied far too heavily on the splendour of its visuals to carry it through and that left us with a story that already had the wind clearly knocked out of its sails by the half-way point.<br/><br/>*Note* - Directed by James Cameron - Avatar's budget was $237 million.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It's obvious within watching this 3D movie for the first 5 minutes, that this movie is breakthrough in cinematic expression in the class like the Star Wars was in the '70s. <br/><br/>The tone of the story for the first 1/4 of the movie makes you feel like you might be watching another dark tale of ostracized society like the one depicted in Matrix. I was thinking, oh, here we go again, darkness sold as \"realism\", or a story driven plot. Then 3/4 way into the story, it was like is it another cowboy and Indian movie, where the cowboys with modern weapons levels the indians who're basically fighting with bows and arrows. Then the complete surprise came in the last quarter of the movie where the cowboys are actually shown as the bad guys. There's no mistake that the \"Sky People\" depicted in this movie are \"Americans\" and their corporate greed, and military industrial complex has formed a fascist state of arrogance and insensitivity to any rights of others in the name of profit and control. I won't go into the spoilers of how the movie ends, but it's surprising that an American director (okay he's Canadian, but..) would take such objective view of his own country.<br/><br/>This is a movie that comes once in a life time, and is easily one of the top 10 movies of the last decade. I believe 3D experience will become the norm in future movies until 3D becomes a dirty word like so many over commercialized technology has become. Thumbs up for James Cameron.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's long-awaited Titanic follow-up is very pretty to look at but suffers from a flimsy plot and astoundingly stupid plot development. The characters are one dimensional, both as written and as portrayed, and there's hardly anything unpredictable. The only thing this movie has going for it are its state-of-the-art effects, which are truly boggling.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington plays Jake, a paraplegic ex-Marine who's sent to a distant moon to help humans mine a mineral called unobtainium (in the running for the least creative chemical name ever). Seems there's a huge cache of the stuff under a huge tree in a jungle that's populated by an indigenous race called the Na'vi, blue-skinned, really tall people with feline characteristics. Meanwhile, a scientific program headed by Grace Augustine (played by a typically stiff Sigourney Weaver) has focused on learning as much as possible about the Na'vi in order to benefit scientific knowledge. Augustine's research (funded by the same company who's mining the unobtainium) involves the use of avatars, in which scientists form a psychological link with a mock-up that looks just like a native Na'Vi, the better for the humans to exist within the unbreathable atmosphere. Jake gets inside the Na'vi within his avatar and attempts to find out what they would want in exchange for moving from away from the giant store of unobtainium; during the course of his mission, he falls for the Na'vi chief's daughter, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). (Of course he does.) And as said mission drags on, Jake's perspective changes from meathead jerk to tree-loving jerk, and he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right.<br/><br/>Is he serious? You're an alien race (humans) and have no business on this moon. Your employer's stated goal is to gobble up all the jewels he can find, basically raping the planet. Your employer will stop at nothing to get it, as he answers to no one. You're being sent down to find a diplomatic way to screw the natives out of the bounty on which they sit. And he thinks this might be wrong? A power grab ensues when the military leader of the human expedition, a Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) decides enough is enough and wants to bomb the hell out of the Na'vi, with the approval of the head of the company, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), another patently obvious name. This sets up the rather obvious showdown between the primitive Na'vi and the gung-ho ex-Marine humans, who have missiles and guns and ammo and rockets and helicopters and who knows, even a Star Destroyer or two. The final battle scene is overtly reminiscent of the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, in which the primitive Ewoks manage to defeat a stormtrooper army using only their quick wits and some old-school, homemade traps of destruction.<br/><br/>But even if the plot doesn't need to be complex, it sure ought to make sense. Here's a nonspoiler question to ponder. Jake, under the guise of his avatar, is taken in by the Na'vi, whose spiritual leader asks Neytiri to teach Jake their ways. Why this is to be is not terribly clear. It's evident that the humans have made several attempts at learning the ways of the Na'vi but that prior emissaries had been scientists; as soon as Jake tells the Na'vi that he's a warrior, they're all about teaching him. I don't quite follow the logic here; if I were the Na'vi and had not been able to teach the smart humans who obviously (to me) were not there to do me harm, why in the world would I want to teach someone who's used to using aggression and violence to solve problems? I get that the Na'vi, as a warrior race, would relate more to the soldier, but surely they would be reluctant to share knowledge with someone who was outside of their group anyway, let alone with one who might well do them harm.<br/><br/>Moreover, I'm not sure what the Na'vi thought Jake was, really. He looked like them, through his avatar, but they referred to him at least once as an alien. My best guess is that they just thought he was from another clan. Other clan? I'll assume that only this one clan, the Omaticaya, made its home at Hometree (yet another clumsy naming convention) and therefore was the only clan with a stake in protecting it. But if they simply thought Jake was from another clan, why did they let him in anyway? Why did they teach him? What purpose would it serve them? And on top of that, since the Omaticaya mentioned being approached by \"aliens\" before, doesn't it seem more likely that they would have assumed Jake was another alien ambassador anyway? This makes my brain hurt.<br/><br/>I think it's pretty obvious that Cameron wanted this to be his own Star Wars, an epic taking place on a distant world. He uses the standard Cameron recipe of astounding special effects and innovation coupled with a weak plot and laughable characters and hopes it all comes out okay (although for a movie that gestated for more than a decade, that's simplifying things a bit). The effects, it should be noted, are really mesmerizing visuals of the jaw-dropping variety. The 3D effects were unbelievable, and I mean that in a good way. Avatar is extraordinarily shot, using 60% CGI and 40% live action, and the two elements are flawlessly intertwined. It's a remarkable film.<br/><br/>But it's only part of a film. the entire movie seems to try pretty hard to keep some emotional distance from its audience, and when a film is emotionally uninvolving, it's lost the battle for your heart.<br/><br/>And that's the core problem. Despite some wonderful, beautiful effects, Avatar gives us characters in whom we can't really get invested, and when a key element of your story is an interspecies romance, this is a crucial, fatal flaw.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">How does James Cameron do it? How does he manage to take a hokey, transparent story and make it work? It is amazing. Just like with Titanic, Mr. Cameron creates a great movie out of an old story. The movie is great because it grabs and keeps the audience's interest. Also, Mr. Cameron takes CGI to a new level of sophistication, so much so that soon the CGI and the real acting merge as one ... and it works! Having expected this movie to be little more than a long cartoon, surprisingly the movie is a work of cinematic art, and not just an animated feature with voice overs added. The cast is superb, especially Stephen Lang, who plays perhaps the most challenging role, and the always lovely Michelle Rodriguez who gives a strong performance as a soldier with a heart. If this movie proves anything, it is that Michelle Rodriguez is one of the finest actors in Hollywood today, and beautiful too.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I'm going to be frank: James Cameron's 2009 sci-fi epic \"Avatar,\" his first feature film since 1997's \"Titanic,\" is hands-down the best movie I've seen so far this year. I mean that. Prior to that, it was \"District 9.\" I'm going to be even more frank: I've been pretty disappointed by the movies this year; I thought the aforementioned \"District 9\" was utterly brilliant, \"Drag Me to Hell\" is also worthy of some great mention, and so was \"Terminator Salvation.\" So the question is: Was \"Avatar\" worth the 12-year wait?<br/><br/>In a nutshell: hell yes!<br/><br/>Let's do a run-down of the usual James Cameron trademarks:<br/><br/><ul><li>Simple, but captivating and engrossing sci-fi story - check</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Simple, but well-crafted dialogue - check</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Groundbreaking special effects - check</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lots of appearances of the color blue - check</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Strong female characters - check</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Effective left-leaning social commentary - check</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Liberal doses of humor - check</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Evocative musical score - check</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>An utterly well-crafted and damn-brilliant sci-fi film with some (some is italicized) footing in reality - check, check, and triple-check!!!</li></ul><br/><br/>The film is set in the year 2154 (note that it takes place 25 years before Cameron's own 1986 film \"Aliens\") on the distant alien moon Pandora. Pandora has since been colonized by humans, who are there looking to profit from its enormous supply of precious minerals. This has put humans at odds with the indigenous population, towering blue-skinned sentient humanoids called Na'vi, and other beautiful albeit terrifying forms of extraterrestrial life-forms. The Na'vi aren't your typical extraterrestrial primitives: they are more than a physical match for the heavily armed military forces of Earth, and they aren't going to roll over and let their home be ravaged by greedy capitalists (sounds familiar, doesn't it?).<br/><br/>The military does have a plan: they're going to send one of their own, a paraplegic space Marine named Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), to live amongst the Na'vi, AS A Na'vi. It turns out that the Earth scientists, led by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, of \"Aliens\"), have developed the technology that has allowed them to clone perfect replicas of Na'vi beings that are inhabited by the consciousness of humans. They call these replicas \"avatars.\" (In Hindu mythology, an avatar is a reincarnated deity, but can also mean a temporary representation of a person, object, or concept in a virtual world; the film deals largely with the second definition.)<br/><br/>Being an avatar gives Sully an optimistic new outlook on his life and career, as well as a newfound sense of freedom from the confines of being a wheelchair-bound war veteran. Predictably, he is reluctantly welcomed into the Na'vi way-of-life by Neyteri (Zoe Saldana) and is thus absorbed into their culture. He comes to see for himself that they are not the primitive, violent savages that they were made out to be by his handlers, and eventually develops a love for Neyteri, her people and her world, putting his mission and loyalties to the human race at risk. And it soon becomes clear that he may very well be the only thing keeping these peaceful creatures from being exterminated by Earth's gung-ho military forces.<br/><br/>Let me just say this movie is a phenomenon, and a continual pleasure to watch on the screen. I wasn't expecting the epic magnificence of \"Titanic,\" but I was expecting something on the scale of \"The Terminator\" (1984) - my favorite Cameron film, my favorite sci-fi film, and my #3 favorite film of all time - and \"Aliens.\" (Cameron has been wise in expecting \"Avatar\" to not outdo \"Titanic.\") \"Avatar\" has been Cameron's pet project since 1995, but he felt that the special effects technology of the time was not developed well enough. And we know where he went next.<br/><br/>Cameron has always had a way with special effects in his movies: he's careful to not drown the humans, their performances, and our emotional attachments to them in endless special effects sequences. (And there are plenty of epic battle sequences to get your mouth watery, so don't worry about Cameron skimping on suspenseful action scenes.) Even though the film is done largely using highly advanced motion-capture animation techniques, the performances from Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana especially are virtually flawless, and they are able to give their computer-generated alien counterparts believable ranges of emotion that allow great sympathy toward them and their cause.<br/><br/>I have to say that since James Cameron is my favorite director, he has done it again: he has made a movie that defies expectations and the imagination, and is yet another worthy entry into an otherwise impeccable catalog of big-budget, groundbreaking special effects-laden spectacles. I will be very displeased with the Academy Awards if \"Avatar\" does not win all of the special effects categories, because it deserves them - all of them. \"Avatar\" is filled with stunning performances, special effects and imagery so that if I'm not mistaken in my honest opinion, this is the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>10/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Defying all analytical expectations, James Cameron's follow-up to 'Titanic (1997)' not only proved commercially successful, but actually out-grossed its colossal predecessor. Yet the mantle of history's highest-grossing film is not easily borne. By the end of January 2010, with $2 billion worth of ticket sales behind it, one finds it impossible not to form unrealistic expectations before a first-time viewing. 'Avatar (2009)' succeeds admirably in many regards, but also disappoints in a few. In a purely technical sense, the film is a masterpiece. Cameron's use of the 3D technology (particularly viewed on the mammoth IMAX screens) isn't gimmicky enough to draw attention to itself, but instead strives to immerse the viewer in the incredible computer- generated landscapes of Pandora, where ferns brush against your face and insects buzz lazily through your field of vision. This is the closest we've got so far to a visceral, immersive cinema experience.<br/><br/>Where I did take issue with 'Avatar' was its screenplay. We know that Cameron is a capable screenwriter – both of the \"Terminator\" films (1984; 1991) and 'True Lies (1994)' were impeccably-scripted action films – but here he traipses a well-worn path. The story, strongly indebted to the story of Pocahantas, and every other cinematic derivative, never (and I really mean never) takes an unexpected course. This painful predictability did inevitably detract from my enjoyment, because one would expect a majestic otherworld like Pandora to be fruitful with unexpected delights, and yet Cameron delivers few. Also, quality science-fiction films are rare nowadays, and I didn't particularly like how 'Avatar' had morphed into full-blown mystic fantasy by its conclusion. I recently rewatched Ridley Scott's 'Alien (1979)' and was entranced by the simple act of exploring a foreign planet; such sequences, too, were the clear highlight of Cameron's film.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Some thoughts on this movie.<br/><br/>First, in many ways, it was very manipulative. The bad guys were painted in the darkest tones, while the aliens and \"nice\" humans were painted in the brightest colors. No one was given any depth. The amusingly named \"Unobtainium\" (Really? Really?) is valuable, but they never tell you for what, or why they are willing to send people across the galaxy to die or kill for it.<br/><br/>Even the character design was pulling the heart strings. Of course, the aliens look like your kitty-kat. Ooooooh, how cute! Meanwhile your mercenaries looked like thugs and rednecks.<br/><br/>The movie telegraphs it's punches so loudly you might as well see the words \"PLOT POINT\" flash across the screens. Like when the alien babe tells the hero that riding the Turok was a big honking deal. Well, you wouldn't be losing any money betting he'd be riding it by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Some point were laughable. Like the mecha that happened to have a big knife as part of the equipment. Okay, it looks cool and all, but what's the practical application of that? Not to mention the tedious pace in parts of the film. Kind of like Titanic when you said, \"Just hit the damned iceberg, already.\" Not a bad film, but really overrated.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">True Blue, baby I love you. Well, I would not go that far but those Cameron crazies are definitely milking the love of James Cameron's long-awaited science fiction phenom \"Avatar\". It is racking in the millions, and will probably sink Cameron's \"Titanic\" as the most profitable film of all time. \"Avatar\" is Cameron's vision of a planet named Pandora inhabited by the Na'vi tribe; a blue-skinned, yellow-eyed humanoid race with their own language, culture, and spirituality. The only difference that \"In The Na'vi\" you cannot put your mind at ease since they exactly do not put up the welcome mats to the general human race. That is where the Avatarados come in! The Avatar program is one where they mix the DNA of humans and Na'vis to convert into the look of a Navi and mechanically zip your way into Pandora's Box. Our \"Avatar\" hero is Jake Sully, a paraplegic war veteran, who in exchange for some legs promised by a ruthless Colonel Quaritch, enters the Avatar program to infiltrate the Na'vi people so the human army can conquer Planet Pandora. Sully however does not follow the Avatar game plan and ends up bonding with the Na'vis and falls in love with the beautiful Na'vette, Neytiri. I guess Neytiri did give Jake some blueballs during their \"whoopee\" session. Anyway, Sully becomes more connected to his Avatar self than his real self. The Army of greedy humans become disconcerted with Jake's Na'vi love and decide to overcome the tribe with grandiose mechanical machines. Jake &amp; the Na'vis are not alone in this fight. Jake also has his Avatar mates to aid him: the Avatar expert scientist Dr. Grace Augustine and the smarty sidekick Norm Spellman. Not to mention the sarcastic female Private Trudy Chacon who rebels against Colonel Quatrich's ruthless antics to eradicate the Na'vi tribe. Director James Cameron's titanic direction of \"Avatar\" is one revolutionary wizardry piece of work that is definitely groundbreaking in the future of the science fiction genre. The film's Art Direction, Cinematography, Make-Up, and Special Effects- not to get too technical, was a technical masterpiece. Sam Worthington as Sully and Zoe Saldana as Neytiri were solid with their starring performances. Worthington was worthy with his sly work and Saldana was not \"killing Zoe\" with her expressive thespian effort. The supporting acting of \"Avatar\" did not make me blue also. Most notably: Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Augustine and Michelle Rodriguez as Chacon. However, the villainous Colonel Quartich was played a bit over the top by Stephen Lang. My only true blue note of \"Avatar\" was Cameron's monotonous screenplay; especially during the Sully &amp; Neytiri so-called love scenes, a bit too Pocahontas-like for my taste. But \"Avatar\" is not primarily about the words is about the vision. And I see you, I mean I see \"Avatar\" as an epical science fiction film that will stand the test of time in the history of motion pictures. **** Good</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">You can't really say more about Avatar that has already been said. However, we will say that it definitely deserves a top spot in your Blu-ray disc library. From the opening space arrival scene to the final battle, this film has it all in terms of a video feast for the eyes and excitement for the ears. Whether watching the 3D or 2D Blu-ray version of this film, the main things to take note of are outstanding black levels (the scene where Jake Sully is trapped in the Jungle at night) and the fantastic color layering in the animals, plants, and landscapes presented in the film.<br/><br/>Also, although the soundtrack isn't the \"hit-em-over-the-head\" variety, it is a great example of well-blended and properly balanced audio mixing, which makes it the perfect complement for the video presentation. Of course, the best way to watch this film is in 3D - the 3D doesn't push you away but draws you into the fantastical world of Pandora that James Cameron created.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Far, far, far too many approach this film as if narrative originality is the sole criteria to judge a film on. It is true that the film has a lot in common with several other Nature's Gentlemen stories released in the past 40 years. The overall film conforms to the Dances with Wolves template. (The special editions, the far stronger cut, even adds a \"buffalo\" hunt) But Jake Sully is no mere Lt. Dunbar clone. Far too many commentators do not take into account that Sully is disabled. Moreover, his disability renders him \"not a man\" in the eyes of the American-sorry Earthican-power structure. This marginalization and Jake's desire to be seen as fully masculine greatly shift much of the tonalities of the narrative. (It does raise a different set of difficulties around disability). So much so that if you think the story is just the Nature's Gentlemen trope you are not paying attention. The film is highly critical of Western civilization and technology from the perspective of many type of people, not just the First People (the obvious analog for the Na'vi). The irony of what the film is about and how it was made of course isn't lost on Cameron and the inattentive viewer will find metacommentary. The story is good; all stories deploy tropes. Avatar is just a bit more obvious in where its narrative ideas come from.<br/><br/>Anyway, qualms about the narrative are largely besides the point. The film is so unbelievably good because it is an experience. I mean this in the sense that a very vivid thunderstorm is an experience. The film stands apart from not only the other films that use the same tropes but other works period. Through the use of absolutely cutting edge and breath taking CGI, exquisite art direction and the director's hand the film is completely immersive the way very few films are. To use a quick example, Cameron sparingly uses POV shots at critical moments, i.e. when getting off the ship for the first time, Jake waking up in the Avatar, which not only highlight Jake's journey but place you in the world of the film. Pandora is so wonderfully realized. I simply cannot wait for the sequels to see more of this stuff.<br/><br/>There is a bluntness to writing-unobtainium, Grace,Selfridge Shock and Awe-that is often mocked but I find that the bluntness fits. The story's anti-colonialism is sadly always relevant. And there is something utterly satisfying watching the Americans-sorry Earthicans-lose to nature for once. The film's politics are hamfisted for sure but how could they not be? The film is all italics and boldness.<br/><br/>This is a truly great film.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Yes, The Day the Earth Stood Still (original) is still probably champ, but this film gives it a run for its money. I had thought James Cameron to be an egotistical meglomaniac when I saw him at the Academy Award ceremonies for Titantic, but I have changed my mind after Avatar. Cameron is a very good writer and director. His sets, special effects, makeup and production values for Avatar are unsurpassed. The acting crew, led by buffed-up Gary Sinese as an all-time heavy is more than competent. Sigorney Weaver, who does her impression of Margaret Mead, the famous anthropologist, does a very credible job as well. The sets are magnificent. As Issac Asimov once said, you can only write good science-fiction if you are able to create a believable environment that surrounds your story. Well, Cameron accomplished that; to his credit. Philosophically, however, the film is much deeper than the eye candy that we behold for almost two hours. Ultimately, this film is a tragedy or triumph, depending on your life view. Man vs. Science and Nature is an eternal struggle. It appears as if Nature wins this one, but there is plenty of precedent for Nature getting clobbered by Science and Man in the history of Mankind. The American Indian, who should have slaughtered the first settlers of the American continent made a fatal mistake and allowed them to live alongside them. Ultimately, these invaders destroyed the American Indian and its culture. The same could be said for ancient man; evolution generally wipes out any previous edition that has basic flaws. But is that nature or science?\n",
       " There were sequences in the film that were reminiscent of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, The Last Samurai, Star Wars, Mutiny on the Bounty, and Full Metal Jacket. An animated film, Forbidden Planet, also came to mind. The Vietnam War (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Go Tell the Spartans) also had parallels. The Iraq occupation has parallels. Haleburton, anyone? There are political considerations. Conservative hard-liners might favor the colonists. Liberals would naturally tend to favor the natives. But Nature has no political alliance. Nature overcomes all political and religious beliefs. There is no need to go any further than Deep Impact to realize that scenario (the bad one, not the lucky one). Or Sunshine (once again, bad scenario, not the lucky one). Science and man are always destined to lose to nature the vast majority of times. Occasionally, science and man wins, but those wins are only temporary. Nature always wins in the end.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I don't give a rip if people \"Find this helpful\"<br/><br/>Not that I didn't totally enjoy this movie, or Terminator before it, but James Cameron needs to do one little thing: Add a writing credit to this film that says \"Based Upon the short story 'Call me Joe' by Poul Anderson\". And maybe even a CO-AUTHOR credit - Because Cameron snagged LARGE amounts of plot - Maybe even some dialogue! How could Cameron do this and NOT know that science fiction readers would NOT recognise a World-Class, Hugo-Award winning story? Even the original \"Day the Earth Stood Still\" gave credit to the Harry Bates story \"Farewell to the Master\" and THAT was not even as highly recognised as \"Call Me Joe\" is, 53 years after it was written.<br/><br/>Avatar does not simply use little elements of that short story, ut blatantly uses major plot elements including the very end. These things were NOT created by James Cameron, they were created by a science fiction writer named POUL ANDERSON and these things were created not in 2009 but in 1957. If Cameron thinks that he can just DO this thing and people will not say anything about it, he's mistaken! I know he used it, many other people know it and Cameron himself knows it because practically everything that is in the short story has been either used outright, or referred to in the film.<br/><br/>Anybody who has read the Anderson work and then seeing this film, can not afterward say that \"This is a Coincidence\" or \"Cameron has just borrowed a few of the things from that story\" - No, Nope. Let's list the basic things which are similar:<br/><br/>1) A ruined person is given a job \"driving\" another body.<br/><br/>2) This body gives him full use of his legs - The \"Driver\" is Exhilarated, enjoying his new body as MUCH as possible, even razzing his superiors. But the man, who in the story is named Ernest Anglsey, is chiefly most interested in one thing: Survival. This parallels the film in every way possible.<br/><br/>3) The ruined person's actual body rapidly deteriorates while the \"avatar\" or in the case of the story, \"PsuedoJovian\" body gets stronger - This is a MAJOR Plot element used in the film!<br/><br/>4) Eventually the ruined man's brain has been moved compleately INTO the PsuedoJovian body!<br/><br/>5) In \"Call Me Joe\" - this story takes place on a moon of Jupiter and on the Surface of Jupiter. In \"Avatar\" - The planet \"Pandora\" revolves around a SuperJovian\"<br/><br/>There had to be a PROCESS where this could happen, in \"Call Me Joe\", the machine in which the ruined guy sits is getting feedback from the brain of the \"PsuedoJovian\" and wrecking part of the machine, a \"K-Tube\" - In this regard \"Avatar\" is changed from \"Call Me Joe\" - In which a Technician is sent to investigate why the K-Tubes are failing. This includes a two-year jaunt in 'Frozen Sleep\" from Earth to Jupiter, just like how \"Avatar\" begins, with Sully taking a 5-year trip in Frozen Sleep. Still not convinced? The Short story is told as a narrative by the technician, \"Avatar\" is told in a narrative by Sully. The technician \"Cornelius\" is baffled, but eventually discovers this: It turns out that Anglsey had been \"writing\" himself into the empty Pseudo Jovian Brain the entire time, a brain that was made better than a human brain. So in the end of Call Me Joe, the man discards, happily, his old ruined body - The doctors said he went out with a smile on his face. And this is the EXACT Ending of \"Avatar\" Cameron took this storyline, and created a Planet that could store a human mind, a planet where every living thing can biologically interface with every other living thing. Because the TREES are a hive mind of some sort? Not that I do not admit that I like the things Cameron did with this story, but he SHOULD have given Poul Anderson DIRECT credit for this, because as much as I wanted to believe that this was a total coincidence, I cannot believe it NOW after watching this film, Cameron had to have deliberately used it.<br/><br/>Now regarding the FILM all I can say is WOW and I apologies for having to include that previous spoiler: it is a very good film, and I would have loved to seen it in 3-D. Seriously, the only thing that annoyed me was Cameron's use of the story without giving credit - The Imagery is Fantastic.<br/><br/>It is hard to imagine a planet that lights up at night, it is hard to imagine Live Action blended with an eerie PIXAR style of animation. The earth-based things, people, ships, guns, all LOOK like they are from Earth, but the things that are from Pandora, look like they come from Pandora, especially when the two things are shown together. James Horner creates a great score using elements from Aliens, Titanic and Enemy at the Gates.<br/><br/>My Favourite shot is when the Shuttle is first descending into the pit on Pandora, we do not understand the size of the pit until the next shot which reveals a MASSIVE machine digging up the ground.<br/><br/>Cameron says a lot about ecology in this film, he shows us the conflict between \"corporate\" and \"scientific\" and the resulting atrocities that occur. This has even occurred in the US, in our treatment of our Indigenous Population. Most of the things we use for energy today, were life forms in the past - And this concept it explored in the Avatar material \"Unobtanium\" - Named so because it probably cannot be obtained.<br/><br/>Regardless of Cameron's use of a classic short story without crediting it, I highly enjoyed this. But if Cameron is thinking of any return trips to Pandora, he needs a return trip to the United States Copyright office.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is that rare film where everything you ever hear about it is absolutely true. All the criticism is valid and all the praise is justified. It really is the sibling of James Cameron's Titanic, in that it is a very ordinary story presented in an extraordinary fashion. Your opinion of it will be determined by whether you care about what a movie has to say or how it says it.<br/><br/>Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a crippled Marine in a future where a corporation has established a mining colony on the alien world of Pandora. Jake's twin brother was part of the Avatar program, where human beings have their minds projected into genetically engineered bodies that resemble the natives of Pandora, 10 foot tall blue humanoids called the Na'vi. The idea is that by presenting themselves in similar forms, they can more successfully interact with the Na'vi. When Jake's brother dies, the wheelchair-bound Marine is offered the chance to take his place because only someone with his brother's DNA can \"drive\" his alien form.<br/><br/>When Jake arrives on Pandora and jumps into his Na'vi body, he finds himself caught between the scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), who wants Jake to help her learn about the aliens and their world, and Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who wants Jake to get him militarily useful intelligence on the Na'vi. The head of the mining colony, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) doesn't care a whit about Jake, he just wants the Na'vi to leave their homes so he can dig up a mineral called Unobtainium which is worth 20 million dollars a kilo.<br/><br/>You may have heard Avatar described as \"Dances with Wolves in space\". Well, that's a pretty fair characterization as the rest of the movie is all about Jake becoming part of the Na'vi, learning their ways, falling in love with a female named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and eventually siding with the aliens in spectacular battle against the humans that are trying to exploit Pandora for their own needs.<br/><br/>The computer generated images of Avatar are the most extensive and best looking stuff that's ever been on the silver screen. The scenery is incredibly detailed and realistic. The Pandoran wildlife and the Na'vi themselves are phenomenally lifelike. The advanced technology of the humans, like their Battletech-style armored suits, are more clearly defined and believably designed than anything you've seen before. And unlike some films where the CGI action sequences turn into little more than blurs of color and motion, Cameron is able to slow things down and keep things clear so you can follow what's happening in even the most dynamic moments. Watching this entire film is like the first time you saw the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park or the morphing T-1000 from Terminator 2.<br/><br/>Now, the verisimilitude of computerized special effects doesn't really blow me away. I certainly enjoyed looking at Avatar, but I generally need more than that and I just barely got it from this movie. This is an extremely formulaic and pedestrian story. There's nothing boring or stupid about it and if you took away all the CGI effects, this script wouldn't have made a bad film. It just wouldn't have ever been made into a film because there's nothing interesting or compelling about the tale Cameron has written. In fact, there are a couple of points where it seems like Cameron deliberately avoided more complex and potentially engaging story possibilities. I'm not sure if he wanted to keep the story as dumbed down as possible or if he simply focused too much on the special effects, but this is probably the least dramatically ambitious tale Cameron has ever told.<br/><br/>Avatar is a fun, exciting film to watch. I can recommend it with no reservations\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is a science fiction movie directed by James Cameron and stars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Giovanni Rabisi and Michelle Rodriguez.<br/><br/>Visually this is one of the most beautiful movie I've seen but the viewers who are expecting as strong plot as visuals might be disappointed.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is quite simple and very predictable and we might have seen similar plots in different types of movies although the execution is different in this movie as it shows the relationship between human and Na'vi a species from a distant planet called Pandora. The Na'vi are shown pretty much like humans and the animals are also pretty similar to the animals on earth but the only difference is that they are more closer to their mother land and humans are there just for the greed.<br/><br/>The plot as mentioned earlier doesn't excite much but credit should be given to the development of Na'vi species and their language. Screenplay is average but with beautiful cinematography you will be engaged to it. Acting is good and action and stunts are the another strong talking point of the movie. Background music is superb.<br/><br/>If you are fan of science fiction movies then this is the movie for you. I am sure you will fall in love with the great visuals and superb cinematography of the movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Set in the mid-22nd century the military are overseeing the mining a precious mineral on a moon called Pandora, however the expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi—a. This causes a hostility between the locals, the science devision and armed forces as they have a conflict of interest.<br/><br/>Zoe Saldana (Star Trek)as Neytiri is fantastic, as usual Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation) is well cast in a strong lead role. Giovanni Ribisi, Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez's brief appearances are welcomed. Also Stephen Lang, as the tough Colonel Miles Quaritch gives a great performance. It is a visual spectacular with great acting and effects. <br/><br/>It's a moralistic tale, of following orders or protecting an alien world. However, the story is lazy, reminiscent Cameron's own Aliens, Dances with Wolves, Apocalypto and Pocahontas to name a few. It mirrors Custers last stand, Vietnam and many other conflicts throughout history. <br/><br/>While the effects in creating the moon Pandora are mind-blowing, the lack of originality leaves you disappointed. I'm sure teenagers will love it, it's the perfect money maker. James Cameron is a fantastic director and is instrumental in pushing industry movie techniques forward. However, in all the special CGI effects the great writer Cameron appears to have forgotten about his older fans, who wanted a meatier, original and complex story.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Hype can be a very dangerous thing. Though it is a valuable marketing tool, it can also raise expectations to a point beyond which it becomes quite inevitable that the film in question will disappoint at least on one level. In the case of Avatar, promises of a new, \"revolutionary\" film-making style came along with the fact that for an entire generation of film-lovers - i.e. those who were born in the '90s - James Cameron is a genius, but also the pompous buffoon who proclaimed himself \"King of the world\" when Titanic broke box-office records and won 11 Oscars (some of which should have gone to L.A. Confidential). This time, however, the hype was entirely justified: Avatar, Cameron's first feature project in 12 years, is indeed an amazing achievement.<br/><br/>Returning to his genre of choice, namely science-fiction, the director takes us to a new world, named Pandora, an ideal place for colonization in a future where most of Earth's resources have run out (a subtle social commentary?). Since the air on Pandora is toxic to humans, interactions with the indigenous population, called Na'vi, are made easier thanks to \"avatars\": artificial human-Na'vi hybrids remotely controlled by selected members of a science program. One of these people is Jake Sully (a charismatic Sam Worthington), a crippled Marine who signs up for the gig when promised a chance to be able to walk again. His pragmatism takes a step back, however, when he learns to appreciate the lifestyle of the blue, huge, feline-shaped Na'vi and falls for one of them, the beautiful Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). Problems begin when it becomes clear corporations and military (represented by Giovanni Ribisi and Stephen Lang) don't care about the inhabitants, only the planet's resources. Which side will Jake choose?<br/><br/>Yes, the story isn't very original: part Dances with Wolves, part Pocahontas, it's a classic Western film subject in a sci-fi environment. But it's also pure Cameron: man versus technology (ironic, given the director's penchant for pushing the technical envelope on every movie he makes), strong female characters (Saldana, Michelle Rodriguez and Ripley herself, aka Sigourney Weaver), tragic love (although the two blue creatures kissing gets close to ridiculous), James Horner's epic score (complete with a song over the end credits), grandiose battles. As is often the case, what matters is not what kind of story the director tells, but how he does it.<br/><br/>And how does Cameron do it? He takes us to strange, new worlds with an energy and a passion reminiscent of Peter Jackson (Pandora does look a bit like Middle Earth in places), providing a feast for the eyes without ever losing track of the story. To achieve this, he personally developed a new 3D camera and waited over a decade for visual effects to be sufficiently evolved. His patience is well rewarded: instead of the usual \"object being thrown at you\" effect that is associated with 3D movies, his use of the technology allows one to totally embrace his creation, thanks to a unique sense of depth that gives the impression one actually is there with the characters. Naturally, the third dimension adds extra spectacle come the massive final showdown (which packs a neat Aliens reference, thus uniting the two Camerons - guerrilla auteur and ambitious blockbuster-maker), but the focus is always on setting and characters first, action second.<br/><br/>Avatar is an important film, a fundamental achievement in the entertainment industry. Its existence doesn't mark the death of traditional film-making (honestly, who would want to watch Bergman or Godard in 3D?), but it is a new, exciting side of the art of bringing stories to the big screen. Make no mistake: this is a film that has to be seen in cinemas, and for once, the extra dimension makes all the difference.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">¨They've sent us a message...that they can take whatever they want. Well we will send them a message. That this...this is our land¨ James Cameron's Avatar is a film that took 15 years in the making. It was a project that was really close to Cameron and he waited for the right time to be able to release this movie. He payed close attention to every detail and perfected the way we see movies in 3D. The effort was not cheap as this film is reported to be the most expensive movie ever made. Avatar will mark a before and after in film history for special effects and 3D. All the critics agree that this film is visually stunning and there is no doubt it will win several awards for special effects and art direction. I don't think it will win as much awards as Titanic (Cameron's last film) did or even match it's record breaking box office, but it will be remembered for all the technical and visual breakthroughs. One thing is for sure, it will not win any acting awards. James Cameron has proved in Hollywood that he is a great director and that he is on par with Spielberg when it comes to special effects. He has directed several blockbuster movies such as Aliens, Terminator, Titanic, and now Avatar is becoming a hit worldwide. Visually speaking this movie deserves ten stars, but the story is not up to par with the visuals. Moviegoers who enjoy great special effects and visuals will be blown away by this movie, but fans who enjoy good storytelling and writing will leave unimpressed by Cameron's effort. I am more into the storytelling so for me this movie dragged for long periods of times and the plot was very predictable. I felt like I was at an art museum looking at all these famous masterpieces, but I wasn't entertained throughout the two and a half hours. I felt good about the visuals and they were truly remarkable, but I didn't walk out of the theater impressed. I remember when Spielberg's Jurrasic Park came out and that experience was much more breathtaking than this one. I guess I wasn't blown away by Avatar and I would find it difficult to sit through two and a half hours to watch this movie again.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, Avatar takes place in the future (2154 to be exact) in a planet named Pandora. Pandora has a rich and extensive fauna and the natives that inhabit it (known as the Na'vis) are very connected to this nature and even worship the mother tree as their god. Humans have set a military base in the planet because it is rich in a new type of mineral or chemical element, a gray rock which happens to sell for 200 million a kilo. This mineral happens to be under the surface where the Na'vis live so a group of scientists have tried to fit in with the natives by creating avatars which are alien bodies controlled through human minds (an approach we have seen before similar to The Matrix or Surrogates). These avatars are controlled by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver who has already worked with Cameron in Aliens), Jake Sully (Sam Worthington, the Australian actor who starred in this year's Terminator film), and Norm Spellman (Joel Moore who is known for his comedic role in Dodgeball). Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex marine, is accepted by the tribe and begins to learn from their culture thanks in most part to the beautiful Neytiri (Zoe Saldana who had a role in this year's Star Trek) the tribe chief's daughter who teaches him how to connect with the environment and all he needs to know in order to survive in the jungle's of Pandora. Jake begins to have mixed feelings towards the natives and towards his commanders, Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang, Public Enemies) who has promised to give him the money for the spinal surgery for the exchange of information, and Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) the greedy corporate boss in charge of the mission. From this point on one cannot help but compare the plot to Pocahontas. It is just an alien version of the New World. Avatar becomes very predictable and we know what is going to happen, but fans are not into this for the plot, the audience is here for the visual spectacle.<br/><br/>The film might be disappointing plot wise, but the special effects make up for it. As I said before, those film buffs that are into movies for the storytelling will probably be a little unhappy with Avatar like I was, but those who are into the visuals and special effects will leave this film with a huge smile on their faces. There is no doubt James Cameron has spent the money wisely and created an entire new world with a beautiful scenery and some cool creatures. The first hour and a half dragged a little, but once we get to the last hour with the battle scenes the movie really picks up. The final battle is one of the greatest action sequences in film on par with the Star Wars saga, or The Lord of The Ring franchise, or even the Matrix trilogy. However, Avatar took a little too long to get to this point as it had to introduce us to this new planet. Don't get me wrong, Avatar is a good movie, but I think there are other films that are much better than this one to be considered in my top 10 list of 2009. I was a little disappointed because all of the hype this movie was receiving.</div>,\n",

Is this where people would have got from sleeping with the cows and sharing disease with the pigs through feces?<br/><br/>Overall the script is shallow and puerile. The characters are all stock characters from the blue Pocahontas to the war mongerer with three scars.<br/><br/>The acting is so and so. But I can't blame the actors. The usual White European unimaginative story. Looking down at the natives and at the same time looking up at the noble savage. So what can you act on Star Wars dialogue?<br/><br/>Which brings me to the design. If I would have seen this one back in 2009 maybe I would have been impressed. Or not. In 2018 it was boring. Many games have better graphics and I can go where I please, not where the director asked.<br/><br/>And the animals? Well. Jurassic Park meet some other boring fantasy film. On a remote planet, where the atmosphere does not even seem to be right for humans, the WHOLE EXISTENCE is identical with the life of Pocahontas, as imagined by the \"superior\" White intellect. The \"savages\" have horses and ride them well. Oh! They even have bows and arrows!<br/><br/>Compared with the work put into Jurassic Park to gather some resemblance with the real dinosaurs, this one is laughable.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Okay so I wanna talk for a minute about James Cameron. James Cameron is one of my all time favorite filmmakers ever, he is proven to be a true master at directing films. Look at his body of work and you shall see, it really speaks for itself. Avatar is a masterpiece in many ways to me. There's the amazing special effects and visuals that were so revolutionary back at the time of it's release in 2009. And those visuals really are incredible, seeing Pandora and all it's illustriousness is so enchanting. The effects pull you in, and the talented actors keep you interested in the captivating story. The actors really do a great job here, Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, and Michelle Rodriguez all give it their all here. The characters are likable and the film makes you care about them and root for them. The story is kinda predictable i guess, meaning there aren't a whole lot of big twists, but that's ok by me because the film is done in such a magnificent way that it doesn't need anything like that. Bottom line: this is a great story told by talented actors and illustrated with spectacular visual effects. There are also moments of real emotion here, and that's due to the depth in the characters. I 100% recommend Avatar to any and everyone! I'm so excited for these sequels!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Amazing special effects and nothing more. It's long pretty dull story which is suspiciously similar to Pocahontas. James Cameron is getting worse and worse with his movies. He used to make amazing movies, even his old action movies had strong plots.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron had not directed any movie since being the \"King of the World\" after \"Titanic\" in 1998. This big movie \"Avatar\" is certainly more than an worthy comeback project to again re-launch Mr. Cameron back into filmdom's firmament.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer some months ago, I admit that I was not entirely enticed to catch this film. Lately though, the film had been garnering nominations and wins for Best Picture in some year-end award giving bodies, including the Golden Globes. And finally, I was lucky enough to win two free tickets to a special invitational 3D screening tonight, so there was no question that I would watch this. And wow, I am sure glad that I did.<br/><br/>Truth to tell, the basic story is not entirely new as we have seen it in various incarnations in so many previous movies. However, the grand imaginative vision of Mr. James Cameron is what elevated this piece into the masterpiece that it is. We are effectively transported to a whole new time (in the 22nd century) and planet (called Pandora), with plant and animal life the likes of which we have never seen before.<br/><br/>The magical effect of 3D was put to good effect in the whole movie. From the amazingly big battle scenes to quiet scenes, the 3D drew us into this alien place as more than a mere spectator. I found it hard to imagine watching this film in regular 2D. The extra money you would pay to enjoy the 3D is very much worth it.<br/><br/>The acting of the humans and the aliens were all very good. Clearly standing out are the good guys led by Sam Worthington (very convincing as both the crippled Marine Jake Sully and his alien Avatar) and Sigourney Weaver (as his mentor and leader of the Avatar project, Dr. Grace Augustine). On the alien side, female characters like Zoe Saldana's Neytiri and CCH Pounder's Moat stand out. The bad guys were a bit on the cardboard side, one dimensional in their wanton greed and evil machinations.<br/><br/>This film is definitely a front-runner in the award season in the next few months. It is clearly the leader in the field of Visual Effects. Cameron reportedly conceived this project back in 1994, but only pushed through now when the technology to realize his vision had been developed, and how! We the audience are also effectively drawn into the heart that beats within the story, and get caught up in the adrenaline rush of the action along the way. This is told as only James Cameron can. Indeed, he is back!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">As a director, James Cameron dazzles magnificently with his green-friendly 2009 mega-opus. As his first full-fledged feature since \"Titanic\", it's a CGI-generated extravaganza of 3-D and motion-capture technologies that overwhelms the senses. Give him credit for making a film that runs an epic-length 162 minutes without a hint of a yawn in the visual execution. However, as a screenwriter, Cameron resorts to familiar clichés and often corny dialogue in this unwieldy amalgamation of \"Land of the Lost\" and \"Dancing with Wolves\". Character development and original dialogue have never been his strong suits, and fortunately, these shortcomings are not as pronounced as they were with \"Titanic\". At the same time, I really wish he could have seen the benefit of a writing collaborator who could have made something more provocative out of the arresting science-fantasy premise and ultimately push this movie toward the echelon of being one for the ages.<br/><br/>Set in 2154, the fanciful story focuses on Jake Scully, a paraplegic former Marine who has been recruited for a special mission by the U. S. Armed Forces because he's a genetic match for his dead identical twin. The mission is to Pandora, an earth-sized moon in orbit around a massive star, which gives life to minerals that the Earth needs after centuries of abuse and desecration. Pandora's native inhabitants deep in the planetary forest are the blue-skinned Na'vi, a race of slender, agile twelve-foot giants who are at one with their natural environment. In order for humans to connect with the Na'vi, avatars have been created from their DNA, which allows select humans to become Na'vi look-alikes on Pandora, while still being mind-controlled by the original humans wired up on the hovering ship. Physically, there is no difference between the avatars and the Na'vi, but their inner selves reflect a great divide in sensibilities and priorities of which only Scully seems to know how to traverse the deep spiritual chasm.<br/><br/>From that premise comes the inevitable love story (Scully falls for the brave, soulful Neytiri) and of course, the equally inevitable showdown between the Na'vi and the increasingly aggressive military forces led by the gung-ho Colonel Miles Quaritch. The similarities between the peace-loving Na'vi and Native Americans are purely intentional down to the earthly wisdom and the yelping battle cries. Horses have been replaced with pterodactyl-like flying creatures with which the Na'vi connect through intriguingly sensual tubes of dancing cilia. There are other layers of allegory, but Cameron focuses more on the story's visceral thrills rather than bothering to elucidate the government's motivation behind the avatar program, especially since the program director, Dr. Grace Augustine, appears completely out of sync with the corporate-military brain trust almost from the outset. It's pretty clear that none of these nuances matter once the climactic battle occurs, a genuinely masterful sequence that brings the digital technology to a whole new level.<br/><br/>For a movie like this to work, the characters are merely presented to support the action and supply a recognizable set of emotions which an audience doesn't have to think about. Toward that end, the cast is effective in a workman-like manner. Sam Worthington (\"Terminator Salvation\") plays Scully appropriately like a young Clint Eastwood type, never complicating the character more than Cameron allows. Zoe Saldaña's (\"Star Trek\") role consists primarily of digital performance capture since her character doesn't have a human counterpart. She lends a palpable voice to Neytiri even though the Na'vi facial expressions remind me of those of the aliens at the end of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". Michelle Rodriguez (\"Fast &amp; Furious\") is on the sidelines playing a too-cool Marine fighter pilot, and there are predictably villainous turns by Stephen Lang (\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\") as Quaritch and Giovanni Ribisi (\"The Gift\") as a corporate administrator pushing relentlessly for the mining operation. Sigourney Weaver, who starred in Cameron's \"Aliens\" 23 years earlier, contributes a few, sassy scene-stealing scenes as Grace. James Horner's bombastic music score will sound familiar to \"Titanic\" fans down to the treacly ballad sung Celine-style by Leona Lewis. Mauro Fiore's cinematography and the elaborate production design led by Rick Carter and Robert Stromberg reflect world-class work.</div>,\n",

Half way through, I realized I already wanted to see it again. I saw it in 3D by which I did get exhausted and had a headache the next day, eye strain etc, but I actually put that down to the cinema film projection ... so next time I will see an actual digital presentation as opposed to a film presentation. Friends who saw it digital projection said how sharp it was. Yes AVATAR is a massive leap forward in tech excellence and I applaud Cameron again for delivering on the hype. Fox must stand in awe of him as much as savvy audiences do. I was a converted fan from THE ABYSS onwards, and TITANIC was massive, but this film is simply a colossal achievement. AVATAR is setting a new benchmark for cinema and I am thrilled to see it brand new in my cinema-going lifetime. From FANTASIA to FERN GULLY to APOLCALYPSE NOW and POCAHONTAS, it is all there but amped up to a jaw-dropping visual level unseen creatively on a screen before.

Undoubtedly this movie will win the Academy Award for special effects, and it deserves this hand down, but this is not Cameron's best picture. This is a cool looking film full of many cardboard characters, clichés, and predictability. Not to say this movie's only positive aspect is the visuals, it's actually very entertaining and is overall a good movie, but in no way is this a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic ex-marine who is taking his deceased twin brother's place in a scientific/military experiment on a moon of Pandora. Using the DNA of himself and a native creature of the land, the N'avi, an avatar of himself as a N'avi is made which he can control through a machine. From controlling this creature he will learn the N'avi's home in the forest in order to figure out where a rare element, Unobtanium, is in their forest. Of course he soon becomes attached to the N'avi over the humans, and chaos ensues.<br/><br/>I can see how this movie can be called revolutionary. The special effects are the best I've ever seen on characters. The creatures and the planet and everything character and design wise is very imaginative. The planet's inhabitants are quite a visual treat, and that's really the main thing this movie has to boast.<br/><br/>This movie can't be called original, as the plot is completely recycled from many other films. If you've seen the Disney cartoon Pocohantas, than you already know the plot to this one. Not to say that it ruins the film that this is very similar to Pocohantas, Ferngully or dozens of other movies, it just adds a level of predictability to the story. In addition to the story, the dialogue in this movie is quite boring. Most action films have at least a little bit of humor, but this has so close to none it's ridiculous. Sigourney Weaver is mildly comedic when she's mean to Jake, and he's mildly comedic in his fish out of water routine, but there is no clever or funny dialogue in this.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has it's flaws, but it is an entertaining and great looking film. The problem is the plot and dialogue play second to the visuals which is what I'm assuming is drawing in these huge crowds, that and James Cameron's name. Definitely not Cameron's best, but it proves again how he can create new lands and places that can still wow an audience.<br/><br/>My rating *** out of ****. 162 mins. PG-13 for violence, sensuality and some language.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron does learn from his previous efforts and keeps getting better and better, and he has come close to achieving perfection in his latest production, the marvelous and wonderful \"Avatar\", a film with non stop energy that entertains, teaches, and delights us. Though not completely original, the film shines because its elements all fit into place and take us through experiences which will probably never be matched or surpassed in the silver screen.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" is the story of the conflicts between two worlds, one protecting his idyllic environment where everything has a connection to an unifying force and spirit, and another one that continues to self destruct by greed and lack of insight. As we are introduced to the wonders of Pandora, an ironic name if any, the wonders begin. Cameron has given us sights and creations of amazing imagination, with the fauna and flora that parades in front of our eyes, fantastic beings with much more life in them than most of any previous CGI creatures, come to mind the dinosaurs and gorillas of \"Jurassic Park\" and \"King Kong\", but the new animals show more force and agility, and what takes our breath away is how real their interaction appears to be.<br/><br/>The crowning jewel are the humanoids native to Pandora, tall and proud blue skinned beings, lovingly rendered by computer programs that rely heavily on the performances of the cast. A million years ahead of the work done with similar process by Zemeckis in the disturbing \"Polar Express\" and \"Christmas Carol\", the people from Pandora manage to express their emotions quite eloquently, and those emotions range from jealousy to heartbreak. Most incredible work is done by Worthington and Saldana, as the central couple who must learn to understand and appreciate each other.<br/><br/>Humand eventually try to encroach over the people of Pandora's natural resources, by any means necessary, and a epic battle results because of the destruction of secret sites in order to break the natives' spirits. These are powerful scenes, full of an intensity rarely seen in epic/fantasy films, and the last hour of the film delivers what has sorely been missing from the latest entries by Scott in \"Kingdom of Heaven\" and Stone's \"Alexander\", a vibrant and powerful collection of physical confrontations where survival is the key element, spectacle is mixed with sheer will and determination, and the results are magnificent.<br/><br/>Finally, I can't heap enough praise upon this sensation movie, the best of 2009, one that is as powerful as \"Departures\", as imaginative and entertaining as \"Star Trek\", full of some of the wonder of \"Up\", and with great performances that recalls the amazing work of Robin Williams in the \"World's Greatest Dad\" and Jessica Biel's and Kristin Scott-Thomas in \"Easy Virtue\", films that like \"Avatar\" are worth a second or third viewing because they aim and hit their respective targets because of their pure cinematic power. How does one know that a film will become a classic? When one leave the theatre and can't wait to see it again for the sum of its parts, not by misreading the power of a single performance and hoping the luster will compensate for the mediocrity of the rest of the film, or by hoping that a set of clever lines will turn a screenplay into gold. Cameron has made sure \"Avatar\"'s separate parts all work in tune, from its performances, to its screenplay, to its editing, and special effects, never forgetting that what matters the most is the fact that its heart beats with enough conviction to connect to the sense of wonder in all of us. A great film.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Recap: Mankind has gone for the stars and found a treasure of the rare material Unobtanium in the planet Pandora. Covered by a beautiful but deceptively dangerous jungle a big part of the human colony is security forces, and that is how disabled veteran marine Jake Sully ends up there. Going in place of his dead brother he operates an Avatar to reach out to the humanoid native species, the Na'vi. The Na'vi is in extreme touch with nature, depends and protects it at any cost, and it is soon clear that their interest comes in clear conflict with the humans' greedy mining intentions. And of course, Jake ends up in the middle of this, feeling more and more sympathy for the awe inspiring nature, and finding love with the Na'vi.<br/><br/>Comments: Despite not seeing this in 3D, but only on a Bluray, this still is stunningly beautiful picture with marvelous sceneries, landscapes and vistas, not to mention wonderful details. It is instantly obvious that this is a movie heavy in the visual experience. And despite coming with heavy praise, it doesn't disappoint even though some scenes are clearly solely there to impress 3D-watchers. Still, many scenes are just breathtaking. It is a marvel of light and colour in the hands of a playful, imaginative mind (or more probably, minds). Most impressive, and most entertaining.<br/><br/>But the danger with movies becoming so heavily focused on the visual and effects part is that the story might be somewhat forgotten, or at least having to take the back seat. Avatar, along with 2012 for example, suffers from this. In Avatar's case a very big part of the framework of the story is almost copy-pasted from an old western movie, complete with stereotypes of the evil white ranchers and the primitive but in touch with nature natives. It annoyed me that a movie with such a big budget, and made with such an enormous effort couldn't be more original than that. However, a cliché is often a cliché for a reason, and in this case it is because it provides a simple story with a clear conflict to exploit with stunning effects.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington has quickly established himself as a lead man in action movies. And with good support from Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldana, Michelle Roudrigez, Stephen Lang and Joel Moore, among many others, there is absolutely nothing to complain about the cast, or their performances.<br/><br/>In all, Avatar was a refreshingly good movie. Long as it is, something is always happening or there is something breathtaking to watch, it is entertaining every minute, even if predictable. It is a real treat, and I'm thankful that once in a while someone sets their mind's to make an epic film like Avatar (and note that is almost always a sci-fi). Highly recommended, and would have been a full-pointer if there would have been just a little more effort on a more original script.<br/><br/>8/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">At this point, the smothering hype machine has told you all you really need to know about \"Avatar,\" James Cameron's much-anticipated return to the cinematic fray. Insofar as visual impact is concerned, this could very well be the crowning achievement of 2009 (and certainly an apt way to end the first decade of the new millennium), with a literal world of intricate detail on display, populated by characters and creatures that run the gamut from beautiful anthropomorphs to grotesque hybrids of prehistoric creatures. When viewed in 3D, \"Avatar\" is nothing short of breathtaking, and forgives much of the film's storytelling shortcomings: the bottom line is, this is a simple plot (the military-industrial complex wants some precious/valuable resource from an indigenous population; said population is not going to give it up without a fight) that is not new, and often monotonously stretched through a series of anticlimaxes until it settles on a proper ending. While there is a stinging indictment of human greed and military intervention on display, it's nothing we haven't seen before in the post-9/11 cinematic climate (and granted, Cameron--who also wrote the script--has always worked better with conceptual ideas than narrative intricacies). Yet \"Avatar,\" while heavy-handed in its telling, is less about a message and more about the experience overall; I was frequently taken aback and awed by the imagery on display, and in a medium that (at its best) demands we be shown, and not told, what's going on, \"Avatar\" is about as good as it gets.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the year 2154, Jake Sully, a crippled marine, is sent to the hostile planet Pandora to be part of the Avatar Program. The object is to gain the trust of the indigenous Na'vi people by using mind-operated genetically-engineered Na'vi bodies. Jake befriends the local clan but finds he is caught between the free-spirited, ecologically minded Na'vi and his human masters, who want to exploit Pandora for its mineral worth. Which side will he choose ? <br/><br/>Like most of Cameron's films, Avatar is not so much a movie as a phenomenal event, and that's not necessarily a good thing. It is a good movie though, full of incredible vistas and amazing mo-cap CG work, driven along by a great story and heartfelt characterisations. Pandora looks just stunning, packed full of amazing greenery, incredible creatures, rich colours and a jaw-dropping sense of depth; so many scenes involve cliffs, mountains and huge spaces, contrasted with dense undergrowth, fragile flowers and pin-points of light. The Na'vi too look amazing - giant but elfin creatures irrevocably linked to the earth and the sky, dignified and powerful yet also vulnerable. The photography and James Horner's rich music really create a majestic sense of place and space. The cast are also first-rate - unknown Worthington is great in the lead, managing the always difficult character arc of someone switching allegiance with subtlety and skill. Saldana, whilst only ever appearing in animation, demonstrates well how far this technology has come, as all the nuances of her performance are reflected in the visual effects. Jobbing tough guy Lang has the role of a lifetime as the jarhead villain, Rodriguez is good as always, and Weaver is terrific as the heroic Dr Augustine, reuniting with Cameron twenty-three years after Aliens. If the movie has a weakness, for me it's the plot, which is more than a little reminiscent of some classic sf novels, particularly Dune, and there are some points it glosses over just a little too conveniently - how exactly do the humans make the Avatar bodies, complete with a neural-network plug-in hair extension ? The movie was extremely successful, winning three Academy Awards, many other accolades and grossing around three billion dollars to become perhaps the most financially successful film ever. In some senses this is great because it is a visually stunning and beautifully constructed picture, but in a way it's also disappointing because an obscene amount was spent on its production and promotion and its focus on extremely expensive technology is, I believe, counter-productive to healthy and dynamic filmmaking. But it's still a must-see movie, brilliantly written and directed by Cameron, and packed with amazing scenes and images which linger in the mind long after the screen has gone dark.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron, twelve years after directing \"Titanic\", knows how to take risks. He even outdo his own film back in 1997. To become the world's, including North America's, highest grossing film of all time. Plus introduced us to 3-D, IMAX, and the new but very popular 4D that will outdo even 3D to come! You have to see this on the big screen to see what I mean. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see it on the big screen. But heard it was something else. Not only does it have action but also a plot. And good vs evil. You also begin to like these characters that develop throughout the movie. As well as dislike the others that are the antagonists. The members of the Navi, are mainly peaceful people who don't like or want to fight. But feel if their place, meaning Pandora is in trouble. Then they will fight for it. And they distrust humans except for the very few. The humans that want to take Pandora down. Will stop at nothing to do so. As a heroic former Marine, paralyzed but in an Avatar body, can walk and do everything. Is caught in the middle of a war between trust with the Na'vi and following his duties. But slowly but surely, he gains the trust of the Na'vi and falls in love with the daughter of the clan leader. Despite trying to hide his reason reason, when given his orders and possibly to gain back his legs in order to do so. Movie is touching, a bit funny, action, and romance. Plus drama in between. JC takes risk, and there is a possibility of more sequels in the future that would develop in the Na'vi. But they won't begin until 2014, but hopefully it will begin sooner rather than in 2014. Can't wait for more as hopefully JC &amp; Company will hurry it up!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Is this the greatest movie ever made? Well, no. But it's the most expensive in the history of the cinema (a reported $300M), it's going to be one of the biggest revenue earners in the history of films (already the fastest ever to make $1B), it's technologically groundbreaking, and we've waited 12 years (since \"Titantic\") for writer and director James Cameron to return to our cinemas. All of which makes it something really special. I saw it in both 3D and IMAX on the largest screen in Britain (BFI in central London) and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is not \"Lawrence Of Arabia\" but it is immensely entertaining and its glorious imagery lives in the mind long after viewing.<br/><br/>Set about a century or so from now entirely on a planet unoriginally called Pandora which uniquely houses a special energy source inanely named Unobtainium, much of the interaction between the humans - disabled ex-marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and scientist Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) - and the 10 foot tall, blood-skinned, flat-nosed locals the Na'vi - most notably Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) - comes through the adoption by the humans of avatars which only operate when they are in induced sleep.<br/><br/>There was scope here to explore what it means to be human and what treatment we should accord not just 'tribal' people but artificial creations, but subtlety is not Cameron's forte. Instead we have largely stereotypical characters - most especially in the economically-driven company man and the psychotic warrior colonel - with heavy dialogue and no plot surprises. The messages are very New Age spiritual, with lots of talk of energy and deity, and eco-friendly in a form that is almost Gaia-like, while the military treatment of the Na'vi makes this a sci-fi version of \"Dances With Wolves\" and the talk of fighting \"terror with terror\" and use of \"shock and awe\" clearly relates to recent American action in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br/><br/>But, heh, visually this is a stunning work with a fantastical world of flora and fauna and lots of high-tech gadgetry wonderfully created in three dimensions that should be seen on the biggest screen you can visit. There is enough action and excitement to fill the more than two and a half hours and make this a movie to remember and - like \"Titantic\" - worth revisiting.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">okay, so the first part was terrible, really awful. it reminded me at 'Dances with Wolves', and though I really love that movie and I'm a big fan of Kevin Costner, I just couldn't believe what James Cameron had done: Cameron took 'Dances with Wolves' and mutilated it into 'Avatar', a film of which he says he's very proud, that it's groundbreaking and that it's opening the portal for future generations, making 3D-movies. ri-i-i-ight... let's start with the special effects: they are known as ow so huge, but I didn't saw a zip. another thing: I'm half blind, my left eye is dead, so I really didn't have anything with that three dimensions effect. ow, so the director wasn't thinking on pleasuring people with sight disabilities? I would say he didn't. but let's forget that fact, and concentrate on the story: it's bullBEEP, it's nothing, I couldn't care less about what was happening, the storyline was unsatisfying and the pace was way too slow to keep me interested a single bit.<br/><br/>but the second part of the movie was unbelievable good. it swept me away, I was sitting there with my mouth open. not the special effects were admirable, even though some may say they were, but the story was really interesting, I wanted to know how it all ended. one could say the second part saved the movie for me, now I totally understand why it's such a wave. let's embrace this movie and give it all the awards it could get.<br/><br/>still, I'm wondering what Kevin Costner is thinking about Avatar, because it's only his 'Dances with Wolves' in a science fiction coat. nevertheless, both were great movies, but I've already seen 'Dances with Wolves' seven times, and I'm hoping I will never ever ever have to watch 'Avatar' again.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Nobody directs like James Cameron. Ten years in the works, and every minute was worth it. It is the Star Wars of the 21st century. Though the plot is derivative and bears some pretty close resemblance to Dances with Wolves and a little bit of The Last Samurai, it does not ruin a mind-blowing experience. Avatar has a great future ahead of it and, possibly another Oscar for the mighty James Cameron. <br/><br/>Jake Sully, is an ex-marine, bound to a wheel chair. He seeks to make a fresh start on the moon Pandora where his brother worked. The moon has a military run mining colony. The business has brought humans into contact with the local natives, tall blue dudes, called Na'vi. The Na'vi inhabit a part of the moon under which lies a large deposit of valuable minerals, and the humans are trying to get them to relocate. Colonel Quarich who runs the operation, ask Sully to go under cover as a Na'vi, to learn the secrets, to give the humans an advantage. If successful, Sully will get his legs back. The magic of future science and 3-D effects give Sully a handsome genetically engineered Avatar body, and he embarks on his mission. Once on the inside however, his loyalties to the humans start to turn when his heart gets lost to the Na'vi princess Neytiri. Is he willing to fight on the blue side now?<br/><br/>The landscape of Pandora is the most creative and inventive of the decade. There are creatures that you might find in your wildest dreams or your worst nightmares. There is flora and fauna that shine with the bioluminescence of a thousand deep sea critters, and also trees which dwarf the Empire State Building.<br/><br/>I guess the only noticeable problem with Avatar, is a lack of original story. What you see on the screen will blow you away, but all the tough critics, may come down a bit on the fact that despite being the latest in film technology, Cameron uses a very old archetypal formula, perhaps just a bit too schematic. There are a few badly scripted segments of dialogue, but nothing that makes you wanna blow raspberries at the screen.<br/><br/>What is most important is the fact that Cameron's story gets the viewer involved and offers a handful of memorable and likable characters to root for, and some to root against. This is the post- modern era, and originality is rare, but if there is any technical progress to be made in the world of movies and entertainment, there is one name that dwarfs all JAMES CAMERON, and after ten years hiding from the Hollywood mainstream, he is back.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">My Rating : 9/10<br/><br/>Avatar is outstanding. I don't think I had seen a more visually beautiful film up until Avatar. This was back in 2009 and I had watched it in 3D and I was completely blown away by the visuals. This probably is the best 3D movie I've ever seen. Check it out. I simply don't understand how some people have given it a low rating. This is top notch movie-watching experience.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In Avatar, a bunch of marines in a big spacecraft (with a rotating segment - Aliens) are woken from hyper-sleep (Alien) and drop shipped to a new planet (Aliens) in a vehicle with a snub-nosed cockpit (Aliens). The planet is inhabited by ten-foot tall blue aliens (Battlefield Earth) who worship a big tree (Pochahontas) One of the marines is able to mix in with the natives (Ferngully) and comes to love them. The native culture glows as does their forest with a conveniently visible energy religion (Tron). Something meaningful is conveyed with the phrase \"I SEE you!\" (Joy Luck Club). In the end there is a war featuring man-shaped robot-exoskeletons (Mars Attacks, Transformers, Star Wars, Aliens, District 9, MIB, Robocop, Terminator). And a Latina Marine sacrifices herself (Aliens). <br/><br/>What surprising about Avatar is how shamelessly derivative it is, while 20-year olds ignorant of older movies tell you it's the most original, most important thing since glow-in-the-dark bread. I hope to never see another movie with the exoskeleton idea again. Because 20 years later, films have thoroughly exhausted the concept. There is some good stuff in Avatar. Chief among it, is a subversive viewer-identity concept that has you rooting against your own species/planet. It's perfectly appropriate that Cameron sees through the Iraq war and the moral bankruptcy of both corporations and the Right; but he dares to say five thousand marines with tunnel-vision being led by a hot-head who's never created anything, are NOT the pride of the nation. And he's right. It's very strange to be delighted when the humans finally get decimated. A strange moment to witness... and it's brought to you by the growing revulsion people feel for a misused army and for evil corporations in general, and the sickening cross-pollination of the two.<br/><br/>Two gigantic moral quandaries are never even addressed: Isn't it unethical to make living things that have no life until a person avatars them? And the marine is still selling out the natives waaaaaay after he's come to admire them ??? The movie is not really science fiction... it is fantasy, which is not really my cup of Q'thar. If you've seen one Native American documentary and two National Geographic specials, you've seen these ideas before. (Why do I keep buying the 3-D glasses? In every 3-D movie, the effect is interesting for exactly ten minutes.)</div>,\n",

So why did I not take a shining to this film that had all those elements and more? Why did I not warm up to it? What was it that was missing from this piece?<br/><br/>It's kind of the same reason I didn't go see \"ID4\", and why I thought that concept of a film was pretty bad in the first place. It had no soul.<br/><br/>So it is with Bruce Cameron's \"Avatar\", a play on the realm of computer games and online interaction, which tells the tale of a man who is likewise relegated to forever living vicariously through his blue skinned alternate persona. A comment on today's youth if I ever saw and heard one before in my life.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" hits all the right dramatic cues. It hits all the right emotional chords for drama, plot, character, story, and even has dazzling visuals to accompany the tale of a world fraught with noble savages warring with a corporate army.<br/><br/>I found myself laughing, loving, and even shedding tear or two as I watched this film in a packed movie theatre. And with all of the explosive action, with all of the romance and traditional underdog fighting hightech warrior themes going on, what was it that this film lacked?<br/><br/>For all of the pro-native and pro-life messages going on here, I just found the thing to be fairly plain and unintelligent. The message of the film is sent via a telegram. It's written in big letters and nearly shoved down the throat of the audience with a huge silver spoon. Couple that with the \"muster your inner soul\" thing, and I had a hard time connecting with this film on a basic level.<br/><br/>Oh sure, I got all the emotional stuff, and agreed with the moments of drama, but it simply was a film made for a five year old teenager. In short, it was unintelligent. <br/><br/>When I think of classic sci-fi that I watched ages ago, I think of films that were made for adults even though they were veiled in high gloss that attracted younger viewers. That, and they had a set of precepts of what was right, and what was wrong. It wasn't a clinical analysis and twisting of basic and fundamental American values, and breakage thereof.<br/><br/>But \"Avatar\" is made for the young \"international\" youth audience. It's designed to be a universal message attempting to appeal to everyone and everything. It's like a politician who promises a chicken in every pot, who kisses babies, shakes hands and the like, but winds up being powerless because he's promised too much to everyone, and has lost his own sense of worth. <br/><br/>That sounds very existential, but it's essentially the problem with \"Avatar\". And it's essentially part of the reason it is not thriving like the other established sci-fi franchises out on the market. \"Avatar's\" message is that your primal instinct to mate should outweigh your other responsibilities, and that those other values that are wrapped in a colored cloth are mere jingoism and are merely clouding your judgment. The nail in the message's coffin is the corporate army is just that, a business venture run for mass murder, and for the sake of controlling and educating the natives. <br/><br/>It's a trite message for a film that demonstrates equal regard for its target audience. And as for the 3D adding to the film? I saw the same technology demonstrated at Disneyland 25 years before with Captain EO. I can't say much has improved.<br/><br/>Watch at your own risk.</div>,\n",

Stephen Lang makes a great villain, Worthington and Uhura there carry off their roles well, Wes Studi and Ripley are welcome additions. I enjoyed the walker bots, the pterodactyl mounts, the hammer-headed rhinos and dayglo sentient plants. All fairly well drawn and realized by Cameron.<br/><br/>The baddies lose, the good guy turns and helps out the big bloo katpeople win and keep their planet.

But it came as a shock to me when I noticed that I'd seen before; only it was called 'The Last Samurai,' 'On Deadly Ground,' 'Pocahontas,' and several other things. The acting was good, not amazing. The action wasn't bad, but not good. The effects were great, but there were better ones a few years before. There were no elements of originality. Thus, it was a big bore. Cameron's Titanic and Terminator were a billion times better than this. However, on the upside, I thought that the 3 Oscars it won were relevant. But the 8.3 and grossing is much too exaggerated.

Borrows heavily from the old cartoon FERNGULLY and various Miyazaki cartoons. Plus Cameron filches from his own ALIENS and just about every Western ever made. Worse, it sends the wrong message to its primary audience, which consists of the very young and the impressionable of all ages. Basic plot: A crew of scientists and Marines is digging for a rare element (archly called \"unobtanium\") on an alien planet. The indigenous population consists of \"large blue monkeys,\" which stand in for the American Indian here. These blue aborigines stand in the way of the mining. Guess where this is going. In case we don't immediately get the connection with the American Indian, Casmeron has the so-called blue monkeys living in harmony with and endlessly preaching about all living things, both fauna and flora. They ride their semi-horses bareback and fly on the backs of semi-dragons and communicate directly with the earth. They laugh and love and sing and dance -- they even engage in a MATRIX-style rave near the end. I almost expected Larry Fishburne to show up. This whole business gets embarrassing and tired very quickly, and yet it drags on and on. Worse yet, a Marine assigned to infiltrate the natives (don't ask how) himself goes native, and betrays his own people. Cameron makes this a good thing. Military bad, natives good. Ugh. It all comes to a head with an improbable, pretty graphic battle that should not have been in a kiddie flick. This movie is almost three hours long! It easily surpasses the dreadful A.I. for false endings. And like SPIDERMAN, if you were to remove most of the CGI crap and stay focused on the live action, you'd probably have a better movie for it. At least you'd have some sort of a movie, although I also must confess I was less than impressed by the film's leading man, the very bland Sam Worthington, who also narrates the damned thing. And again, no matter what one might do to this film, cut it or recast it, its message is about as left-leaning and tree-hugging as you can get. It is pure self-indulgence on Cameron's part, much like THE ABYSS, one of those it's-like-watching-a-train-wreck epics. God, I so wanted all those \"blue monkeys\" wiped off the face of the planet within the first five minutes of their appearance, I knew I had been duped that quickly. I am giving AVATAR a 4 instead of a 1 or 2 because of its box office take. Movie-making is a business, after all, and I used to be a professional film critic. You have to figure that there's an awful lot of impressionable people out there who were eager to be parted from their money. They all voted for Obama, too.</div>,\n",

What imagination he's got and the possibility to bring the images born by his vision to big screen in the incredible artistic manner. 12 years in makings, 300 or 400 millions spent, perhaps thousands of the first class specialists in their fields creating the breathtaking world of the planet Pandora and her inhabitants, her flora and fauna. 163 minutes long, AVATAR is an event in movie-making. It's got many important messages, too, regarding the wars, nature and connection of all living creatures, but first of all it is breakthrough in creating visuals in the modern film. I think many people all over the world will accept and admire it. Even if they won't love the story which is anything but new and relies heavily on the ideas that have been presented before in the films like Matrix, New World, Dances with the Wolves, Last Samurai, Star Wars, and many more and they find the characters not very deep and their dialogs often clichéd, there is still a lot to admire in the new film by James Cameron, the visionary who has given us Aliens, Terminator and T2, True Lies, and yes, Titanic. When you go to see Avatar and I think you should, please make it 3D watching - you will be pulled inside the film to the magic world created by James Cameron during 12 years since his last feature film.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">REEDITED AFTER A SECOND WATCH:<br/><br/>Visually stunning. Full stop. No one in their right mind would disprove this statement. And I must say that it actually keeps you in your seat in awe for about 80 minutes. The problem is finding something to do with the remaining 80 minutes...<br/><br/>After a second watch (due to my wife not seeing the movie yet) I felt the necessity to re-edit my review. Basically I felt I exaggerated some of my claims, albeit I stay with the general grade. Nonetheless a lot remains true, as i.e. how extremely shocking it is that after all the love devoted to the graphics and hitec (absurdly used for a tree-hugging 'technology sucks' extravaganza) he was unable to give even 10% of the same amount of care to the script.<br/><br/>As far as acting is concerned it wasn't as bad as initially thought, albeit James Cameron's tie with actors is progressively getting worse with each movie - basically he has become too focused on the technical side and lets too much subpar acting enter his movie with a drive for perfection. \"Avatar\" is tragically miss-directed and it seems Cameron spent not enough time with actors as he was too immersed in the 3D. The acting in general was passable, albeit Sam Worthington was well below par, while his voice-over vlogging was cringeworthy and initited a couple of unwanted laughs of ridicule. Of all the characters only Stephen Land as Colonel Miles Quaritch made a good impression, while the less said about the rest the better. However there is no character in the whole movie, who isn't basically nothing more than an archetype. It is as though Cameron decided to totally ignore character-building so he could focus on the gimmicks and therefore decided to copy-paste multiple paper-thin stereotypical characters that populate the planet of Pandora. Even the two main characters of crippled ex-marine Ben (Sam Worthington) and his Na'vi female companion Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) have no emotion in them. <br/><br/>The above also says a lot about the special effects, as the facial expression of the Na'vi lack a lot of emotion. Surprising given graphically inferior pictures like \"Up\" manage to touch the heart. On a graphical level the movie may be breathtaking, but it is not flawless. The Na'vi characters look quite ridiculous with the dumb-looking ears sticking out especially awfully. Also the movement of Na'vi tries to be realistic, but plainly isn't and I have seen character animations done much better in films with 1/10 the budget. It also says a lot that the Mechrobot in \"District 9\" looks way better than in \"Avatar\". The most influential imprint of the movie is the wildlife, forests and general settings, albeit a couple of animals in the movie are rather pathetically done (i.e. the Pandora lemurre).<br/><br/>That brings us to the script itself, which is immensely flawed. Instead of intelligent conversations and complex storyline we are served a Pocahontas remake in space populated with one-liners and some very lax plotting. Plot holes galore most of them can be forgiven or even missed altogether. It is a shame, because some of the ideas in the movie are quite intriguing, even if wasted by the terribly uninspiring storytelling. The biggest flaw to the storytelling comes with the final fight sequence, which is plain moronic from a tactical point of view and punctuates the fact that the scriptwriter/director was really subpar/underdeveloped/weak. James Cameron really should have given the script to someone for consultations. Even without a military background it is quite apparent to any one with a brain that you do not coordinate a full frontal attack on superior forces, if all you are armed with are arrows. How the hell did an ex-marine tactics come down to attacking machine-wielding Mechrobots with indians on horses? And they are surprised that this ended in a massacre? Guerilla tactics ring a bell, Cameron?<br/><br/>But in the end this is eye-candy and for that alone it deserves accolades. But this really brings us to answer the question: What is art in film? This film is a piece of graphic art on so many levels and as such should be screened in art galleries all around the world. But film is not solely about full-frontal sensory-rape.<br/><br/>I can see people loving to immerse into this beautiful world and delving into escapism. It is a symptom of the era in which we live in, where what surrounds us does not bring enough joy or hope. Hence we fall into fantasy worlds be it through games (like World of Warcraft), books or movies. On this level I would be capable of giving Avatar a much higher score. But then I remember what Peter Jackson did with \"Lord of the Rings\" and how well crafted the movie was on every level and I know it would not be just to place this terribly subpar but beautiful movie anywhere close to Jackson's convincing portrayal of Middleearth. There were reasons why Ian McKellen was taken into account by the Academy for his role in The Fellowship... \"Avatar\" will be forever remembered solely for its technological achievement, as there is nothing else of consequence going for this movie...<br/><br/>After re-watching \"Up\" (a far superior movie on every level) it just came to me that in the future Pixar and others will be making movies in the same technology. And their stories and direction will blow Cameron out of the water. This movie may be a hall-mark but with each passing year it will become even more out-dated and the faults of the script will stick out like a dozen sore thumbs...<br/><br/>To sum it up: A breakthrough - yes. A masterpiece - far from it. Take away the awesome bling and you have a Razzie award winner.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">When one looks back on what was the greatest movie of the first decade of the new century, there was only one that changed it all...Avatar. Most of the films that Hollywood made that made tons of money were remakes, sequels, and spin-offs to original movies or based on existing property. Avatar was the only original movie worth paying money to see. Great CGI, good use of 3-D, a good plot, and memorable characters makes this a classic for the ages. Too bad it got shutout at the Oscars by another war movie that many didn't see. I hope they make a good sequel that lives up to the original and end it with a third and final film if Avatar 2 does well in 2014.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This film is good only for the special effects and for the design of the creatures, the rest is not that great and the plot is even worse because it is banal and without particular feeling.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is indeed the most visually spectacular and colorful cinematic experience created to date - it's visual spectacle emboldens a fairly simple, pedestrian, and maybe even somewhat clichéd storyline. I'm sure there's umpteen posts that re-iterate the story as sort of a detraction or weakness in the movie, but it still works satisfactorily. Probably the only part of the movie that was hit or miss for me was the score and musical choices. I'm a traditionalist with music and score - enjoying orchestras and symphonies over song and beats. Anyway the visual achievement is so stunning it probably makes it a Best Picture Winner and deservedly so - the story only need be satisfactory and not impede.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">A paraplegic marine is sent to a program that would give him the ability to walk, as well as be over ten feet tall with blue skin. He becomes a Na'vi, these native like creatures that live on Pandora, a moon that scientists and marines want to invade to grab some minerals that are worth lots and lots of money. <br/><br/>I must say that before I saw Avatar, in IMAX 3-D no less, I made an effort to avoid every trailer, every TV spots and anything regarding the plot. It was difficult because everything on the internet and in the media was AVATAR for the months leading up to it. But I managed to pull it off, knowing that knowing nothing about it would probably heighten my experience. It did. Was I expecting to be blown away? I was, but did Cameron pull it off? For the most part. The film, from a visual and technical stand point is marvelous. Is it the next step in film-making? It looks like it, but it feels more like a first step and not the giant leap people have been waiting for.<br/><br/>Avatar stars the next big star, Sam Worthington. His twin brother has died and the government needs him to operate this avatar that is worth millions. Since he is genetically identical, they figured it would be fine. Sigourney Weaver is the person spearheading the operation, she is always butting heads with Stephen Land, the Colonel and Giovanni Ribisi, the head honcho of everything. She wants to learn and comes to love the natives, they want to blow them all up. There is our conflict ladies and gentlemen. Where is Worthington in all this? He becomes emotionally attached to one of the Na'vi creatures and fights on their side. I don't blame him because for the first time ever, I was sexually attracted to a creature created from motion capture, played by Trekkie Zoe Saldana. <br/><br/>So Avatar is the big game changer, or so they say. Let me say that I wanted this film to be my Star Wars. I wasn't alive when that film came out, so I've never really had that AWE moment. Lord of the Ring came close and Avatar has come even closer. But it never really reached it. Cameron and his team have created a world with so much detail that you'll probably have to see the film twice just to break the surface. He paints the film in beautiful colours, even at night. Everything illuminates beautifully, and it was a smart move. Using 3-D technology, Cameron knew he had to brighten the picture, since everyone would have these dark classes on their eyes. His camera, which he created, gave him an edge on using the technology and he uses it well. It's not gimmicky like G-Force or lame like Harry Potter. <br/><br/>The film has many memorable sequences. I had heard the final battle is off the wall crazy and while it was well done and looked great, I didn't feel like it was 'off the wall crazy'. Seeing Worthington try and tame a creature of flight was one of the more memorable moments. Every moment on Pandora is beautiful and you literally have no idea what to expect. Cameron has created something new here and I commend him for that. In a year full of sequels and load obnoxious films that feel stale, Cameron has created a world that is new, fresh and bright. The story is something we've seen before, but we connect well enough with the characters that we care about the end battle. Did I care in Transformers? Hell no.<br/><br/>Cameron has yet to disappoint me, he continuously pushes the edge of technology and film in general. He takes risks and he manages to pull it off every time, despite the nay sayers. There have been millions of them, they doubted Titanic and when he proved them wrong, they doubted him again with Avatar. In my opinion, he's proved them wrong again, but I can see a lot of people not liking the film as much, The reason? A lot of people are having gripes with the story. It's not bad, it's just been done. I don't care if it's been done, as long as it's done well. Avatar does it well. People tell me that they don't expect the film to blow them away, it might not. I totally expect people to be 50/50 on this film. <br/><br/>In the end, Avatar is a film you need to see. I saw it in 3-D and in IMAX, I went in knowing nothing about it. I had no idea that they all controlled the Na'vi creatures, I had no idea about why they were there or even that he had a twin. Was the film worth it? It sure was, the experience is one to marvel in. This film was a film made for IMAX, and in the words of Cameron himself, made for 3-D. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as I did if it were a regular screen. Everyone's talking about it, everyone's seeing it, so be a part of the phenomenon.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar, the newest James Cameron epic.Avatar is officially the highest grossing film of all time(not counting the inflation of older films of course), beating Cameron's previous film \"Titanic\" which held the record for a good 12 years.Also keep in mind, the film was released in 3D and therefore the ticket prices for the 3D are higher than the price of an average ticket.Now visually, this film is amazing.The special effects are great and the film is nice to look at.The acting is good as well.The story on the other hand, has been done before.The film is about a young paraplegic marine named Jake Sully who takes part in a program where he is placed in the body of an alien and meant to stay in the alien tribe to learn how they live.At first, the others don't like him all that much, but they grow to like him and he grows to like them.However, the army is planning an attack on them.So now, Jake and the other aliens must fend them off.Avatar is a pretty good film, it's just not as breathtaking as everybody says it is.Worth a watch though I personally found it overrated.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">One thing about Avatar is unconditionally true, it's a technical marvel. My mind staggers at the thought of how much creativity and hard work went into the creation of Pandora. From the plants, to the animals, to the faces of the humanoid characters, Avatar is stellar. And the way it's all integrated together with the human characters makes it even more impressive.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, it's good enough to not detract from the visuals. The story is a tried-and-true favorite. Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, and the other cast members are fine, whether they're in Navi bodies or their own. <br/><br/>My main complaint with the movie was how cartoonishly evil the main villain was. It's a bit hard for me to swallow such a 2-D antagonist, these days. Otherwise, this is a solid adventure movie with some of the prettiest computer animation that you'll ever see.</div>,\n",

They can rip your head of, hatch out inside you, devour humanity alive, spray the ground with our blood, destroy our planet, serenade us on mountain-tops and even get drunk and phone-home - but they never take a dump. Not ever. America's diffidence to toiletary frankness is a comedy in itself. Hollywood's directors should watch more 'Carry On-' movies.<br/><br/>Here we have director King Cameron once more. And if 'Avatar' leaves you with deja-vu moments, that's because it resembles just about every other sci-fi movie there's ever been. And Cameron should know. His 'Aliens' was such a blatant rip-off of the 1950's bug-fest 'Them' as to justify the accusation of plagiarism. Originality is definitely not his strong suit.<br/><br/>There's trouble on another planet. Some ruthless corporation is mining its assets and the locals are getting a raw deal. An agent is sent to infiltrate them in disguise. If you've seen 'Total Recall'; you already know the plot.<br/><br/>Cue the special effects. There's big, CGI flying creatures that smack of 'Dumbo', but lack his grace. There's a psychotic military-type intent on blowing the other-worldly ones to hell, just like (Cameron's) 'Abyss'. There are propeller-driven hovering/flying machines straight from (Cameron's) 'Terminator 2'. There's big walking robots with men inside straight from ('Cameron's) 'Aliens'. Crikey - even Ripley - er..I mean Sigourney Weaver pops up! There's mass battles in the woodland like the Empire versus the Ewoks. And there's more than a hint of 'The Emerald Forest' in which corporate greed has precedent over environmental degradation.<br/><br/>But where's STORY? In other words: something happening to somebody I care about. Sadly; it's nowhere. Even the humans are as two-dimensional as the CGI creatures. This might have been filmed in 3-D, but the plot was as 2-D as ever.<br/><br/>A lot of thought went into special-effects. And 'if you like that, your're gonna love this' (that's from 'Aliens'). But no thought whatsoever went into zoological or botanical rationale. And Darwin didn't get a look-in. Where was the the bio-diversity? I think I spotted 6 different species in the whole forest.<br/><br/>The trouble with cinema is that in order to maximise bums on seats, movies need to appeal to kids as well as adults. The result is that they are often excessively violent for children, but too crass for adults. They're over-simplistic in their evaluation of life.<br/><br/>I didn't watch this in much-vaunted 3-D, so maybe I missed something (like a headache). But what I saw was a very elaborate montage of just about every other sci-fi movie there's ever been and then some. And the earlier ones were better because they were original, even if their effects were not so grandiose. And they weren't always dumbed-down to satisfy juvenile appetites. <br/><br/>If Cameron really wanted to be earth-shattering, all he had to do was break the ultimate Hollywood taboo and show us an alien taking a dump. I'd have applauded that even in black &amp; white!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Here is a movie on which it seems everyone has a strong opinion. It is the highest grossing movie in history, taking in almost $3 billion around the world, and it revolutionized the industry (for better or worse) by showing that 3D could be a profitable new element in cinema. James Cameron is one of my favorite all-time directors and is no stranger to creating ground-breaking special effects (e.g. TERMINATOR 2). He may not be the strongest writer, but he knows how to bring a story to life better than most. AVATAR is set in a distant future where a corporation has discovered a large deposit of the valuable element \"unobtainium\" on a moon called Pandora. The environment is hostile, the wildlife vicious, and the atmosphere poisonous. As if that wasn't enough, the mining is inhibited by Pandora's indigenous, a species called the Na'vi. In an attempt to interact with the Na'vi, the Avatar program was created in which a person is jacked into a specially-grown human/Na'vi hybrid. Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is recruited into the program to fill the Avatar left by his dead brother and, upon finding himself lost in the Pandora wilderness, is cautiously accepted into a Na'vi tribe where he learns their life and customs. As the humans grow closer to moving the Na'vi out of the way by force, Jake is torn between his obligation to the mission and his love for the beautiful Neytiri and her people.<br/><br/>Cameron is a fantastic visionary. He literally brings the alien world of Pandora to life, meticulously creating an entirely new ecosystem and culture for this film. I'll admit, I am a huge fan of Cameron's but the trailers for this film did nothing to interest me. If my friend hadn't been interested in seeing the film, I probably would've missed out. Instead, I saw the film in 3D IMAX and my mind was blown at the epic effects Cameron brought to the screen. Once I was exposed to Pandora, my mind never once dropped out of the film and remembered I was watching an entire CG world. It was beautifully seamless. Still, I was not one of those viewers who saw the film and became clinically depressed when it was over. It was good, but it wasn't that good. As you've probably read in countless other reviews and comments on the film, it's far from original. It's the same story you've seen before in DANCES WITH WOLVES or THE LAST SAMURAI, but it's Cameron's spin on the tale and he was sure to include his \"green\" message about the importance of the environment and the evils of technology. Absolutely entertaining, but nothing that'll leave you breathless.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington is Jake Sully, and I suppose he did a decent enough job. He's not an amazing actor (in my opinion, but I've only seen him in two films and neither required a whole lot from him) but it's not hard to mess up the role of a disillusioned Marine grunt. He's only required to act somber with the occasional impassioned moment when he's rallying the Na'vi to join him in battle or falling for Neytiri. Zoe Saldana, on the other hand, is freakin' great. She does an amazing job here and it's even more impressive when you consider that her character was entirely CGI and created with motion capture. The same kudos can be extended to CCH Pounder, Laz Alonso, etc for creating powerful emotion through what essentially boils down to million dollar cartoons. Stephen Lang is my favorite performance in the movie as the hard-boiled Colonel Quatrich, head of security for the humans on Pandora. He's a stone-cold soldier and isn't afraid to storm into the heat of battle. Sigourney Weaver, Giovanni Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez, and Joel Moore round out a strong supporting cast.<br/><br/>The writing is weak (unobtainium?) but the visuals are beautiful and the cast turn in some good performances. It's not the best of 2009 but I believe it still shows Cameron hasn't lost his touch. I guess we'll have to wait and see how the sequels turn out.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">An ex-Marine finds himself thrust into hostilities on an alien planet filled with exotic life forms. As an Avatar, a human mind in an alien body, he finds himself torn between two worlds, in a desperate fight for his own survival and that of the indigenous people.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of James Cameron. The best film ever created is TITANIC, in my opinion. I'm not afraid to admit it. It should be no surprise that I absolutely loved AVATAR after walking out of the screening room. Now, did I walk in with a certain bias toward the film? Probably, yes, I would say. However, to be fair, the film surpassed the hype which made it out to be a revolutionary film that will change the course of film making of all mankind. And I will say this now: This revolutionary film will change the course of film making of all mankind.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so revolutionary is that it sets a standard for 3D movies, and a high one at that. It not only puts the 3D to good use, in a way it contributes to the overall story than having things pop out every five seconds, but it is also successful at integrating motion capture with live performances in a way where it blows every previous films faulty attempts away. The technology is that good. Trust me. Technically, the film should be able to win every award dealing with it because, let's be honest, Cameron knows how to tell a broad story, especially in this size and scope.<br/><br/>But what about the story? I've been rambling about how good the technology and the effects are, considering it has a budget of around $275 million. The story is sometimes predictable and clichéd. If anything, people usually commend Cameron's ability to tell a story on screen but don't put his screen writing skills as high as a place as that and I see why people would say that. There are many films this movie borrowed from, but you know what? I don't care. Every film is, in some degree, predictable, and I believe this and the earnestness to tell and end the story in a way that has been done before is what adds to the wondrous quality of the film.<br/><br/>When I saw Sam Worthington in TERMINATOR: SALVATION, which came out earlier this year, I didn't appreciate his performance like many people did. However, in this film, I think he did a great job as the thick-minded character. Sigourney Weaver is in a role that is actually perfect for her but I'd assume Cameron wrote the part specifically for her, but I think she's great she's in a film that is good for her because her last few roles in the past few years have been very \"eh.\" Zoe Saldana, I must say, did an excellent job as Worthington's love interest. She has this magnificent talent where you believe and feel every word she speaks.<br/><br/>Stephen Lang plays a fantastic villain role, albeit a predictable and one-dimensional one. It's a character we all love to hate. Another character like that is played by Giovanni Ribisi, playing the \"captain\" who will never understand all the bad decisions he makes. Other actors I'd like to mention in this excessive cast are Michelle Rodriguez, Joel Moore, and CCH Pounder. For a film that is over 2 hours and 30 minutes long, the film doesn't have a dull nor slow moment, probably because a story this big should have this long a running time in order to tell it. The soundtrack by James Horner is magical but by no means one of the best ever.<br/><br/>I found the film to be not only a huge spectacle but also a film with a story that is not so white and black and with characters you believe and root for. It also deals with some relevant, moral issues. It's entertaining, spellbinding, and a magical experience in 3D. Rarely have I ever found myself so entranced by a movie. AVATAR is the best movie of this year. See the movie in 3D not because it's better or cooler but because it's necessary. See it now. Run, don't walk, to your nearest theater. This is a movie you should see before you die.</div>,\n",

The problem is the Navi are sitting on top of it and the US needs them to move so the US can mine it. Sully's job is to get the Navi to move. <br/><br/>I now know why Avatar didn't win Best Picture and Best Director. The Academy never saw the movie. They heard so much about it by word-of-mouth they felt like they had seen it. Then, Ms Bigelow and a S.W.A.T. Team captured the entire Academy in a room and wouldn't let them out until she had Best Picture and Best Director in a slam dunk for the Hurt Locker. Pretty sure it went something like that. <br/><br/>I didn't watch it in 3-D. But, this is a visual treat regardless of what dimension you watch it in. There are not worthy and adequate words to describe what you will see. You have never seen anything like the visuals in this movie. You will, as I did, rediscover the color Blue. Also, the CGI is absolutely spectacular. James Cameron, the Director, is truly a genius.<br/><br/>Yes, the first half is a visual feast for your eyes. In the second half, the real story starts and as you may suspect, a war breaks out. Unless I missed something in the beginning, I never once heard anyone talk about Negotiations between the US and the Navi. It's possible I missed that because the beginning went by so fast, I had the feeling someone assumed I knew about Pandora, the Navi, the Avatar Program, the hi-Tech equipment and the robotics. I didn't know what the word AVATAR meant. And, exactly where is Pandora? That word-of-mouth didn't reach me. <br/><br/>As soon as those 3-D TV sets become available and affordable I will get the 3-D glasses and give this another go.<br/><br/>Oh, this is a movie you may want to buy, but wait. Wait until some time goes by and another copy will come out telling you this one includes deleted scenes or scenes never seen before. That's the one you want to purchase. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes.

It may be the biggest and most spectacular blowout at the movies (And the 3D was good) but is this really the best film of this or any other decade?<br/><br/>The anthropologists did an OK job but I never really got under the skin of the culture and so what we get is just about a retelling of a Man Called Horse and the Native Indian experience.<br/><br/>All in all, fun, but for us it lacks that special feeling that makes the spectacle into a great experience...<br/><br/>RE-EDIT: I have just watched the BlueRay DVD and enjoyed this much more: I hadn't realised how much darker a film looks in 3D on the DVD the colors explode and the whole thin comes to life - really enjoyed it this time.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar has a lot of positive elements; perhaps not quite what you might expect from the biggest money-maker of all time, but a pretty good way to spend time on nevertheless. The special effects are extraordinary; augmented with a very concise conceptual utilization of 3-D. The action sequences are stunning and effective, while the landscape cinematography is an achievement in imagination and construction. No stone was unturned, in graphic designs of a forest world environment that comes alive and breathes vivid reality. Acting is at par, and all aspects of the production team did their job well.<br/><br/>Many movies \"influenced\" this film: Dances With Wolves and Pocahontas are the most obvious, certainly in terms of theme. All that's different is that the Europeans and Native Americans are respectively now greedy astronaut terra-formers and the indigenous life form on the planet they covet. The \"previously owned\" story line is unfortunately too brazen, and resembles soap-box preaching. Worn ideas culled from other movies and woefully over-wrought stereotypes rule the day, until the soap-box is crushed by the excess weight.<br/><br/>The idea of out of body experience, or even having your essence temporarily inhabit an artificial host body is nothing new, either. However, this movie does give the premise a nice spin, and certainly utilizes it well. Opposing forces want to use this technology for good, others for evil, and along the way one of the \"Dreamers\" learns the nature-worship ways of his wary neighbors. The native religion is the fulcrum of the story, but it's overused. Worst is the absurdly exaggerated vicious bigot military commander. Such a cliché is very backward for a movie like this.<br/><br/>Still, the movie has its merits. It's a visually artistic masterpiece, and everyone should see it. The familiar plot line doesn't hurt its entertainment value, and it earnestly approaches this story line with the best of intentions; most of which are realized.</div>,\n",

And we will ever. Truth be told Avavtar is not a movie but it is all of those things. It's an experience for nearly three hours be prepared to be truly transported to an alien world. The film is fascinating, thought provoking, emotional, action packed, tear jerking and well it just might be the best film I've ever seen. From a technical stand point the film is miraculous you've never experienced anything likt it. Cameron and his brilliant FX team have created an entire world. One that feels so real and so alive. The enviorment seems to react to everything. As do it's wonderous creatures. I don't think I'll spoil the film by explaining it but just let it be known that this is a very deep film with themes of humanity, connectiveness, enviorment, spirituality, life and death. And with all of this new technology it won't be long before nominations are going out to special effects creations for best performance. The whole film is a brilliant, enthralling experience. It may be the absolute best film I've ever seen. I haven't decided yet. But one thing is for sure it's like nothing I've experienced. it's the best film of the year and is a cinematic masterpiece of brilliance from James Cameron.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">How often do you get to see a turning point in cinematic history? Not in hindsight, but as it is actually happening? Not often. Those watching The Jazz Singer in 1927 (debut of audible dialogue) or Becky Sharp in 1935 (introduction of Technicolor) experienced it. I wasn't born for another eight years, but I have read and heard that when Star Wars first came out in 1977 people were feeling a similar way; that they were witnessing something never before seen that would change movies from that point on. Has it really been 32 years between motion pictures that have had this impact? Well, revolutionary movies wouldn't be revolutionary if they came along all the time.<br/><br/>James Cameron's long-awaited, much-touted 3D motion-capture technique is a step towards the future. What we see on screen during Avatar is nearly impossible to explain with words. But I'll try. Do you think 3D is just a gimmick? Think again. The depth and clarity afforded by the third dimension is invaluable; it immerses you into the action so well that you aren't sitting in a cinema for three hours, you enter a whole new world. Forget the blurry patches to the sides of the screen or the impossibility of seeing things that are moving too fast, as experienced in previous 3D flicks, with Avatar you see everything as if it were real.<br/><br/>The digital surroundings that Cameron has created (so he could shoot his actors with mo-cap in an environment that already existed) are awe-inspiring. Pandora is a beautiful forest and jungle-like land, whilst its non-Na'vi inhabitants are exotic and exhilarating in equal parts. The realism of this fantasy world is extraordinary; from the opening shot to the closing credits, Pandora and all its creatures do exist. In addition, and most importantly, the motion-capture technique used for the Na'vi is astounding. Cameron's groundbreaking technology enables the Na'vi to look, move and interact realistically; the smallest of nuances from the actors, including pupil movement, have been mimicked flawlessly onto their digital counterparts.<br/><br/>The aforementioned visual revelations are unsurprisingly marvellous during the action sequences – the climactic battle is undoubtedly the standout – however they lend themselves to the subtler scenes just as well. Cameron refuses to use his pioneering invention just for spectacle; he wants it to assist in capturing the minds and hearts of his audience. Take for example a couple of the scenes where the Na'vi fly on their local birdlife. To experience something so graceful and elegant, yet so thrilling and jaw-dropping, is where the real pleasure lies.<br/><br/>Most gratifying is not all the optical splendour on offer mind you, it is the powerful tale that it is in aid of. Cameron's account of love, war and nature is more affecting than you might expect. Avatar boasts a screenplay which at times will make you laugh, at times make you cheer and at times make your heart heavy. It never neglects the story and even infuses the action with a surprisingly high level of emotion. A pivotal scene midway through where the humans launch their first attack is genuinely gut-wrenching and shattering; evoking similar feelings you get when watching the atrocities committed in wars gone by. Cameron is greatly assisted by James Horner's booming score too; it's African-esquire sounds giving it an exotic and poignant feel that match the proceedings perfectly.<br/><br/>Hollywood's new kid on the block, Aussie actor Sam Worthington, delivers a star-making performance as the conflicted Jake that, along with his turns in Terminator Salvation and the upcoming Clash of the Titans, will surely see him catapult to the top of the A-list. The unrecognisable Zoe Saldana is breathtaking as Neytiri; Sigourney Weaver adds her usual class and elegance as the 'mother' of the Avatar program, Dr Augustine; Michelle Rodriguez gives a career-best performance as the cocky yet likable pilot Trudy Chacon; whilst Stephen Lang makes one heck of a badass.<br/><br/>James Cameron: thanks for giving this 24 y.o. his first chance to witness a turning point in cinematic history. It will not be forgotten.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</div>,\n",

Conquest. Destruction. Hell. Humility. Harmony. Renewal. Paradise.<br/><br/>Frank Zappa once said, \"Writing about music is like tap dancing about architecture.\" And there's no way to describe James Cameron's AVATAR without a lot of tap dancing.<br/><br/>If it weren't so serious, it would be satire. If it weren't so expensive it would be laughable. If it weren't so irresistibly watchable it would be golden trash.<br/><br/>Ah, which hubris to talk about first? The hubris of writer-director Cameron for foisting a story as old as the hills (or at least as old as Kevin Costner) on a demographic whom he is sure has never seen DANCES WITH WOLVES, 1990 (but might be familiar with the 2009 SOUTH PARK episode, Dances With Smurfs)?; the hubris of the human race in 2154, strip-mining Pandora, a verdant moon four light years from Earth, for a mineral called \"unobtanium\" (presumably named by a geologist who had no imagination on how to mine it, sell it or even think about its utility), and callously wiping out the indigenous Na'vi species to obtain it?; the hubris of Cameron utilizing his own all-new patented King-Of-The-World motion capture technology to turn real life actors (who perform the whole movie anyway in their sensored jumpsuits) into Na'vi cat-toons, Because He Can, at a cost which could wipe out hunger in at least two Third World countries?; or the hubris of we the audience by going along with Cameron's subtle demeaning of the Na'vi race by blindly taking it for granted they are so unsophisticated that they would accept an impostor into their midst whom they know is nothing more than a ventriloquial figure for a human? If the American Natives took blankets in exchange for land, I guess ALL indigenous peoples are that gullible...<br/><br/>Speaking of ventriloquial figures, Sam Worthington (as paraplegic jar head Sully) captures that wooden acting idiom that up until now was purveyed unchallenged by Christopher Reeve as SUPERMAN. Worthington's got a great career ahead of him as a plank.<br/><br/>Early minutes laden with exposition dialog are tiresome, as Cameron rationalizes the financially-unsound concept of military avatars - Na'vi creatures mixed with human DNA, mentally controlled by humans, mingling with the forest-dwelling Na'vi for the purposes of... something something metaphor something. Totally unnecessary, cos if the big bad military is going to forcefully strip-mine Pandora anyway, why bother snowjobbing the natives as avatars or negotiating a peaceful exodus? Sully neural-links with his ten-foot, blue-skinned cat-person through a MATRIX-like fusion of non-science, whereupon he experiences the euphoric use of his legs again. And a nice piece of tail. And if that isn't incentive enough to betray your own species, cue the sexy naked cat-chick, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) - a nice piece of tail - who, even though an alien, sports pert tennis ball ta-tas in a disturbingly anatomically-correct position on her chest, and who rides her bird-thing in a demonstrably human sexual position - and it's homo who? The tail only makes it hotter.<br/><br/>Though Sully is with the science team, the mantastically pumped-up Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) sequesters him as a double agent, to report tactical weaknesses in the Na'vi stronghold.<br/><br/>Sully has way too much fun being taught the Omaticaya tribe's ways by Neytiri, in a montage which screams upcoming unsafe sex scene.<br/><br/>By the time Sully plonks Neytiri on a bed of luminous lichen, his alliance with the natives is sealed. He fights on the side of the Na'vi when Quaritch comes a-calling with his giant helicopters, and what must be spectacular coffee, for him to be sipping it constantly while in heated missile strikes.<br/><br/>The military chop down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring, making the Na'vi wish they'd invented fire insurance.<br/><br/>In the movie's greatest irony, Quaritch keeps calling Pandora \"hell\" - when it is actually a paradise - as he BRINGS hell to Pandora with his gunships.<br/><br/>Thereby forcing the Na'vi to stoop to human methods of warfare; in essence, \"fighting terror with terror\" - because the filmmakers possess only limited \"human\" imaginations, and cannot conceive of battling military might other than by making two wrongs make a right.<br/><br/>So why bequeath this unoriginal, scientifically-contrived tale such high cucumber ratings? Because it is done with a surety of hand, a certainty of concept and a gleeful whoop of entertainment maximus. The script moves the story at such a clip we barely notice the dearth of plot and, to tell the truth, the science is adhered to more closely than most sci-fi actioners.<br/><br/>With the undoubted impact AVATAR has on first viewing, people have dusted off one of his old sobriquets and are calling Cameron \"king of the world\" once more. But which world? AVATAR's most impressive achievement is Pandora itself as an integral character; on its orbital position as a satellite of the large planet that dominates its sky; on its implied ecosystem that pulses from the screen in mind-numbing detail.<br/><br/>The Na'vi have an intimate greeting, \"I see you,\" meaning, of course, metaphorically. Not surprisingly, AVATAR opens and closes with shots of Sully's eyes opening - at the start, he wakes stupid, just a jar head on a cryogenic ride; in the final frames, he opens his eyes as a god; he is whole, wise in the ways of blue tooth, subsumed by the hive mind. He is Pandora's Jar.<br/><br/>Making the most wondrous thing about Pandora the fact that it could actually educate a jar head.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Twelve years after Titanic made him the self-proclaimed \"king of the world\", director James Cameron, with typical boldness, has declared his intention to not only attempt to reinvent the science fiction genre, but herald in a new era of technologically fuelled cinema. Having already rocked genre foundations with the Terminator series and currently armed with new technology poised to capture and render three dimensional computer generated imagery like never before, thus immersing the viewer into a fully realized cinematic environment, it appeared Cameron was prepared to make good on his ambitions. However, it is the film's staggering (and largely self-generated) hype, building a reputation of the film being \"the new Jazz Singer\", a film to radically change what the medium meant and how it worked, which, while obviously serving well to sell tickets (poignantly suggesting the ability of an otherwise less remarkable film to 'talk up' its own success) proves detrimental to the film. Avatar, while boasting undeniably flooring visuals, remains at heart a fun, solidly made yet slightly campy adventure tale, but nowhere near the singlehanded cinematic revolution it was declared to be.<br/><br/>It is ironic that the film's groundbreaking 3D proved its largest selling point, as nearly everything else about the film comes across as so strikingly 2D. The plot, stripped of its futuristic space trappings, proves a rather blatant re-tread of Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves, a narrative already and since nearly done to death, making the 'anti-capitalist, embracing individual and collective spirit' ideology promoted feel more of a requisite narrative checkmark rather than a heartfelt message (the intriguing thematic link of humans requiring 'avatars', or inhabiting fictional, constructed external bodies to 'realize their full potential' is equally left frustratingly unexplored). It also comes across as odd that a film twelve years in production would not have time for even a brief script revision, as most of Avatar's dialogue is unmistakably banal even for an action film, and any character development is reduced to throwaway lines of exposition, making it a struggle to take to any protagonist. Similarly, likely for the sense of further cultivating the feel of an 'important, epic immersion into another world', the film's ponderous running time is simply too long to feasibly stretch out such a shallow story, giving the narrative the feel of forcibly dragging, particularly when the plot being dragged out is so howlingly predictable as is.<br/><br/>But, the instant rebuttal arises, such concerns should ultimately be besides the point for a film whose interest is founded on its revolutionary visual spectacle. This is partially true, yet it is certainly worth arriving in the film prepared for the aforementioned complaints to mine the maximum enjoyment from the film. Nonetheless, for a film self-sold as the first step in a new age of cinema, the fact that such basic storytelling concerns can manage to distract from the sense of breathless immersion feels sub-standard and hardly groundbreaking if the allegedly unprecedented awe factor is marred by the same old complaints. The key, it would seem to an actual revolution in the medium of cinema, is a sense of roundedness – balancing the realism of the spectacle and sense of fun and excitement with sophistication, profundity and a uniform standard of quality. No matter how aesthetically groundbreaking, for a film to truly harbour a new epoch of the medium in such a cinema-conscious age, advancement on multiple levels, including narrative, would seem necessary.<br/><br/>That being said, Avatar's CGI and 3D visual effects remain unquestionably remarkable, all the moreso through the attention to minuscule details (tiny plant filaments drifting in the wind) as the massive, sprawling extraterrestrial battles. Yet again, for a film boasting so much, one cannot help but feel slightly let down (especially with benchmarks such as the Lord of the Rings films setting a comparable standard) that the envelope was not pushed slightly more, as, once the resonant thrill of being thrust into the alien world of Pandora dies down, details such as the alien Na'vi starting to appear cartoon-like when contrasted with live performers rather than being seamlessly integrated and the fact that all the admittably impressive alien creature designs still feel excessively anthropomorphized or all have six legs, making the fantastic 'otherness' of the world disappointingly recede. James Horner's distractingly formulaic musical score jarringly clanging away in the background hardly helps.<br/><br/>Similarly, all of Cameron's actors fall prey to the particular clunky style of performance which feels more forgivable in a film intended to be more outright fun than aiming for a 'serious epic' feel. Sam Worthington brings an affable earthiness and cocky humour to his paraplegic marine turned Na'vi saviour, but ultimately lacks the charisma to properly propel a film of such scope. Zoe Saldana tries her hardest, but ultimately is incapable of doing too much with a tiresomely clichéd 'native love interest' role. Sigourney Weaver has fun chewing the scenery at first and finally infusing the film with some honest emotion as a prickly scientist studying the Na'vi, but the normally reliable Stephen Lang and Giovanni Ribisi both wallow in campiness as pantomimes of villainy (vicious military man and petulant businessman respectively). Michelle Rodriguez delivers the most consistently satisfying performance as a cheeky military pilot, but her role is disappointingly clipped each time it generates the prospects of getting truly interesting.<br/><br/>In the end, as aesthetically eye-popping as Avatar is, the healthiest viewing attitude is to treat it as an unassuming adventure romp rather than as the 'important cinematic epic' Cameron would have it be regarded as. Perhaps this is ultimately fitting, as, in terms of the history of the medium, film was initially created and mass marketed as a form of entertainment, and on this front Cameron's film is fully and enthusiastically prepared to deliver. An upheaval to the medium of cinema? No. A very fun and largely quality (if thoroughly flawed) slice of mainstream adventure worth seeing? Definitely.<br/><br/>-8/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Avatar\" tells the story of a soldier who replaces his dead brother in an avatar program built to examine and influence a foreign species on a foreign planet. As he learns more and more about their life and culture, he begins to question the motives of his bosses and switches sides.<br/><br/>You can only honor all the visual effort and work that wys put into this film. I didn't watch it on a big screen but I can imagine that it is an overwhelming experience, visually. Unfortunately, I have to say that the plot is not equally convincing. What you get is more or less a story told several times before packed in a mediocre action movie. Some of the cultural aspects reach a bit beyond that but all in all this could well be your average action title wasn't it for the immense budget and effects.<br/><br/>All in all it is still worth a watch because it was a milestone in filmmaking and develops its magic from time to time but it is not as big a movie as you would expect it from such a production.</div>,\n",

Jake offers to earn their trust as an Avatar so the military can get closer to what they need. When Jake meets Neytiri and learn their ways of survival, he soon wants to help them and stop the humans from destroying Pandora. I highly recommend AVATAR!!!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The obvious and final debate about Avatar that pits the fanboys and 3D geeks against the plot-crazy and character-driven fans is whether or not the special effects and 3D setting is enough to entertain and drive home the film its entire running length of 160 minutes.<br/><br/>Well, since I belong to the latter group, I say that Avatar does not deliver the entire way as the final third loses steam tremendously. However, to start with the positive, there is no denying that writer/director James Cameron is one of the best, if not the absolute king of visual effects and epic storytelling. Cameron, who revolutionized movies with the Terminator films, Aliens and Titanic, continues to do what he does best with amazing attention to detail and astonishing creations of action sequences that completely surround and delight all audiences. There can be nothing bad said about the look and sound of the film, but there can be for the storytelling; heavy on storytelling and light on story.<br/><br/>People will say that I am missing the real reason for this movie and I am looking too hard and expecting too much, but really am I? Is it wrong to want a story with very strong, independent-minded characters that come alive through the acting and not just their physical traits? Many say the movies were invented to tell stories like Avatar, and I cannot disagree with that since film is a visual medium and Avatar is that. But, there are times when it is all visual and the substance to support everything else falls to the wayside in order for Cameron to dazzle and amaze our eyes. This I do not mind, but I wanted a nice balance of visuals and plot.<br/><br/>With all the incredible visual touches, it is unfortunate to not get a more original storyline. Basically, this is 'Dances With Wolves' meets Star Wars 150 years in the future. The dialog is quite silly at times and the emotions of the characters are amazing in how they swing so strong from one scene to another. It is too bad such emotional and vital actors like Sigourney Weaver are hidden behind motion-picture technology while wooden actors like Sam Worthington are allowed to take center stage.<br/><br/>Yes, I know, I am being too hard and critical of this movie. But then again, Cameron is being very ambitious. This is by no means a bad movie, but I think it will be remembered for its influence in technological aspects rather than being a landmark film; this did not change movies forever. I admire Cameron so much as a director, but it is Cameron the writer that gets lost in his own world at times. Still, seeing it in 3D was quite incredible and I loved watching Zoe Saldana take over every scene she was in. As if you haven't already, it is certainly worth seeing Avatar, but it is not worth heaping all accolades onto it.</div>,\n",

From the stunning landscapes and scenery to the design and appearance of the characters, 'Avatar' really is a visual feast and a pleasure to watch. One of the most visually spectacular films of all time.<br/><br/>It is, however, let down by its shallow and uninspiring storyline - a storyline that almost feels secondary to the CGI and special effects and struggles to justify the near 3 hour running length. That said, the flaws in the plot don't really take anything away from the enjoyment of this film, which is still a pleasure to watch.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's \"Avatar\" is a first class example of style over substance. It has some really cornball (and sometimes atrocious) dialogue, a very thin story pulled out of betters like \"Dances With Wolves\" and \"Star Wars,\" and puts more of its emphasis on its visual brilliance. It is very much like the two \"Transformers\" pictures in some sense. But what separates them on the rift of good and bad? \"Avatar\" was blessed to be developed and cared-for by a master: James Cameron the same genius who made the first two Terminator pictures, \"Aliens,\" and \"Titanic.\" In the hands of a lesser director, \"Avatar\" may have ended up being nothing more than just something to look at. But because Cameraon is in the director's chair, the movie (and audience) is subjected to his inventiveness and energetic style.<br/><br/>Cameron's science-fiction epic is basically \"Dances With Wolves\" set in outer space. Instead of Kevin Costner adopting the culture of the plains Native Americans, we have rising star Sam Worthington adopting the culture, lifestyle, and physical appearance of the Na'vi: a catlike race of humanoids living in the savage, jungle world of Pandora. A power-hungry billionaire (Giovanni Ribisi) wants to move out the Na'vi and exploit their resources, so he has his top scientist (Sigourney Weaver) develop a machine allowing people to control an Na'vi avatar. In other words, they sit down in a machine, their brain hooks to a Na'vi body, and they can live as a Na'vi and thus, try to talk them into terms. But of course, the stranger is first appalled by the strange people and then begins to understand and cherish them and he finds himself fighting against his own people.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" is not significant in terms of its story, as I have made very clear. But it *is* significant in terms of its visual splendor. It's not simply because James Cameron revolutionized the era of computer graphics and digital effects. It was because he used them with ingenuity and imagination and used this to create a world. Pandora is marvelously dreamed-up. It's not enough to imagine aliens and alien technology, but types of plants, insects, and creatures. Herbivores and carnivores. And the fact that Cameron treats this like a real, majestic other world is what I really found invigorating in \"Avatar.\" He used his effects with imagination, not banality. He's entertaining, not commercializing.<br/><br/>The first half of the picture consists of understanding this world. The second half consists of a vicious and heart-pumping battle between the primitive people and the advanced people. And even though the denouement is clear to anybody familiar with this type of story, we nevertheless become tense as it rages on without control. But it is controlled and that's why it works.<br/><br/>So why is not a good movie and not a great one? Well, there are a couple of reasons. First of all, the story is very predictable. Secondly, the dialogue is in a word, lame. Just consider my favorite part in the movie. Stephen Lang plays a battle-scarred general. In one scene, he is lecturing to new recruits about Pandora. He screams at them with menace: \"Everything out in that jungle wants to kill you and eat your eyes like jujubes!\" Okay. Now the first half of that sentence was menacing and effective; the second half was its harebrained death. In addition, the 161-minute running time is much too long and had it gone on any longer, I might have found \"Avatar\" exhausting. There are also too many characters for me to care about.<br/><br/>I suppose my review for \"Avatar\" sounds a little mixed, but this is a movie that I encourage people to see, just for the sheer visual experience of it. True, if you took out the visual splendor, there would not be much left, with it, this is quite an experience. Yes, the story did not ring my bell, but the energy and imagination in creating this fantastic world really got me. And it was truly great to see Sigourney Weaver in another invention science-fiction gem.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Newspaper resident right-wing spleen merchants have written this movie off as a product of James Cameron's hippie sensibilities (Nature good, Civilisation bad) but the plot is so ordinary it is not likely to have much persuasive value. Visually it is something else. With Planet Pandora (technically a moon), Cameron, inspired by the Amazonian rain forest and Jurassic Park, not only has created a 3-D world of beauty and splendour, he has staged some truly spectacular action sequences, particularly in the air (Harry Potter and his flying broomsticks on steroids). The average viewer is going to be swept away by this, not by the clunky plot, which revolves around a mining venture on a distant planet being obstructed by the locals who are justifiably upset by the intrusion.<br/><br/>What upsets the Right's cheer brigade is the \"simplistic\" portrayal of the military as moronic thugs, when we have all those brave men and women out there defending freedom and our oil supplies price in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since this is a science fiction fable the analogy is likely to be lost on most viewers – they are more likely to see it as a steal from \"GI Joe\"). As Jake Sully, the central character who changes sides in the battle, Sam Worthington is not a traitor to his race, as the cartoonish Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) calls him, but someone who realises that what is being done to the planet and its people in the quest for \"unobatinium\" is morally unjustified. Perhaps our columnists would like to take a look at what has been done to the environment and population by mining in New Guinea, for example.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the politics, Sam Worthington has just the presence for his part. It was nice to see Sigorney Weaver, an old hand in Cameron movies, back as the crusty but likable scientist Dr Grace. I also liked Giovanni Ribisi as Selfridge the mine manager once I realized he wasn't Jerry Seinfeld. He was the epitome of the corporate shyster. The unsung heroes of all this are the animation and special effects people , hundreds of them including Weta of NZ, who have put their experience in Lord of the Rings to good use.<br/><br/>To revert to the political, we might ask why there is an apparent \"left wing\" bias in Hollywood movies. The answer of course is that the Right have no imagination, a vital attribute for a successful innovative movie maker. Cameron might write clunky plots and corny dialogue, but there's nothing wrong with his visual imagination, and he has the ability to engage the primal fears of his audience, if not their intellects, and to entertain.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Sigh. Where to begin. This movie - the story I mean - had enormous problems right from the start. Jake's brother gets killed for \"the paper in his wallet\"? What, paper money in 2154?? And where exactly did he get killed? On Pandora? A small corporate-military-scientific installation? Crawling with common thieves/murderers? Come on!<br/><br/>And it goes on from there. All sorts of questions relating to the events and characters are never explained. What on Earth is unobtainium (an unoriginal term) used for, since it's so expensive? No explanation. The characters are total cardboards, incapable of mustering any audience identification or sympathy, with no cool lines, no good acting performances (except Zöe Saldana's), no nothing. The story is predictable and made up of clichés. I liked the \"Gaia plug-in\" thing they had, but having all the animals rise to the occasion at the end was just too Disney. The greatest plot hole was that the military could just have nuked the site instead of using a conventional assault. When they get back there next time, they'll probably do exactly that. So no proper closure, nor believable behavior, given the available technology.<br/><br/>There were some cool scenes, sure. But without a good story and good characters and capable actors, cool action is utterly meaningless. This was a pretty package with no substance, just what you expect from average, mainstream Hollywood fare, made by a director who's compromised his integrity for money. The script sounded like Cameron wrote it when he was twelve, way waaay before getting around to mature and masterful work like Aliens and Abyss.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that, because it contains something new (the CGI), will be a big hit now, but in just a few years it will be outdone by other movies and quickly look dated, and the cheesy story will relegate it to history's dung heap, deservedly forgotten.<br/><br/>I had hoped this would be the SF movie of the decade. As it is, it's unintelligent schlock which will probably be toe-cringing to sit through a second time. What a freaking shame. 2009 only had four really good SF movies: District 9, Star Trek, Surrogates and Battle for Terra (which may have been made in 2007, but was released in 2009 - it is a much better version of Avatar than Avatar). Avatar certainly doesn't make my top-250 - nowhere near.<br/><br/>6 out of 10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I will certainly not argue that this is a highly entertaining film. But again with a lot of films of this type recently, the script gradually takes a back seat to the visuals. The premise of the story is a good one, and I admire Cameron for giving us a relatively original plot from which to tell his story via CGI. However, there were still a few problems with the script. Like many of movies of this type, the script seemed a couple of re-writes away from being an absolutely phenomenal story. There were a few too many aspects that started ringing of Aliens and Titanic, both of which Cameron wrote and directed. And there were glaring holes in some of the story but instead the action sequences were overlong almost to cover-up the lack of development, particularly in regards to the mineral substance sought-after by the corporate baddies. <br/><br/>The basic plot is pretty complex. American white capitalists are exploiting Pandora, a world that is a cross between the jungles of modern-day Africa, the world of the dinosaurs 100 million years ago, and the unpredictability of Wall Street. Some of the creatures that habituate the planet are crosses between dinosaurs, reptiles, mammals, and Enron Corporation. At one point a character says you could get a little rest and relaxation in Hell after being on Pandora. Nestled inside this wilderness are a race of green humanoids resembling something that could pass for an ancient African or Native American tribe with a little bit of Vulcan added for good measure, called the Na'vi. They reside inside a giant tree that would give the Empire State Building a run for its money. <br/><br/>Trouble is the Tree (aka Hometree) contains a mineral that's supposed to be worth $20 million per 2\" x 2\" x 2\" cube, which would mean that one the size of a bowling ball would be enough to buy the entire state of Rhode Island or the estate of Bill Gates. But this is one of the holes in the script: What the hell is this stuff and why is it potentially worth more than all the that pops up on \"Antiques Roadshow\" and \"Pawn Stars\" combined? This is never explained. I think we are given only one line about the mineral and left to speculate ourselves, and the subject never comes up again. Of course this is a gaping hole as the whole premise is based on the immense desirability of this stuff! The man in charge of the corporate interests of the operation, Parker Selfridge, seemed a clone of Carter Burke from Aliens. (I notice their first names seem like a last names!) Like Burke he is only interested in the capital gain of mining the mineral. The native people, of course, are going to get screwed.<br/><br/>A crippled soldier, Jake Sully, who lost the use of his legs in the Marines, is hired to place his consciousness inside an \"avatar\", a life-like replica of one of the Na'vi and infiltrate their society and culture to see if an agreement can be reached between the money-hungry corporation and the Na'vi. The agreement is the native tribe is being evicted from their Tree, without even a written 30-day notice. The better part of the film is Sully learning about the Na'vi. That aspect worked relatively well, although there were characteristics of the Na'vi that seemed so much like either idealized Native American or Ancient African culture that it was getting a bit deja-vu all over again. My favorite moment is the relationship between the Na'vi and the winged beasts, the Toruk, and how the Na'vi tame them. Later, the scientists discover that much of the planet is interconnected like a giant organism but again the idea is neither developed nor resolved.<br/><br/>The baddies are led by a colonel who is so replete with over-the-top military cliché I half-expected to see him worshipping at a shrine to General Patton. He would probably feel right at home in the company of Atilla the Hun. (Again he was very similar to Cameron's character from Titanic, Spicer Lovejoy, who is just pure evil even when the ship is sinking! Without giving it away, there is a similar scene in Avatar.) Which points to what I think is the biggest problem I had with the final confrontation of the horrible white corporation with the wonderful Na'vi. The Na'vi seemed to have very little dark aspects to them and the baddies had almost no redeeming qualities barring the scientists and Sully. For those who like their bad guys and good guys very well-defined, this is your kind of movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I predicted the last 20 minutes of the film during the first 20 minutes. The ending needed something unexpected that also tied up the loose ends concerning the valuable mineral and the idea of interconnected consciousness of life on Pandora. I speculated that the corporation might earn greater profit from fostering this idea of interconnected consciousness, but nope. They don't listen to reason and simply go for the jugular. Probably the first one-half to three-quarters of this film were exceptional. The last quarter became a slash-and-bang shoot-em-up action video game. Sort of a Spaghetti Western in space. The ending needed to transcend itself to meet the very interesting rhetoric of the middle of the story. But of course that probably would have meant cutting down the action sequences, God forbid.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">...I'll burn a few words on James \"I'm king of the world\" Cameron's latest epic sfx extravaganza. I'll not bother the reader with a recitation of the formulaic plot (which has been parsed to death here on the IMDb and elsewhere) and stereotypical characters (all of which conform to standard Campbellian norms), but rather will expound a bit on a comparison of the 3D theatrical and the 2D home video experiences.<br/><br/>Simply put, \"Avatar\" is a big-screen 3D event; the 2D home version, though beautiful, in no way matches the theatrical experience. My observation is that reducing the size of the image and flattening it only emphasizes the CGI, turning \"Avatar\" into more of an animated feature than it already is. The work is still pretty much seamless, and extremely effective, but there's something about the diminishment of the screen and the loss of depth that brings out the artificial nature of the visuals, particularly in some of the movements of the Na'vi (which looked absolutely fine on the big screen, btw). I've noticed this effect before in a number of CGI-fests, including Peter Jackson's remake of \"King Kong\" and his \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. Even Mauro \"The Kingdom\" Fiore's fluid DP work and Cameron, etal's editing can't completely conceal the artifice underpinning the sumptuous, downright brilliant art and production design (shades of Roger Dean, for certain). \"Avatar\" absolutely depends on 3D presentation to adequately disguise the current limitations of CGI.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it's a fine popcorn movie with absolutely no surprises beyond the visual. I admire Cameron for having done it; now please do something with a little more substance to it, ala \"The Abyss.\"<br/><br/>3/1/11 edit: Caught up to the 3-disc DVD presentation with the various deleted scenes (most of which were extraneous and excised for good reason), as well as a fascinating \"making-of\" documentary which I highly recommend. I'm actually looking forward to Cameron's 3D retrofitting of \"Titanic\" now. I love watching that ship sink.<br/><br/>2.27.13 edit: Finally caught this on 3D HDTV and was impressed. The 3D was excellent, reaffirming its value opposed to 2D presentation.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">My Take: A jaw-dropping and visually-thrilling experience. An event movie that lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>Watching and judging a movie primarily on its special effects would seem like a shallow way to look at movie-making, but for movies like James Cameron's latest AVATAR (A pet-project of his since he became \"king-of-the-world\" in TITANIC), you can't help but get carried away by the brilliant visual magic in place. But I mean that in the best way, because you don't only see AVATAR as an event movie, you experience it as an event itself. Since I saw the movie in Digital 3-D, I don't know how AVATAR would fare in 2-D. But I'll have you this: 3-D is the best possible way to see this movie, if not THE only way to see it. The last time I saw a movie on 3-D was the awful G-FORCE, which had me exhausted with wearing those glasses in the first 15 minutes (let alone, 88 minutes). Well, I wore those glasses for almost three hours in AVATAR, and I never got tired. Here's a movie where 3-D doesn't only enhance the already impressive effects, it also enhances the story into a full-blown experience.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of people (critics mostly) complaining that the plot was mundane, but Cameron was the first to admit that this would be an old-fashioned adventure story. Along with the many old-fashioned stories, there are also several allusions to Cameron's ALIENS, 2007's BATTLE FOR TERRA, KING KONG, DANCES WITH WOLVES, and even POCAHONTAS as well as some of the \"save the rain forest\" elements of FERNGULLY: THE LAST RAINFOREST. At first, Sam Worthington had me a little nervous as the hero, but he turned out to be just fine as Jake Sully, a paraplegic wheelchair-bound Marine who must continue his brother's task to study the inhabitants of a beautiful yet dangerous moon called Pandora called the Na'Vi, by infiltrating their environments by means of replicates called Avatars. Their mission is to study these humanoid natives so that the company he serves will know how to extract Unobtainium, a precious rock-like material, hidden somewhere in the moon. But this is just the movie's McGuffin as the story focuses more on Jake's love for the beautiful forests of Pandora, his appreciation for its culture, his romance with a Na'Vi warrior Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and eventually the battle to save the planet from the greed of humanity.<br/><br/>Cameron has been known to push the envelope in his movies, but after TITANIC (still a placeholder for #1 highest-grossing movie of all time), how could he possibly top anything that he had done before? Well AVATAR not only lives up to the hype before it, it may have even surpassed it. AVATAR has been dubbed a \"game-changer\", and visually, it might be. The technology used in AVATAR is not only impressive, it might just change the way we see movies in the future (if ever this would be topped). Motion-capture has been done several times before, but (maybe with a few exceptions) no other film has done it so perfectly. The CGI avatars (so to speak) are not some dead-eyed CGI critter, you care for them as if they were more human than the actual flesh-and-blood characters on-screen. Cameron not only waited for the right technology to make AVATAR (this was supposed to be done back in 1999 after TITANIC, but the technology wouldn't allow it), he made sure it was perfect. Call him a perfectionist, but don't say he doesn't succeed. But you'd think, with all the visual hokus-pokus he had in his hands, Cameron might just be another George Lucas. But his years in hiatus has not stopped him from being a professional storyteller. Old-fashioned or not, he tells the story in the most spectacular way possible. From the opening scenes to the spectacular, eye-popping finale, AVATAR never lets up for 3 hours (actually, 162 minutes). It's gonna be hard to top this one, maybe even for Cameron himself! <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Classic story with nothign added. Literally. As soon as it starts (when you get to know the main characters) you already know: not the ending (which is often easily guessed in Hollywood movies) but EVERY.SINGLE.BEAT. You know how characters would react at every single thing. Its INSANE how nobody read the script and said: \"Ok, we should at least change ONE thing from the generic draft we got in day one\".<br/><br/>No time because of VISUALS! Look. I didn't even like this supposedly great blue world. But that doesn't matter. You can still say: \"I loved the effects\" and not contradict yourself with \"but the movie is AWFUL\". Because the movie is AWFUL.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I was truly impressed with the magnificent cinematography and superb animation of this extravaganza. The mighty –yet peaceful smurfs of James Cameron, supported by such notable voices as Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver, live in the Land of Blue-Oz. They really don't do much other than ride around on Star War figures and fly huge scaly mosquitoes and talk some stupid made up gibberish. The happy-go-lucky residents of Blue-Oz are living their meaningless lives in the jungles of stupid, when some evil no-good Marine working for the evil corporation drops in unannounced and starts digging around for Unobtanium, or Unacquirable, or Not-getting-anium, and just messes up their entire social structure. What is even worse, the Marine (Sam Worthington) is transformed into a cartoon – ahem – to play amongst the other blue cartoon characters. Smurf me with your best shot. I was so smurfing confused by all of what was happening. Well the plot goes on from there with all sorts of goofy Tarzan screams and smurf-onics, waking and sleeping, yelling and whispering, tail entanglements and monkey-walking. Finally we find that it just so happens that the tree that Papa-Smurf planted so long ago is the same, exact location of this very rare stuff. From this point they could have mined the plot and found plenty of Unobtanium. This movie had potential\n",
       " and it is obvious kids who have not yet left home - really liked this flick. If a person dislikes all things corporate (wakey – wakey Johnny – that DOES include Hollywood) and has a great disdain for the military\n",

       " anything Cameron does now-a-days is a waste of time.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is story about planet Pandora which is inhabited by intelligent aliens. These Aliens are more close to their mother Planet from anything else in a supernatural way. They are not advanced in terms of technology (yeah that's what we call on earth). Humans arrive on this planet to search of an element precious to them in terms of money. They have 'Avatar's' built which copy genome of these aliens. They look like aliens but have mind of a human. Avatar's are built to build relations with natural habitat on Pandora. One of the Avatar's gets too close to these aliens and joins them to protect their planet from arrived humans.<br/><br/>Pros: Awesome natural visuals belonging to other planet. The seven words that u just read cover up for every con. Idea of overlapped connection.. i mean creating a altogether different creature in appearance(Avatar). Special bonding via Connection of typical organ. The connection bundles into tremendous energy when every being on planet kind of meditates in front of sacred tree. The scene in which they surround the sacred tree and meditate is tremendous. Finally Mother Nature defending itself literally rushes ones adrenalin high. The elements like sacred flower, respect to the prey and ceremony to say bye to deceased ones add to the natural element.<br/><br/>Cons: Human race is shown too negative, if this were the case I doubt they could have survived elsewhere. The set up in which Avatar gets active should have bought up with more restrictions, I mean the entire body was made available for locomotion even in dream state and a connection terminated without caution would have resulting in death could have been a good idea. Aliens were thought to be not that intelligent (I mean while attacking they did not thought of flying. To add further 6th was human to figure out flight on that giant bird, OK I take back the later point.)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">For being 10 times the amount of money I would normally spend on a movie, I had hoped that this would be worth it. As per my previous stance on 3-D, I was hesitant on going to this film when it first came out. However, since I did some reading up on what forces went on behind this film, I decided to give the 3-D experience a try. What an experience it was! I can see why the film industry was really pushing for more movies to be in 3-D because it is spectacular. The glasses weren't uncomfortable, and if you took them off for a second, it wasn't a terrible color-shifted image, it was just slightly blurry. Although, one thing that 3-D cinema is going to have to fix is to have more things in focus. You can't rely on previous film-making techniques here.<br/><br/>At any rate, if you can get over the blatantly anti-corporation and anti-military message, it's really quite a good movie and should be seen due at least to the fact that this is the reason James Cameron got into making movies in the first place. We can all blame him for ripping off Dances with Wolves (1990) or Pocahontas (1995) but if you can get past that, there's a great movie here, regardless.<br/><br/>What really stands out with this film is its visuals. Despite the amount of CGI used to create the fictional world of Pandora, it's incredibly difficult to tell what is CGI and what is merely a human in front of a green screen. Just by the strength of these visuals alone, this film should be viewed by movie aficionados. Not only was the 3-D technology used to film it revolutionary, but the facial mapping techniques really helped bring these actors to life in their blue, alien bodies.<br/><br/>A stunning visual treat that has yet to be matched, I give Avatar 4.5 stars out of 5.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">AVATAR is a visual feast. And at an estimated $280 million to make, it had better be. James Cameron, best known for spending as much money as he can on a project (see TITANIC and his other flicks that have given him the nickname \"The $200 million dollar man\"), leads the way again as writer/director. And with him comes Aussie actor Sam Worthington who also starred in Cameron's TERMINATOR SALVATION film.<br/><br/>As stated at the beginning, this is a highly stylized, visual film that has 3-D effects galore. You feel like you're riding on the back of some faraway creature as it dives through clouds, brushes the forest tops, and skims floating cliff faces. It is THIS that gives most, if not all, of the film's entertainment punch. If you didn't see it in 3-D, then you're missing out on the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>But where the film falls down is its story. This film is basically a rip-off of two ideas: DANCES WITH WOLVES and Frank Herbert's lesser known Pandora series of books. In fact, Wes Studi, who starred in Dances With Wolves as a tough Pawnee Indian, holds a similar role here in Avatar as the roughshod Eytukan. Granted, this is a space epic, but the transfer of ideas from Dances With Wolves still holds very true: A white man comes into native country, battles with them, learns to respect them, switches allegiances, helps save the natives from complete annihilation. This is pure Dances With Wolves.<br/><br/>As far as Frank Herbert's Pandora series goes, there's quite a few similarities. The first big one is the planet. In both Frank's and Cameron's universes, the planet is called Pandora. Nothing to get in a fuss about since the mythology of Pandora is well known since the time of the early Greeks. But where the similarities merge is with the planet itself. In both universes, the planet is alive. Literally. And this living force has a name. On Frank Herbert's Pandora, it is a life force known as Avata (hmmm, that sounds familiar too). On Cameron's Pandora, it is known as Eywa. Both planets are hostile to humans but are valuable in their own way (for Frank Herbert is was the expansion of humanity, and for James Cameron a rich mineral source).<br/><br/>So for those out there that are touting how \"original\" this is, I think you just haven't remembered (or weren't around) when actor/director Kevin Costner filmed his western epic and/or haven't read Frank Herbert's Pandora series (starting with Destination: Void and going through The Ascension Factor).<br/><br/>All this being said, Avatar is entertaining. It has that big-screen appeal and escapism that so many movie-goers pine for. And it has some of the best visual effects you'll ever see. But just don't tell me it's \"original.\"</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The movie includes sci fi, action, adventure, drama, fantasy, war and romance with a happy end and nice music. So it's versatile and appeals to a very large audience. The film is from 2009 and is visually appealing, but the quality of CGI is not as good as, for example, \"The Lord of the Rings\" of 2001.\n",
       " I saw the theatrical version (162 minutes) and I liked the movie, but not very much. The last 40 minutes I could not concentrate anymore, which is why the movie was too long for me.<br/><br/>I'm a science fiction fan and the focus here is on fantasy.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">While I have read comparisons of Avatar to \"Dances With Wolves\" on this website, it's really more of a merging of \"A Man Called Horse\" and \"The Return of a Man Called Horse\". While frequently technically amazing, some of the CGI appears downright \"Disneyesque\". Performances are fine, especially Zoe Saldana and Steven Lang.<br/><br/>The \"religious right\" has called \"Avatar\" everything from \"pagan\" to \"communist,\" the movie is about as controversial as \"The Lion King\" or \"Tarzan\". James Cameron has again provided he is the world's most skilled \"techno-director.\" James Horner's music is not up to his usual memorable standards, and the musical theme is totally forgettable.<br/><br/>I give \"Avatar\" an \"8\".</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"Avatar\" is like nothing you have seen before, and perhaps the signature of things to come. \"Avatar\" is beautifully stunning. In one scene Na'vi Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) ride winged creatures as they careen through the Floating Mountains of Pandora. Breathtaking. I saw \"Avatar\" in Real 3D, and it is spectacular and amazing. The visual 3D is seamless—\"Avatar\" is just a gorgeous movie to watch. Director and Writer James Cameron tells the story of the transformation of hero. As envisioned by Cameron, the hero Jake emerges out of his tribe and nature's cyber network. Grace (strong Sigourney Weaver) points out that the Na'vi are networked through the trees of Pandora; thus, having more connections than the human brain.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" is like American Indian mythology where the people see the value of harmony with the spirit of the land, and being protectors of it. Sam Worthington as Jake is compassionate and commanding in his journey of the hero. As in most classic stories, he is a reluctant hero at first. Beautiful and strong Na'vi Neytiri (Saldana) tells Jake's avatar after saving his life, \"You have a strong heart. Fearless\n",
       "  And so stupid!\" <br/><br/>Jake (Worthington) is a paraplegic Marine in the year 2154 sent to Pandora to participate in an experiment. Jake replaces his twin brother, who was a scientist that had died, as Avatar for his Na'vi body. He along with lead scientist Grace (Weaver) become avatars for bodies grown from Na'vi and human DNA. The Na'vi are the tribal people that inhabit the planet Pandora which is light years from earth. Pandora possesses the mineral Unobtainium (kind of cheesy) that is worth millions of dollars on earth. The Na'vi live on a tree over the largest source of the precious ore. The Na'vi are blue skinned beautiful and sinuous people standing 10 feet tall. And according to Marine Col. Miles Quaritch (awesome Stephen Lang) the Na'vi also have carbon fiber skeletal structures which makes them \"very hard to kill\". Jake is part of the diplomatic solution. However, Quaritch enlists Jake as his Marine Na'vi to learn about the enemy and distinguish their weakness. In return Jake gets his legs back.<br/><br/>Jake as Na'vi soon finds himself falling in love with the stunningly beautiful Neytiri (Saldana), daughter of Shaman Chief Eytukan (Wes Studi). Jake becomes Na'vi, and sees the value of this noble people, and their spiritual and physical bond to Pandora itself. So the Avatar of the cyber world must choose whether he becomes the Avatar, chosen one, of his new people. In this Cameron's storytelling is compelling. Worthington is strong and compassionate. Saldana is noble and vulnerable. Their chemistry is amazing as Jake confesses to Neytiri, \"I see you.\"<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" apparently cost $300 million dollars to make. I understand since inception about 10 years ago along with development of motion capture technology the cost may approach half a billion dollars. Looks like all that effort has been worth it. We truly get the emotions of the actors in their expression. The Na'vi move so languidly and fluidly. Cameron's \"Avatar\" is a visually stunning and classic hero story—the likes of which have never been seen before.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is another special effects extravaganza from director James Cameron. A lot of money was spent on making this film, but it payed off. Avatar is now the most successful film ever. Though I didn't like the film a lot I still thought it was impressive on the technical level. The problem is that it's not as gripping as some of Cameron's other films like Aliens or Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Avatar turns out to be Dances With Wolves, but in space.<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing. The CGI makes the world of Pandora come alive. There's some breathtaking scenery in the film. The actors were good in their roles. Sam Worthington as Sully is effective in the leading role. I especially liked Stephen Lang in the role of Quaritch. I also liked the film's message. The script does not impress though, and parts of the film just don't entertain. There's so much CGI that for a while I yearned to see something normal. Thankfully the many millions of dollars spent on making Avatar were spent wisely. This film is so much better than, let's say, Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen. Overall Avatar is a good and entertaining science fiction epic. I recommend it.</div>,\n",

Avatar is definitely worth seeing, but the greatest enjoyment you'll get from seeing it is from experiencing the fantasy world of \"Pandora\" - not from traditional movie elements like performances, plot, dialog, themes, etc. Of course, those are all there and they are very well done, it's just that they're not what makes this movie great.<br/><br/>Being exposed to a spectacular alien landscape with vivid colors, 3-dimensional perspective, fantastical creatures big and small, intricately detailed imagery and exotic locations is a large part of what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>If the visuals of the movie were any less strong or the acting/script/etc. were not strong enough to support the world Cameron created, the movie could easily have been a disaster.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend watching this in the theater because after watching the previews on TV, you're definitely going to lose a lot of the ambiance and atmosphere by watching it on a small screen. I plan to see it in the theater again.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"Avatar\" is a colorful, action-packed, trite film. There's a lot of money up on the screen. With all that dough you could, oh, say, rescue the environment, if that was what you wanted to do. I can see, though, why James Cameron decided to devote all that cash to yet another special-effects bonanza and teen boy adventure story. The most repugnant aspect of this film is the false sense of moral righteousness it works to generate in its fanboy base. White, heterosexual, American Marines – bad. All the rest of the peace-loving world – good. Uh rah.<br/><br/>The Navi are the noble savages. Just curious – did Cameron get it that his noble savages' name was one letter away from \"Nazi,\" and did he care? The Navi are meant to be just like Native Americans, traditional Africans, and Aborigines, that is, the Native Americans, etc, who exist in guilty white liberal imaginations. They're really in tune with nature, unlike the evil white male Marines. Now, see, the rest of us could be in tune with nature, too, if it were the nature of this movie. In \"Avatar\" nature is bright turquoise, lime green, and the dirt glows in the dark when you step on it. Vividly-patterned pterodactyls serve as natural airplanes the heroes ride through the sky. There's no sexism; women are warriors and chiefs. And they all have really high breasts and no fat on their stomachs. Who wouldn't prefer this nature to traffic jams and multiplexes? In real life, of course, nature produces not just pretty, turquoise-colored creatures, but also dirt that does not glow in the dark. In real indigenous tribes, gang rape and female infanticide are rampant, and females are not warriors who speak their minds boldly, but cowed servants who keep their eyes down around the men of the tribe. Children's bellies swell with intestinal worms. Famine, frost, flood, and plague are constant challenges.<br/><br/>In real life, indigenous people are warriors who make endless war on neighboring tribes, often subjecting captives to torture and slavery. And indigenous people have proved all too eager to adopt every poison that modernity churns out.<br/><br/>Avatar's ironies never seem to stop. Pandora is an invented world, and Cameron could have created a peaceful tribe that achieves its goals through diplomacy, charm, magic, or through superior intellect. But no. Even while bashing the US military, Cameron turns his heroes, the Navi, into warriors who drive off the US military with bows and arrows. Yeah, that's believable. Even if you suspend your disbelief, you can't get around the gross irony.<br/><br/>In real life, fanboys would burst into hysterical sobbing if they were forced to surrender their grip on their electronic toys and live close to any nature, even the glow-in-the-dark, more-Disney-than-Disney nature of this film.<br/><br/>And isn't anyone out there tired, yet, of all the trite bashing of white men, military men, Americans, and Western Civilization? Given the grosses of this film, I guess the answer is obviously no.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar has been out for a few weeks now and the general vibe is that the film is better than people were expecting. I must admit when I saw the trailers for Avatar I wasn't desperate to queue up during the first few days it was playing. I was therefore pleasantly surprised when I finally got around to seeing it.<br/><br/>Avatar tells the story in the future where the human race are mining other planets. The local inhabitants take second priority over the main task of recovering the resources for earth. Pandora is a moon of the planet Polythemus and Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is sent to take over his dead brothers Avatar. The atmosphere on Pandora is noxious, so humans can only explore by using an Avatar which is a human-navi mix. Jake is paralysed, but the Avatar gives him the opportunity to walk again. Whilst some of the crew such as Grace (Sigourney Weaver) wish to understand more about the navi, most just want to blast them away and take what they've come for.<br/><br/>The obvious stand out feature of the film is the technology. This is the first 3d film where I've really felt immersed in the film. It is extremely impressive and Cameron has obviously been fairly obsessive in getting the technology right. There isn't too much of a plot as you can see from above. I enjoyed the film, but I can't help thinking that once the sfx loses it's magic this will be a fairly average film.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I saw the movie in 3D on Friday with my twin sister and a couple of friends, and after that I love it! And you know, this is the first sci-fi film I had ever check.<br/><br/>The film is in the year 2154 on the distant planet Pandora, Jake Sully unexpectedly got involve in a militant experiment because his twin brother was the applicant, but he got shot by a robber. Grace the scientist in charge of the \"Avatar\" project thinks this is a joke, like a paralyzed \"jar-head reject\" with no scientific experience what so ever is as part of this project. And about the Avatar experiment: it is basically a...neuro-DNA transference in which the consciousness is transfer in the body that looks like one the planet's natives known as the Na'vi. The Na'vi are humanoids aliens standing at 9 feet (2.7 m) tall, with tails, bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber, and bioluminescent blue skin. Of course I think the avatar bodies are fake.<br/><br/>During his experience in the Avatar project, Jake (like a \"Wow! this is cool\" kid) enjoys the experience in his Avatar shape; though it made the recovery crew nervous for him walking too fast, and for the first time in his life, Jake could run, walk and feel the soil between the toes. The next day, Colonel Miles Quaritch orders Jake to gain the trust of the Na'vi to convince them to abandon their \"Hometree,\" which sits above a large deposit of unobtanium. And in return Quaritch would give Jake the money for his leg surgery. And while Jake is escorting Grace and a biologist named Norm Spellman, the group got attacked by a large predator. Jake becomes separated from the others and has to survive Pandora's dangerous wildlife, and saved by a female Na'vi named Neytiri. When some floating seeds attaching to himself she sees it as a spiritual sign from Eywa (their mother goddess) and takes him to the Na'vi Hometree, where her clan, the Omaticaya, live. And the Na'vi decide to teach Jake their ways. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.<br/><br/>Overall, I really love this film and its glowing, neon colors for the planet's forest at night; also for the \"Tree of Souls.\"</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">In its core, Avatar is a mediocre movie, a retold Pocahontas story in a futuristic setting, the sci-fi element adding very little to the message that screams at the viewer on a minutely basis. Character development is minimal, the dialog trite and recycled. While it could be argued that T2 - still Cameron's greatest movie - was more or less the same, that movie excelled in pacing its action scenes, and in incorporating style and humor in a way that Avatar never does, rather than just in visual effects.<br/><br/>Having said all that - none of it can reduce anything from the technological and visual triumph Avatar achieved. which is so much more impressive when viewed on a big screen with the 3D goggles. Cameron and co. created a fully formed world, more convincing and more real than anything seen before, with gorgeous fantastical landscapes and atmosphere, and incredibly imaginary yet totally realistic creatures and plants, and draws the viewer in completely, just like the main character is drawn into a reality that's not his own. Too bad none of the characters are compelling enough to give that connection any real meaning.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">New James Cameron's film AVATAR is an epic that mixes Sci-fi, drama, adventure, fantasy all together, which joined to the 3D technology was really a new and pleasant experience to me. I liked the 3D feature, but most of all I did appreciate the plot and the story which was told. That was one thing I thought I wouldn't like\n",
       "  In fact I was afraid I would enjoy the 3D experience provided by this movie but would dislike the plot, but it didn't happen, at all! <br/><br/>AVATAR tells us a story of fantasy in a distant world called PANDORA where Humans seek for a precious mineral which back to Earth would be worth millions. Their greed is so big that they don't care if they have to destroy its nature and a native race called NA'VI\n",
       "  However they send an Avatar (a body with NA'VI's shape but controlled by a human) trying to make the NA'VI get out of their land peacefully in order to the Humans get the mineral without nobody getting hurt. But of course they don't, it's their land, for god's sake! So Humans need to use force, and a battle between races begins! <br/><br/>So, in short words, that's AVATAR's plot, but what I found more interesting in all that is that behind all that fantasy, all those strange animals, vegetables and race we can easily link what happened in PANDORA to what really happened in Human history! I really think there're too many bonds between this epic tale and all what happened when European civilizations discovered, conquered and colonized America to pass unnoticed. In fact didn't the European force all native cultures to their rules, destroying those who opposed them defending their lands? And if we think about the Spaniard greed for gold in South America which conduced them to destroy advanced civilizations, as the Aztec or the Inca, we can easily compare the tale in AVATAR to the real facts of history (the difference is that real history facts' disclosure was not the same of the movie\n",
       " ) <br/><br/>Therefore, in my point of view, AVATAR has this merit of being a great fantasy epic tale which is inspired in real Human history. And it provides an extra dose of interest, veracity and emotion, at least for me\n",
       "  <br/><br/>Not being a brilliant movie AVATAR is a good one providing entertainment, action and emotion to the very ending moments\n",
       "  I score it 8/10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Milestones in cinema can be fabricated products, tailored by huge, complex, and wide spread corporations, fighting for gaining attentions, and selling a product. So, now we have this Avatar, which has been announced as the next big thing, for several months, years perhaps. On those matters alone, that means this is a fabricated groundbreaking product, it is not Citizen Kane, nor even Jazz Singer. It probably is more of a Gone with the Wind.<br/><br/>But there is a film here. And it matters to watch it, beyond the package of marketing and brainless mass opposed opinions.<br/><br/>There are several evident strong things here. One is how Cameron outdid Zemeckis in achieving a certain realism that grows out of real people, abstracted into animation, only to be delivered to us again as realistic animated characters. That game Zemeckis played on Polar Express. This film tops what has been done so far. I don't know whether this business of emulating reality through purely digital medium will have an interesting future, how much is there to explore with interest? But this is our high point so far.<br/><br/>Another thing is how this film cements what Peter Jackson had done with King Kong, and several action features have worked since: action films are spatial pieces nowadays. That is already and will become more a common place. It will look dated and wobbly any grand scale action/epic/war(?) film which won't consider space occupation. That is where the 3d will take its place. On my few remarks on 3d cinema, i noted how its biggest possibilities are precisely in how the 3d enhances and creates the space, physical space, built with distances, where the action will happen. So, Pandora, the forest, is built to be spatially explored. Right from the beginning, on the waterfall, the battle to destroy the big tree, and pretty much all the action that takes place there. 3d is an interesting addition to what a concerned mind (or a group of minds) can do. I hope it becomes a usable tool for the beautiful author minds we have around the world (i wish Welles was here to use it).<br/><br/>Risks where brought down to a very minimum here. The story is just as cliché, recognizable, and thus acceptable as it could be without being shouting unbearable. Well, again it follows a Selznick logic of marketing products which are like what has been done and accepted by the audience, only bigger and better sold.<br/><br/>But surrounding this thin good-evil story, there are pieces of reflexivity, self aware or unintended, which make the process of post-reflection over the film delicious. The more visible one, and assumed, is how the film is to us as the avatar is to its owner. We dig into the reality of the film as the 3 avatar users dig into the reality of Pandora. Fake bodies, inner realities, as if moving down each level was the equivalent of climbing up the big tree. One intended thing is when we consider the commentary in the film (social, ecological, moral) against the contradictions the film itself displays. It turns the wheel of bad guy good guy. At last, it assumes the \"american general\" as the sadist destruction oriented bad guy, perpetrating the same kind of terrorist crimes he was once commissioned to pursue. But than, the tools the film uses to achieve the desired happy ending, which respects the \"alternative\" of the native culture are exactly the tools the overthrown terrorists were using. The film itself is a story of good-evil, not a vessel for layered knowledge, like a tree of souls which uploads the lives of every past human being.<br/><br/>take it for the visual experience. It's not groundbreaking but it is the current status of the best tools we have these days, to explore the emerging worlds of digital animation and 3d cinema. Enjoy the self reference if you appreciate it, but don't be driven away by the useless safe options.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I remember when I first saw Avatar in theatres and I was totally blown away. I remember leaving the theatre just stunned at what I had just been a part of. So I decided to go back for a second viewing and thats when it all came crashing down. Apparently the first time I was just mesmerized by the special effects to truly notice to bad acting,writing and characters.<br/><br/>This movie is about a young crippled man who is sent on an army project to leave his human body and be put into an avatar body. His avatar body is a 8 foot tall alien and soon he makes friends with other 8 foot tall aliens.<br/><br/>When I first saw the previews for the movie I thought it was going to be so great. But with Cameron spending all his money on special effects it lacks solid writing and actors. Frankly when I found out this is going to be a saga I was not impressed I will watch the other ones with hopes that they will improve.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is such a monumental film that relied on CGI in every scene. Though groundbreaking once it came out, it ultimately turned out to be quite forgettable. Obvious message is obvious. Obvious bad guys are obvious. Too simple and cliche to tell an actual solid story.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is everything you've come to expect from today's blockbuster: designed for mass-market appeal; a simplistic time-passer with the emotional weight of the popcorn you spilt in the cinema while marvelling at the effects. I watched this film on blue-ray for the first time rather than the cinema, so maybe that makes a difference, but to me you could basically view the first 15 minutes or so of the movie and then chart out the plot developments on a graph.<br/><br/>I certainly wouldn't knock people who like it, or, like the equally simplistic if technically brilliant Titanic, worship at the altar of its phony emotionalism, but to me the film is an over-earnest, humour-free diatribe about the ecological damage we're doing to our rain-forests, and our planet, while no doubt the capitalists behind it are mass-producing Avatar merchandise from our precious resources to sell by the bucket-load. I'm not sure if it's heartfelt or not but to me it stinks of hypocrisy.<br/><br/>I also thought there's an Iraq war parallel here - \"When somebody is sitting on something you want turn them into an enemy.\" Cameron is back in his futuristic marine-mode from Aliens, and he does conjure some wonderful action beats - it's what he does best after all; but if you really wanted to make a film expressing concerns about our environment, would it not have been better if the Narvi had lost? Instead what we get is fake emotional uplift and everything's okay after all bunk.<br/><br/>Sadly this is the way modern movies are going - nothing to challenge your views, nothing to really make you think.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Boring. Amazing amounts of money spent to make this movie. Even more amazing amounts of money spent to see it. For the vast fortune spent on C.G.I. nothing shown is real. It's all fake cartoon visuals meant to distract the viewer from the lack of original plot. Twenty five minutes of viewing is all that is required to know the movie's entire story arc. I know this movie isn't about being great, its meant to showcase the technology of film-watching and the justification to someday charge $20 for a movie ticket. I understand that in our sh*tty economy we will someday have to pay $20 for a movie ticket all I ask is for my money's worth.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I still remember when this movie came out, everyone was talking about it. It was one of the highest grossing films of all time. The graphics blew everyone's mind. Yeah, it just didn't really do anything for me. I agree, the graphics are stunning. If you want to get sucked into this world with the CGI and the animation of all the animals, go see this movie because you will be pleased. But the reason this didn't really work for me is the story. It's a story that's been seen a million times before. Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas did this story, and it was old back then. I know a lot of people really liked this movie for it's graphics, but personally I have to be engrossed in the story to be engrossed in the movie. I also think that the villains were weakly developed. They're just the generic bad buys. So personally I'm not a fan, but that doesn't mean you won't be.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">After going off the face of the earth for over twelve years, James Cameron, one of the great directors of our time, has risen from the ashes victoriously. <br/><br/>The CGI is magnificent, and is no doubt the best I've ever seen since Peter Jackson blew the world's mind with his \"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\". The motion capture on the actors' bodies looks so real, that it took me to another dimension, almost another world. This grandeur was not only captured through the character animation, but also with the different CGI location shots of the different creatures, the forest, the trees, and the whole world he has created. This world reminded me very much of the 1992 release of \"Ferngully\", but in 3-D. Now regarding the plot, it is James Cameron simplicity-a paraplegic soldier (Sam Worthington) is given the opportunity to take in part of a mission on the planet Pandora. There, he learns that a greedy corporation intends to drive out the planet's inhabitants, the Na'vi, so to retrieve millions of dollars worth of minerals. In exchange for a spinal surgery that'll fix his legs, he gathers information for a military unit, led by a bloodthirsty Colonel (Stephen Lang) while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an \"avatar\" identity. As time passes and tension increases between the Na'vi and the humans, he is drawn between his orders and what he desires. <br/><br/>The plot sounds simple enough, yet I can't help but notice all of the undertones that James Cameron throws into his film. Without giving too much more of the story away, it made me think of how the U.S. government bullies people into what they want, particularly with the Iraq War, which is a fight over oil, at the cost of innocent Iraqi lives. I don't know if this was Cameron's intent, but this movie gives a pale reflection of our modern government and big corporations. <br/><br/>It also reflects on our issue with planet life. Cameron paints the marines as bloodthirsty villains who lust for destruction, but the Na'vi on the other hand, are deep lovers of nature and peace. This reminds me very much of the cowboy and Indian scenario depicted graphically in films such as \"Little Big Man\" and \"Dances with Wolves\", the white man's inability to make peace with both nature and different races. The Na'vi themselves remind me much of the Native Americans, despite the fact they're blue with pointy ears, and with golden eyes.<br/><br/>Overall, there is much to look forward to in \"Avatar\", and not just in the visual effects department. The actors all did a great job but I don't expect any of them to be nominated for an Oscar. On a personal note though, Stephen Lang as the gung-ho Colonel and Sigourney Weaver as the peace loving Scientist gave the best performances, and not because both are at the opposite ends of the spectrum, but with the fact they immersed themselves deeply into their characters so magically. <br/><br/>And for a 162-minute film, it flies by. There's no way you can be bored with this movie. James Cameron has once again made another excellent film that I'll declare as 2009's best film, and I'm considering in adding \"Avatar\" on my personal favorite list of movies. This movie has everything, effects (both visually and emotionally), believable characters, an interesting plot, and a fast pace. And trust me, at the end of the movie, you'll be cheering for the Na'vi.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I remember the day walking out of the cinema hall after watching \"The Abyss\", I was swept off my feet literally. For days I used to discuss about the Underwater Flying Objects &amp; CGI with my friends. The same happened after watching Terminator II. The rules were redefined and a new benchmark was set. When the VHS got out, I grabbed at the first available opportunity and must have watched the both innumerable times.<br/><br/>At the risk of being repetitive, \"Avataar\" was featured in Top-10 Unproduced scripts for about a decade. I had almost given up hope of being translated to screen. And with James Cameron enjoying his self- imposed exile, the wings of hopes barely twitched. So when \"Avataar\" was announced with James Cameron returning to his favourite terrain, the emotion was akin Archimedes \"Eureka!\". And topping up with 3D, it couldn't get any better. I waited for the release with bated breath.<br/><br/>So does he managed to pull off another spectacular feat yet again? The answer is a big YES! The creation and depiction of the Pandora is the key differentiator. It is a visual delight, literally feast for eyes. You would get engrossed, fall in love with it to the extent that you don't want to return to reality. <br/><br/>The social message about the environment which James Cameron has touch- based at a superficial level in \"The Abyss\" takes precedence in \"Avataar\" and perhaps it is the right time to address the subject. The way the message is conveyed is quite subtle and surreal. The ending got a bit over-the-top on the melodrama though.<br/><br/>When will be the next time James Cameron will WOW us again. That will be a million dollar question! Until then we should be eternal grateful to him for setting the bar at a new high. <br/><br/>PS: Be rest assured when the DVD is released, it going to be another record breaking event.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">There's a lot of clumsy plot details, and it's hard to get over how stupid some of these people look. If it was one hour shorter, it would get a 5 from me, I don't get why people like this film so much, this one was just meh, it was beautiful to look at but the story was pretty ill-conceived, and I don't think they accomplished what they were trying to do. And it was super bloated, it could shave off an easy 60 minutes, while not everything about this movie is bad, it's definitely a weaker endeavor, and it doesn't help that James Cameron is super petty and rereleased it in China so it would make more money, it's 12 years old. But at least I don't have to watch it again</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Having missed out on the event that was the Avatar cinema release in 3D, I finally got round to watching the 2D version on DVD. Whatever this event carried on the big screen, it is distinctly underwhelming viewed on DVD in your own living-room.<br/><br/>The story is Dances with Wolves and a hundred other culture clash templates. The characters are two dimensional and lack complexity. Sigourney Weaver as the scientist was the best hope for this, but she seems naively unaware of the military-industrial complex surroundings that pay the bills. While the storyline and characterizations are disappointing, Weaver's scientist clamouring for a cigarette and smoking in labs was both sickening and outlandish. Could Cameron really not finance this without pandering to the evils of Big Tobacco? Nice special effects but hardly spectacular. After that, there is not a lot to say about this film really. Ideas-wise, it is smarter than Transformers but more lightweight than Jurassic Park. Even Titanic provoked more thought. As an event, it will be discussed endlessly, but as a film, it inspires very little.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Twelve years in the making does \"Avatar\" justify its long production time? No, but it isn't a catastrophe, either, which if you look at the pressure James Cameron must have been under, is a little wonder. Of course, \"Avatar\" is still a little disappointing. With its three hours running time, its usage of extra special super-wow 3D-effects, and a director who's out to prove himself, one would have hoped for nothing less than a masterpiece. That it is not.<br/><br/>However, \"Avatar\" is an original and unique Sci-Fi/Fantasy-flick. Cameron and his crew have thought up a creative universe of colorful plants, imaginative animals and a whole alien nation. The story itself is pretty standard and kind of predictable, but still interesting enough for you to stay with it until the very end.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" still doesn't come close to Cameron's best works such as \"Terminator 1 &amp; 2\", \"Aliens\", and yes, even \"Titanic\" and the much more entertaining \"True Lies\". This movie compares best to \"The Abyss\": It's got great special effects, epic design... but the basic premise just isn't that interesting - and no CGI can change that, no matter how impressive and supposedly revolutionary it is.<br/><br/>What's to be expected, is that after this movie's huge success, Cameron will turn it into a trilogy and blow everything out of proportion (\"The Matrix\", anyone?). If that happens the \"Avatar\" moniker will become annoying pretty soon. As it is, it's a solid movie, but to us fans of \"Terminator\" and \"Aliens\", Cameron still has to prove that he \"hasn't lost it\", yet.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar keeps you waiting for marvelous images to emerge from the screen. That's the main reason why this ultra-linear/flat 2h40 story would make an interesting show. Every spectator wants to be surprised, so the National Geographic/Pandora Discovery Channel first part is enough to make us wait and watch through child's eyes.<br/><br/>Then the story is mainly against militarism, imperialism and about people living in harmony with their likes and the Nature. So it's not the usual heavy-handed big brawn and dull apocalyptic show of über-blockbusters. Nevertheless go find one interesting character in Avatar. To me, Neytiri is the most interesting, yet she's only the CGI rendition of a real actress (Zoe Saldana)! On the other hand Sam Worthington's avatar looks bland. In fact the whole main character is bland, passive and one-dimensional. Funnily enough Sam Worthington's character in Terminator: Salvation, very close to Jake Sully in terms of storyline, is a much deeper character...<br/><br/>Thus there are reasons to be disappointed by Avatar if you were expecting a groundbreaking masterpiece. Seeing it in 3D is an important experience for whoever is interested in movies and new technologies; the experience ranges from nice to very nice provided you can appreciate all the good work and stop short of being addicted to the images.<br/><br/>Simply put you can't fall for Avatar because its storyline is just too linear and its characters also just too one-dimensional. It took 12 years for James Cameron to be able to make Avatar and he wasn't able to write something better? More accurately, since he is not renown for his perfectly and subtly crafted screenplays I'd say he missed the opportunity to team up with some good writer(s). Cameron has reached such a status it's difficult for him to collaborate in a creative department he thinks he masters and thus the real joy for him must have been the creative collaboration on the technically challenging parts. As a result he put more energy in the visual creation of Avatar, not in the writing. Another very weak point is the score by James Horner: 12 years after Titanic he couldn't come up with something better that doesn't constantly brings memory of his previous score for Cameron. I suppose this shows just how much James Cameron was unable to provide the necessary amount of energy to the creative departments other than visual imagery.<br/><br/>Now, about the visual imagery, it's nice but only a rehash of Miyazaki's visual and poetic creations: Princess Mononoke (mainly), Nausicaä, Castle in the sky. Cameron didn't improve at all on these references.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I'll not go and watch Avatar again. There's nothing interesting beyond the 3D experience so I suspect it must be far less interesting, even boring, to watch in 2D.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">'Avatar' is a very good movie that sadly falls short of greatness. Cameron does what he has always done best and his shortcomings are in his weak area, script and plot development. Everything about 'Avatar' is perfect except for the script which is devastatingly mediocre.<br/><br/>First and foremost 'Avatar' is an event to be seen in 3-D. I can't imagine seeing it any other way. If you are considering seeing 'Avatar' you really have to get out and see it in 3-D. I can't imagine any DVD version of the film doing it justice. Cameron has created by far the most visually spectacular film of all time. 'Avatar' is beautiful to look at. Cameron's special effects have already surpassed anything Hollywood had ever done or dreamed of. 'Avatar' is a beautiful film to look at. It's lush colors, and galaxy are amazing. 3-D has been called a gimmick, and rightly so. A lot of films don't know how to use 3-D properly. I don't think 'Avatar' is as good if it isn't in 3-D. To see 'Avatar' is to have a sensory experience. I'd like to see it muted just so I can take in all the sights. George Lucas has been dethroned as Special Effects God.<br/><br/>As for the cast. I really don't think Cameron has had a better one in all his career. Stephen Lang and Sigoreney Weaver both deliver performances which I think could warrant Oscar consideration come Feburary. There hasn't been finer blue screen acting ever. These characters are embedded in the universe organically. We could see the awkwardness is just about every one of the Star Wars prequels and some moments in just about every Hollywood blockbuster since then like Iron Man at times. To act with extensive technology is hard. 'Avatar' doesn't have the problem in the least bit.<br/><br/>'Avatar' is a near masterpiece. There are times I kind of wish I had muted it though just to take it in viscerally. The problem with the picture is it's script and story structure. 'Avatar' has been done before many times before but with different names. I ask you how are Cameron's Na'vi fighting for Pandora any different from the Ewoks fighting to save Endor? How is Sam Worthington's Jake Sully different from Kevin Costner's John Dunbar? This story arch has been done to near exhaustion and it's been done better than it has been done here. Half way through the film I've heard people shout tree hugger at the film and laugh at some of Neytiri's lines. Cameron's mythology and story are no different than anything you'd find in Eastern Philosophy and Mythology for Dummies. The story isn't bad per say but it's cliché to the point where I knew what the ending would be an hour before it happened. The fact is this is a classic archetype and classic mythology, I'm not criticizing Cameron for using it. What I am criticizing him for is the fact that 'Avatar's story and mythology isn't unique enough to take me with it. He doesn't make anything his own. James Cameron has written his most disappointing script for his most beautiful movie</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Cameron makes another dent in film-making with an experience best viewed in IMAX 3D. But even then, this self-indulgent, overlong, technologically impressive\n",
       "  yet coy\n",
       "  film gets boring really quick. The groundbreaking special-effects amazes at first, but it doesn't keep you interested like the SFX did in \"T2\". \"T2\" had characters you loved or loved to hate; \"Avatar\" has characters that well\n",
       "  you're indifferent to their fate. A good film should include talented acting and a solid story. This film has neither. And Cameron knows it. And he tries to disguise it with jaw-dropping special-effects, which ultimately is just nothing more than an insult to the audience's intelligence and time. The only character you can have any feeling towards is hatred for an arrogant and stereotypical colonel, played by Stephen Lang who can't even deliver a believable performance.<br/><br/>** (out of four)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'll say this for James Cameron: he always entertains, good and bad.<br/><br/>First up, if there was an Academy Award for Best Imagination, Cameron would get the nod for Avatar, in my opinion. This production takes Cameron's visionary approach to story-telling to a new level and has indeed set a new benchmark in film art. When viewed in 3D at the cinema, this experience will leave all but the jaded in a state of awe, almost, with the most thrilling mix of fantastic creatures and battle scenes that may not be equaled for a long, long time.<br/><br/>However...don't pay too much attention to this story. Because it's been told too many times before, in different ways. Think of Dances with Wolves (1990); recall Broken Arrow (1950); remember The New World (2005); consider Apocalypse Now (1979); or, even On the Waterfront (1954) – in each of which, the protagonist hero turns his back on his own kind to fight on the side of the 'alien' or 'hostile' gang or horde. The fact that Cameron's setting is hundreds of years in the future is neither here nor there: thematically, it's the same story.<br/><br/>The most imaginative feature for me is the application of the Gaia principle – the entire moon of Pandora is an interconnected living thing – to assist the Na'vi in defeating the hated invaders i.e. us. And it's no accident the moon is called Pandora: if you recall your Greek mythology, you'll know what happens to those who open Pandora's box: full of horrible nasties ready to kill you. And, oh yeah, this movie also rehashes the timeless Pocahontas theme.<br/><br/>So, the real power in Cameron's story is entirely allegorical: in the same way that we humans are slowly poisoning and destroying the Earth around us, so also the invading army on Pandora – the mythical moon to a much larger planet – is intent upon pillaging or destroying whatever necessary to gain 'unobtainium', that rarest and most expensive of rare metals. On that point, you have to admire Cameron's chutzpah in using that name - almost the best joke in the story.<br/><br/>The best, however, comes at the end – naturally – when the Na'vi indigenes corral all the Earthly mercenaries to ship them back to their own dying planet: a nice self-referential twist on Pogo's sentiment that 'We have met the enemy and he is us.'<br/><br/>The cast and script are up to the job, but nothing to garner awards. Those will come, deservedly I think, for a host of technical aspects – cinematography, editing, sound, special effects etc – that make this film unique. And maybe even for best director. Some lines and scenes bear striking resemblance to aspects of prior Cameron movies; but, I guess it's okay to rehash bits of your own stuff.<br/><br/>Anyway, go and see it on the big screen – you'll be sorry if you wait for DVD. I broke my fifteen year hiatus from actual cinema-going just to experience this one as it should be. You might even go twice, as I did...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I wont go in the debate about the plot of this movie, nor do I want to blame Cameron from possible idea thefts, as Avatar really is a story, that has been done tens of times since there has been written stories.<br/><br/>The simplistic story is well played, but for such a long movie the characters stay mostly in the level of caricatures, which is a shame, as now good actors like Sigorney Weaver and Stephen Lang are left almost unused background material. Lang especially is such an one dimensional character, that there's no doubt left of his evil nature. There's no gray areas in between, he's just evil.<br/><br/>What I want to say though is, that the movie looks great. Even the Na'vi, which design I'm not that keen about looked mostly very convincing. But because they used so much time in creating the fauna of Pandora I felt that from times I was watching a nature documentary instead of a sci-fi/fantasy flick.<br/><br/>All said, Avatar is not a terrible way to spend a couple of hours. It looks good and moves along pretty well, despite it feels a bit too chopped from here and there.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Alright. So I was wrong. Let's just get it all out in the open right away. For six months I've been bagging and busting the chopping of Avatar. Well, last night I saw it the way it was meant to be seen – in IMAX 3D. Was it good? Yes. I wish I could say that this has taught me a lesson – don't bag on movies before you see them – but I'd be lying if I said I'll never do it again. It's the human nature of anyone who is into movies and I'm sure that I'll fall victim to my own idiocy again more sooner than later. Alright, let's move on to the review.<br/><br/>Avatar really does look great. The landscape of the planet Pandora is very rich in detail and you can tell that James Cameron spent hundreds or thousands of hours going over every aspect of its design. If you have a good level of suspension of disbelief, you can literally get lost in this film and feel like you're there. You can definitely still tell the Na'vi are CGI when you see full body shots of them, but amazingly close-ups of their feet and hands look almost frighteningly real. The other thing that was kind of creepy was how real the close-up head shots looked and how from different angles, you could see the actors' actual features in their avatar's face. It really was amazingly well-done. My only other complaint is that some of the animals still had a shiny CGI look to them that distracted you from fully being immersed. The mix of actual real actors, machinery, and CGI came off without a hitch.<br/><br/>The acting started out a bit forced, which I believe had something to do with the dialogue possibly. Even veteran actor Sigourney Weaver was having trouble pulling off the lines. It almost seemed like they started to settle into their roles, which is pretty much impossible since the film I'm sure was shot out of sequence. Sam Worthington did a great job in his role as Marine Jake Sully. Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch was a bit over the top and times, but still quite a bit of fun. Michelle Rodriguez was basically just your typical Michelle Rodriguez tough-girl. I'm not a tech head, so I don't know how much of the actual actor you see on screen, but Zoe Saldana did a great job making the different emotions of her Na'vi character, Neytiri, quite believable.<br/><br/>Now, let's move on to the story. It's pretty much recycled from any other number of films like Braveheart or even The Alamo. You know – the small guys fight against the odds and in the end win because of their big hearts and belief in their cause. It gets to be a bit overwhelming and heavy-handed because you've got that aspect (which obviously is meant to be a mirror image of the uprooting and treatment of the Native Americans) mixed with an environmental message, and then Cameron even throws in some New Age Mother Earth mumbo-jumbo to further push his obvious agenda. It all gets to be a bit overbearing. Apparently, Cameron felt that this was his platform to let us all know his world view on politics, the environmental plight, and spirituality. Which is fine, since he spent some twelve years on this thing and it's obviously his big baby of a movie? The 3D filming was very well-done. It wasn't too in-your-face and was used quite well to accent and give depth to the scenes for the most part. There were some parts that were a bit hard to focus on and seemed a bit cluttered, like some of the chase scenes and such. I have to say that if you don't see this in 3D, you're pretty much wasting your time. It's most definitely not going to have the same effect in 2D and is going to lose quite a bit.<br/><br/>Overall, I have to say that I'm glad I gave the movie a chance and went to see it. I was originally so stupidly against it after I was disappointed in the Avatar Day footage that I wasn't even going to see it in the theater. That would have been a mistake. It's a fun and entertaining film. It gets a bit intense and dark at times with the destruction of the Na'vi's home. Just be prepared to be force fed James Cameron's beliefs while you're enjoying the visual eye candy and munching your popcorn. You're going to hear what he has to say, whether you like it or not.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the future, a wheelchair bound marine named Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) reveals how his brother, who was a scientist, was killed. It is because of this death and the fact that they share the same DNA that Jake is asked by his military employers to operate his brother's avatar, a virtual body that is controlled by a person's mind. Jake is sent by a group of scientists, including the reluctant Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), to investigate the island of Pandora, which holds valuable minerals that need to be researched. Yet in regaining the use of his legs through the alien-like body of the avatar, Jake is careless and becomes separated from the rest of the science team. Stranded, he is rescued from wild monsters by a native girl, Neytiri (voiced by Zoe Saldana), who resembles the same avatar employed by Jake and the scientists. Hesitantly, she introduces Jake's avatar to the rest of her tribe. They are initially hostile to Jake's avatar but he convinces them not to kill him, and he comes to understand their customs more thoroughly.<br/><br/>Director James Cameron has always been a filmmaker interested in spectacle. His most famous feature film Titanic, was made over a decade ago and was praised more for its technical accomplishments, rather than its scripting accomplishments. Avatar, which has accumulated significant levels of hype over its lengthy production, because of its apparent specialisation in 3D technology, is likely to follow suit. As with Titanic, this is a visually magnificent production, with a budget soaring into hundreds of millions. The 3D visuals as a whole are outstanding. The rich variety of locations, from cliff faces to thick green forests, mountain ranges and military bases, are lavishly beautiful and command to be seen on the silver screen. The lighting, in particular a forest lit with neon lights, is simply beautiful, as too is the smooth animation of the avatars themselves. Cameron's strength as a director has always lain with visuals effects and the technology. It is a quality he demonstrates most thoroughly with this film. However, despite the spectacle, some might be disappointed with the 3D technology itself. Unlike other pictures such as A Christmas Carol, Avatar opts for more subtle refinements to the visuals, like occasional glimpses of added depth to the picture, rather than launching objects and gesture towards the audience. Avatar is slightly more immediate and sharper than a standard 2D picture, but its 3D technology might not be quite as obvious and satisfying as some might have been expecting.<br/><br/>For all of its aesthetic qualities, Avatar is highly marred by a script that is highly formulaic, recycled and severely lacking in intellect or depth. This is yet another big budget action film with a narrative devoid of interesting or sympathetic characters. Sam Worthington has a fairly unremarkable and unchallenging role as Jake, who simply doesn't have enough to do in the film. He is completely outdone by the avatar that he voices, who features in all the action scenes. Michelle Rodriguez has again found herself cast as the typical hardened girl, while Giovanni Ribisi and Stephen Lang both have painfully obvious roles as the films typical baddies. At least Zoe Saldana has some emotion in voicing Neytiri but these are not so much fully fleshed out characters as caricatures and archetypes that only develop in the most formulaic way. The film's dialogue, written by Cameron, ranges from merely serviceable to outright poor and no matter how much the sweeping music score would like to arouse emotion in the audience, it is difficult to care about these characters. More frustrating is how rapidly the film becomes predictable because of the number of elements recycled from other films. Once Jake is taken in by the natives it is highly obvious as to what will happen and who he will rally against. Slow motion jumps for cover, exploding spaceships, last second death requests and a forbidden romance, are just some of the clichés that are used throughout a very insubstantial script. Any ethics or moral ambiguities that could have been derived from the obvious allusions to Native Americans and Colonialism are diminished because of the cartoon division between purely good and simply evil. Given that it has been over a decade since Cameron's last big budget feature film, a lot more was expected from the narrative and the array of talent here deserved far better.<br/><br/>In spite of its failings, Avatar will attract and impress computer game enthusiasts who will see the film purely for its outstanding visuals and the action which unravels on the grandest scale. For those that are expecting something far more intelligent and substantial, this will seem like a formulaic and predictable action movie, given the various problems with the script, the over length and the largely wasted cast. The 3D visuals and cinematic quality alone are not enough to justify the hefty price of admission expected by cinemas these days.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Back in 1997, visionary director James Cameron came out with the romantic drama Titanic, which won best picture of the year and became the biggest film of all time. 12 years later, Cameron comes back with Avatar, which is now the biggest film of all time.<br/><br/>I truly wish that The Dark knight, which is on the top 3, was the biggest movie of all time. But I can accept the fact that Avatar is. Avatar is gorgeous. You'll never see anything like it. It's truly a beautiful film.<br/><br/>When you watch this film, you are not expecting great acting. You are expecting awesome action sequences and special effects and not that good of a story plot. Well ,actually, the story plot is good. It's like Pocohontas but with blue alien like people. There are awesome action sequences and special effects. And the acting isn't bad. <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is actually quite humorous as the expert on the Avatar program. Stephen Lang does a really good job of getting on your nerves. Zoe Saldana does some ballsy acting and some talented acting too as an alien, and to some surprise I actually liked Sam Worthington. I originally thought that they were trying to turn him into the next Russell Crowe. Now I kind of understand why they are casting him. Though he's not a great actor, he isn't that bad.<br/><br/>Worthington plays Dr. Jake Sully, a wheelchaired man who is sent to do The Avatar program because he has the same DNA as his late brother. He goes into his Avatar and he meets a female alien(played by Zoe Saldana). She introduces him to her tribe and she begins to train him and they eventually fall for each other. All is well until the group Sully is with tries to destroy Pandora, which is what I forget to mention, is a beautiful jungle where the aliens live.<br/><br/>James Cameron is a film director that will spend billions and billions of dollars wisely. He has done it many times and has never failed. Some film directors will blow there money away(Michael Bay for Transformers 2). Some deserve to use it(Christopher Nolan).<br/><br/>Avatar is a fantastic motion picture event. It is perfect. The visuals are gorgeous, the film is kind of deep, the acting isn't bad, and just everything about it. The film is sad also. It did deserve to be nominated for best picture, though it wasn't my favorite film of the year. Avatar is a film that you can't miss out on. It's long, but so was Titanic. That was a great film ,and so is this.<br/><br/>Avatar:A+</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">AVATAR seems like a good film for a thirteen-year-old boy on LSD. In fact, it still might be too tedious. Wow, this was mindbogglingly tedious. It was SOOOOOO tedious that it was torture sitting through the first 1hr42 minutes so as to leave only one more hour of tedium for the second night, during which I had to take breaks every fifteen minutes just to survive. Did people actually sit in their seats in theaters for 2hr42min? I find that nearly impossible to believe.<br/><br/>And yet, it appears, people actually liked this! Who are the people who laud this film? (Do I know any of them?) This was so ridiculously lame, from the plagiarized plot(-not!) to the trite dialogue and rampant clichés, from the sappy sentimentalism to the hypocritical moral condescension and truly embarrassing attempt to educate the ignorant masses about the history of the American Indians and all of the other people victimized by the U.S. military. As a matter of fact, I am a lefty with strong anti-war, anti-military leanings who is appalled by the history of what my own government has done with my hard-earned federal tax dollars even within my lifetime, to say nothing of what went on before. But even I could not stomach this thinly veiled, heavy-handed moralistic critique aimed at--who, precisely? Honestly, what a pile of pablum!<br/><br/>As though the lack of any shred--or even the thinnest thread--of originality in the \"plot\" (apparently \"penned\"--er--plagiarized by Cameron in three weeks, which as a matter of fact seems awfully long, given the condition of the final product) were not fatal enough, the women of the victimized native tribe all happen to look like a cross between Cher Bono and Paris Hilton, and they all have yellow teeth and wear green cabochon chokers and hiss like cats! Oh, and they also do yoga and listen to new age music. I kid you not!!!<br/><br/>But I cannot waste another precious minute of my life on this piece of tripe. Suffice it instead to say that AVATAR is SOOOOO bad that if it was a blockbuster and people are truly vaunting it as a masterpiece, well, I can only say that this does not bode well for the future of Western civilization.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Do you remember the first time you saw the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park? The day you watched Gollum interacting with Frodo and Sam in The Two Towers? Or even the day you first saw Star Wars? That sense of wonder, that sense of excitement, that emotional connection to something you witness on screen that was created in an effects warehouse and does not exist in the real world. That is how I hoped I would feel when I watched Avatar, James Cameron's first film since his mighty Titanic set sail back in 1997.<br/><br/>Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic marine sent to the distant planet Pandora to take part in a program where humans are being hardwired into the genetically grown bodies of the native population called the Na'vi. The mission is to become part of a clan, and learn more about the Na'vi people's culture. But not everything always goes to plan.<br/><br/>Simply put, Avatar is an astonishing piece of film-making in all senses of the word. I had doubts that Cameron could top himself after breaking huge ground in the film-making medium with the likes of Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic, but those twelve years of documentary film-making and preparation (and maybe even helping create Aquaman) seems to have helped launch Avatar into the stratosphere. The film is difficult to describe, but it really is something to be marvelled at.<br/><br/>The special effects that drive Avatar are some of the most advanced we have ever seen in a film. WETA has created a living, breathing world filled with a plethora of highly imaginative creatures, weapons and vehicles. Even the most sinister of beasts looks richly detailed, and awe-inspiring. There is just too much work that has been done on these creations that it is painful to even fathom how many hours it took to design everything that populates Pandora. Even the set designs and backgrounds, whether it be in the wild nature of the planet or in the militarized bases smack in the middle of it, are fully realized creations. There is no stone left unturned here, no half-assed effects in certain areas (which is more than can be said for the disgustingly effects-heavy Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen); everything has the same amount of shine and polish added to it. The added gloss of 3D effects only help to further bring these effects to life, and seeing the film in a 2D setting would just be a disservice to the crew who put in all the effort to create them.<br/><br/>When we reflect years from now on the film, the Na'vi people themselves are undoubtedly what we will continue to discuss. These giant, slim, blue skinned humanoid creatures are sensational creations. I wanted to believe at any given moment that they were real, because they looked and sounded that good. Better yet, Cameron managed to ensure they had their own language and their own culture as well. If they were not real, then the man has gone to great lengths to ensure they are the next best thing to it. There is so much going on at any time with them that I am speechless even attempting to decipher what to say next. If the film does not revolutionize film-making as people have said it in the months leading up to its release, these special effects wonders will.<br/><br/>The acting is extraordinary across the board, whether it be someone acting as a human or as a Na'vi. Worthington continues from his film-stealing role in Terminator Salvation with another fantastic performance here. He is just so charismatic, so emotional and so real that even with his relative inexperience, he leads the film like no one else could. Zoe Saldana does a great job as Neytiri, Jake's connection within the Na'vi people, as does Michelle Rodriguez as the fighter pilot Trudy. Joel David Moore and Giovanni Ribisi also put in some great work in supporting roles. Although I was not expecting much from her, I was really impressed by Sigourney Weaver, who has a much more significant role in the film than the trailer may suggest. But the only one who even remotely comes close to the greatness of Worthington is Stephen Lang as the villainous Colonel Miles Quaritch. He gladly joins into a club of fantastically written and even better acted bad ass Cameron-film villains. At times, he is just downright terrifying to watch as he works his magic on screen.<br/><br/>If there is anything wrong with the film besides its nearly obscene running time (which is not as bad as it could have been), it is that it plays out slightly predictable. It is not as by-the-numbers as movies like Clint Eastwood's Invictus is, but it does not take a lot of sharp turns after the plot makes itself known. If you know anything about it at all, you probably have a fair idea of what is coming once the film starts. I appreciate that the film does have a few surprises (and its share of hokey dialogue), but there were a few areas where I wish I did not already have a solid right guess as to what was coming next.<br/><br/>Despite issues with the script, Avatar still manages to be the single most ambitiously conceived film-making project of the decade, and the rare film that is every bit worthy of its hype. It is the type of film where you need to look past its issues, and look at the worthwhile endeavour Cameron has helped give us for what it is – a truly unique science fiction that is unlike what we have ever seen before, and will not be easily recreated. The film practically begs to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>Welcome back Mr. Cameron. Hail to the king.<br/><br/>8.5/10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I strangely have not reviewed it until now. Largely due to the fact that I was awaiting the fully extended edition. It really allows you to fully immerse yourself in the world of Pandora, and the character of Sam Worthington as well. The screenplay is obviously an re-used one that people are more than familiar with, alas \"Dances With Wolves\" or Disney's \"Pocahontas\", etc, etc. For that, I cannot say it surpassed \"T2\" or \"Aliens\". This film plays on our emotions just in the way Kevin Costner and that fictional Disney romance did, just on a more elaborate scale drenched in sci-fi to disguise it. While pretty damn obvious, and so for that I can not award this film ten stars, it is pretty entertaining.<br/><br/>The alien world is well put together with dazzling sights. The environments are astonishingly real and the way it was masterfully shot made you feel as though you were there amidst the terrifying yet intriguing fictional world. Each bizarre animal is incredibly vivid and it is rare to find creatures in a film that are so amazing. The cast was incredible and were built up quite nicely. Zoe Saldana was great, and you know I loved Sigourney Weaver throughout. Michelle Rodriguez was pretty good herself but the performance I adored the most was Stephen Lang's. He was brutal and the best shot in the whole film had to be that epic jump out of the exploding air-battle ship. What a bad-ass!! I don't know if it's just me but I do know I'm the type of viewer who connects with antagonist so for me it was kind of sad to watch him die. The score was rather good, by the master James Horner, but I found it lacking here and there. That main theme you hear as their precious tree burns is okay, but it's not quite the saddest theme I've ever heard. From time to time, it borrows a bit from \"Aliens\" as well, but overall it hold together.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a must see, and try to see the complete extended cut which has almost 20 minutes of extra footage.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">From the reviews I read, I expected Avatar to be sleepy, something like watching beautiful sea dragons courting, but it is a typical Star Wars shoot 'em up, a somewhat tedious shoot 'em up. The villains are military, corporate bigots. There are references to the Viet Nam, the Afghan and Iraq wars, and the genocides of the first nations people. It is also about the way these villains take a satanic joy in destroying the natural world. <br/><br/>I suspect most of the people who panned the movie for lack of plot were Republicans irritated at seeing all their oxen gored.<br/><br/>The movie is a metaphor for the uncaring violence of the military, the rampant greed of the corporation and the mindless prejudice of the xenophobe. Oddly, the hero, who infiltrates the off worlders in a surrogate body (avatar), is a marine, doltish but handsome as the stereotypical marine. In the end he leads a romantic, violent, Custer's last stand revolt against the powers of evil. <br/><br/>Despite the fact much of the movie is battle scenes, there is little gore. The most shocking scene was a bleeding 6-legged horse.<br/><br/>The animation is so well done, often I figured it must be characters in makeup. There is all kinds of subtlety in the fine movement of face muscles. The extreme faces of the off worlders are fascinating to watch. You don't think of it as animation. It is just a unfamiliar world where you have no reference points on how things should look. <br/><br/>The thing I most enjoyed about the movie was the imagination that went into creating the off-world fantastic plants and animals, that were often impossible, but there you saw them clearly \"real\". The detail was so exquisite it compelled me to believe in their existence even though my science background was screaming TILT. <br/><br/>The joke of the movie is that technology allowed human actors to inhabit alien bodies, both in the process of making the movie, and inside the movie itself, though the technology was quite different. <br/><br/>The thing that bothered me most was how preposterously overpopulated the Pandora forest was. It looked like downtown Tokyo. Someone got carried away with the AI clone tool.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I first heard about James Cameron's \"Avatar\" about three years ago on IMDb, and have been waiting eagerly for it ever since. And now that it's here, I can say that it is definitely worth the wait. \"Avatar\" is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is contacted by the US government to help on a mission: On a new planet called Pandora, some very valuable mineral ore has been discovered, but unfortunately, the largest supply is under a tree where an indigenous people, the Na'vi, live. The government, led by Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi, in full-on big biz asshole mode), wants them to relocate, and to that end, they have enlisted the military to help, led by Col. Quaritch (a chillingly evil Stephen Lang). A scientist, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), is researching the planet and teaching the natives in order to find a more diplomatic solution. To do this, she has created avatars, which are Na'vi which humans, like Sully, can control through a machine. But when Sully becomes accepted by the Na'vi, he finds his loyalties tested.<br/><br/>This isn't an actors movie, but the performances work. Sam Worthington is effective in a low-key performance, but he's capable of more volatile acting when the situation calls for it. Zoe Saldana is very good in the role of his teacher/love interest. Giovanni Ribisi is terrific as the money-loving jerk, calling to mind his villainous performance in \"Flight of the Phoenix\" remake, but he's not creepy here, just a jerk. After seeing him in a few previous performances and in the trailer, I had my doubts about Stephen Lang. I was proved wrong though, Quaritch is a nasty piece of work, and a terrific villain. Sigourney Weaver is good as the somewhat bitchy scientist, but she's still sympathetic.<br/><br/>This is James Cameron's show, however. The story may be familiar, but a story is only as good as how well it's told. And \"Avatar\" is told brilliantly. Cameron has patience; he knows that the audience is going to be so enamored with visuals that it will be hard for them to concentrate on the story. Cameron allows time for the audience to get used to the visuals before the story really begins, thus two parts of our brain are not battling for control (although the visuals never cease to amaze).<br/><br/>The best thing about \"Avatar\" is the sense of excitement. Even the most involving action movies don't get the sense of excitement going, at least not to this level. This is an immensely fun and exciting movie, and a must-see.<br/><br/>This is an incredible film; I can't stress that enough. And I can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>Note: I didn't really notice the 3D, but maybe it was because I was sitting kind of far back. Oh well, it's worth it either way.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">There are films, and then there are movies. I am not going to be technical here in my definitions, I'm just going to speak from how I feel the difference is between the two words. A film is a piece of work that might be artistically engaging, but is just meh, whereas a movie is all that and a bag of chips. A movie is something that sweeps you away into its world and keeps you riveted to your seat till the credits roll. James Cameron's Avatar is a movie in the best sense of the word.<br/><br/>Avatar has been in production for nearly fourteen years, and it shows in the world in which James Cameron has created. The world is Pandora, an alien moon covered in lush rainforests inhabited by wild alien creatures of astounding design, and an indigenous race of 10 ft. tall cat people called the Nav'i, who have had their own language created specifically for this movie. Humans have come to Pandora to mine a precious resource that is unique to the planet, but in order to do so they must relocate the Nav'i, which is almost impossible, so the humans have instituted the avatar program. The avatar program is where human scientists mix the DNA of a human with that of a Nav'i in a test tube, resulting in an organically grown humanoid that a human can link their mind into Matrix-style. All of this is unfurled upon the audience within the first thirty minutes or so, and while it all seems a touch too explanatory, it is necessary information needed for the rest of the movie to work.<br/><br/>The hero of this story is Jake Sully (likably played by Aussie, Sam Worthington), a paraplegic ex-marine who comes to Pandora after his identical twin brother's death to fill his brother's slot in the avatar program. While in his avatar, Jake can run and walk unlike he can as a human. Eventually Jake meets Neytiri, a Nav'i princess (portrayed by Zoe Saldana, who completely disappears into the role). Jake and Neytiri fall in love and Jake begins to embark upon an ordeal to get inducted into Nav'i civilization. All the while, the war-mongering human corporation behind the whole shindig is chomping at the bit to eradicate the Nav'i from the face of the planet in order to mine. This conflict results in Jake having to choose sides between the humans he hails from, and his newfound home with the Nav'i.<br/><br/>The story has traces of so many different movies found within. It's ecological message can make you want to compare it to the work of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, where as it's sci-fi/fantasy story of a man crossing over to fight for an alien race can make one think of The Planet of the Apes, not to mention the influences found from our own country's Native American history. Of course, to me Avatar is a wholly original experience. James Cameron should be applauded for attempting something that isn't based upon a book, comic book, or video game. In a way, Avatar is far more thought out and better executed than many movies that are already part of pre-existing properties. What Cameron did here was tell a story that blurs the lines between science fiction and fantasy, much in the way that he blurs the realities between Jake's two worlds.<br/><br/>Avatar is many different things, it has romance, action, adventure, and drama. The film has moments of sheer wonderment, and moments that make your heart ache or wanna punch the bad-guy Col. Quaritch, played to perfection by Stephen Lang. That is why Avatar is such a good time at the cinema, because of these moments. Cameron actually took the time within the film to detail the world, to give you a sense of its scope and its scale, and it all adds up to make Avatar a rollicking success.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, Avatar is a special time at the cinema. It's one of those movies that has to be experienced again in order to fully drink it all in, but even after one viewing, the film is very much appreciated. Thanks, James Cameron.<br/><br/>I give Avatar a 10 out of 10!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">When movies are created, they are done so with intent. Different genres of film target specific audiences, a formula which has sustained Hollywood and it's industries since the beginning of the blockbuster movies. When a movie is created in a manner that sets in motion any given goal, said films success is pendant on whether or not that goal is reached. If a comedy creates laughter, or if a romance produces tears, then they are successes in their own right. So when a massively ambitious, seemingly impossible to create film aiming to usher in a new era manages to grab hold of it's audience and take them on an unprecedented cinematic roller coaster ride that delivers the goods every turn of the way, it can be considered successful. Avatar is that success.<br/><br/>A work in progress that spanned a decade and a half, Avatar is more than just a film - it's an experience, an event. When James Cameron set out to make this movie back in the mid 90's, he realized that his ambitions were simply too far ahead of their time. His ideas could not be reached in a feasible manner, and due to this, he had to wait. Or create. Once informed that the image he held for this film was one that was out of grasp, he began working on the technology that would bring his masterpiece within reach. Fifteen years and nearly half a billion dollars later, James Cameron has brought that vision to the screen, and has done so in an extravagant and showstopping way.<br/><br/>Avatar tells the tale of a war between species, each fighting for the ultimate survival of their race. Desperate to find the fuel for their dying planet, human soldiers and scientists set out from earth and set course for Pandora. A planet connected by all living things, Pandora is home to an indigenous species known as the Na'vi, as well as the precious element Unobtanium needed to save earth. Using transference technology, paralyzed marine Jake Sully is volunteered for the \"Avatar Program\", which enables the thoughts and mind of a human to be placed within the shell of a tube-born Na'vi body. Using this as technique to their advantage, Jake is sent into the harsh Jungles of Pandora in order to bond with the natives, thus gaining knowledge and insight on their ways. Having originally planned to use this knowledge as a means of negotiating the natives relocation, so that the humans can access the deposit of Unobtainium - which just happens to sit below their most worshiped and valued pseudo-deity of their planet.<br/><br/>While the plot on paper may read as a standard shoot'em-up action sci-fi flick, it is a near inconceivable task to truly explain how incorrect this appearance truly is. This takes a stroke from every movie, and a dab from every genre, and manages to create a portrait of beauty, in which all pre-existing notion of what cinema can and cannot do is destroyed. Within the lengthy hundred and sixty some odd minutes of film, moviegoers will find that there is always something to keep them enthralled, a merciful gift when considering how tedious many of the longer film of recent memory can become.<br/><br/>No matter what can be said about the overtly cheesy script,a criticism that, while holding true, manages to fit charmingly into the over-the-top nature of the film, Avatar does as it set out to do, bringing moviegoers a cinematic experience rather than a film. Relying on the technology that he created, Cameron pours his heart into this movie, and it shows in every scene. Ranging from the absurdly detailed creatures to all-too-realistic planet, this flick manages to tell a fulfilling story while all the while throwing jaw-dropping scenery at the audience, giving them only enough time to recover before bombarding them with yet another breathtaking shot.<br/><br/>Be it the fantastical and charming love story told between the native and the outsider, or the too-real-to-be-true action scenes between gunships and foreign ferals, Avatar is what Star Wars was too the 70's, the Wizard Of Oz of the 40's - a masterpiece that will go down in movie history as a game changer of it's time.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">A spellbinding animated adventure film with a simplistic script and predictable characters.<br/><br/>The creativity and imagination of the film is undeniable, and the fantastic world of Pandora is creative, beautiful and artistically created and colored regarding Nature and Creatures, myths and mood.<br/><br/>I must say that I found the animation, especially at first a little awkward, a sort of advanced video-game with improved facial and body movements. However, once you get into the story, and as the animated part gains prominence in the film, you stop seeing animation, and you see real characters and a real fantastic world. That is a credit to the director and creative team.<br/><br/>I also loved the idea of a harmonious natural world where everything is interconnected, where the energy is shared. A little primal and indigenous Eden that is going to be violated and abused by human beings who believe to be superior despite their greediness and lack of respect to the environment. It is a metaphor of the inconsistencies of the modern world that ignores the environment and other humans beings to spread a system that is self-destructive. The whole philosophy and spirituality of the natives is very zen, really wonderful, and very well explained and developed.<br/><br/>My biggest criticism of the film is the incongruity, so American, of defending the right to a peaceful and harmonious world through war. The fighting and war scenes are great, but, obviously, very violent, so that all the film's Peace message is betrayed very soon. The movie becomes a thriller, with good and bad characters, military leaders, defenders and attackers. My second criticism is that the story line and characters are predictable, which tones down the whole movie and makes it less interesting for the viewer who wants a little bit of depth and is not easily content with just wonderful visuals.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film, because it is, mostly, an action movie, with fantastic enthralling action and war scenes, and super-duper visuals. However, it has a mix of meditation, romance, adventure, sci-fi, and zen premises that will captivate men and women, children and adults.<br/><br/>A true blockbuster, and a landmark for movies to come regarding visuals and special effects.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron's Avatar shows a perfect example of what a awesome science fiction movie really is. Writer, editor, producer, and director James Cameron uses a good ensemble cast which includes Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Michelle Rodriguez, Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, and the legendary Sigourney Weaver. Avatar had all the perfect ingredients for a science fiction epic. The visual effects to this movie are stunning, the cinematography is magnificent. the art direction is fantastic, and even the action sequences are just awesome. Also even the acting is perfect for a science fiction film, Sam Worthington gives the best performance of his career in James Cameron's best film yet. For those of you movie lovers who love science movies and haven't seen this one yet i have nothing else to say but just watch it because for me it was a great movie watching experience.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I sometimes can't understand why so many thought Avatar was less than amazing. I do understand that people have differing views, but darn! Sure, the plot has some vague similarities to other movies, but how can anyone say they were \"stolen\" plots? Every \"great\" movie I ever saw had similarities in both emotional presentation and character development. Oh well, to each their own view...mine is that Avatar deserves nothing less than a 10, both in creativity and delivery.<br/><br/>i know I was mesmerized from the start, and quite frankly didn't realize that three hours had past. I can't wait for the promised sequel, thank you James!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'm not wont to assign a perfect score to a film, but this is one that deserves it. I've seen it four times now, and it remains a brilliant jewel of a movie. How often does a film reduce a cynical, angry adult man to a state of childlike wonder? There is nothing to criticize in this film. It is pure entertainment, a work of art. It is interesting, intelligent, fast-paced, action-filled, beautiful and enchanting. The story itself is simple: a soldier goes native and saves the locals and their world from destruction from his own kind. This story has been told before (surely); however, it has never been told like this. However, the crucial fact is that the story is set in Pandora, the ultimate alien jungle paradise. Yes, this movie is all about Pandora. Thís planet and its denizens the Na'vi are portrayed in the film with astonishing technical skill, more like technical artistry. On top of all this, the movie has a profound message about, well, mystical environmentalism. Is that completely cool or what? Really, this is perhaps the best film ever made. Cameron is a god.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I've got to admit that a film like \"Avatar\" is not the usual film I would go for. I'm not a big sci-fi nut and would only really watch a science fiction film if it was meant to be incredibly good. Don't get me wrong, I like \"District 9\" as much as the next person, but I would never watch a film like \"District 9\" if someone hadn't told me that it was incredible. A film about giant blue people riding around on deformed dinosaurs doesn't appeal to me. However, when my blonde friend mentioned that he had the DVD how could I not borrow it? This is the most expensive film ever made and the highest grossing. Also, there's someone constantly drooling over it, telling me how amazing it is. Well I had to put it to the test and my thoughts are that it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. But it wasn't as good as everyone was saying.<br/><br/>If Peter Jackson's \"King Kong\" had passionate intimate relations with Tim Burton's \"Alice In Wonderland\" then I would imagine that the offspring would look something like \"Avatar\". And there is certainly no denying at how incredible it looks! The film is a visual feast and would be the perfect film to own on Blu-ray because I don't think that DVD did enough justice to the incredible locations. There's such a great juxtaposition between the dull sciency place and the garish land of the giant blue people. The CGI animation is also almost flawless, although I would say no better than \"King Kong\" in some areas. The blue people for example didn't look that great compared to the incredible Kong and his dinosaur friends.<br/><br/>I think that the visuals were so sensational that people sort of became hypnotised and desensitised into thinking that \"Avatar\" is one of the most amazing films of all time. I watched it for the first time on DVD, which means that the screenplay also shows up as much as the special effects, and they certainly differ in quality. When we first enter the land of the blue people it plays out almost like a video game, with a big blue man patrolling the forest with a big gun and shooting weird enemies. The screenplay is incredibly dumb in other words. It's nothing we haven't seen before but because it's put into this garish fantasy world it appears almost brand new.<br/><br/>It's also really patronising with the \"save the planet\" theme being constantly jammed down our throats. The big blue people even use their hair to connect with the wildlife and be at one with them. They're no different from my hippy tree-hugging Aunty Susie. The love story is also really clichéd and sometimes feels forced. Some of the characters are two-dimensional and predictable as well with the evil Army man with his army of evil humans going to destroy the blue people's beautiful habitat to get the oil (I know it's not oil, but really it's no different to it). However, some characters are also quite likable like Sigourney Weaver's character who was really funny on occasions! The final half hour was actually really spectacular with incredible action gracing the screen. It suddenly became really fun, although predictable. It was so obvious from the fight that the paraplegic was going to have a massive battle with the evil army man. That part became predictable, but fun. This is what the end to Tim Burton's \"Alice In Wonderland\" should've been like! The directing was really impressive throughout as well, as it was full of energy and captured some truly fantastic cinematography. The use of sound was also very effective.<br/><br/>But in the end \"Avatar\" may look sensational and it does have a heart but it doesn't have a brain. \"Inception\" manages to balance incredible visuals with an incredible screenplay and succeeds. Maybe, if \"Avatar\" was able to do the same it would've been absolutely brilliant. But it didn't. Films like \"The Artist\" completely counter films like \"Avatar\" as it doesn't even bother to add any colour or sound, yet wins all the major awards and rightly so! \"Avatar\" is a loud, in-your-face and dumb sci-fi actioner that is brilliant to look at and it does get progressively more fun as it goes on, but lacks the writing skills. \"District 9\" deals with similar themes but in a much, much more effective way. Watch that instead.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">If this was the movie James Cameron has wanted to do since he was a teen, then maybe he should have taken better notes, or should have taken a very sharp editor's eye to his script.<br/><br/>Because while this film is indeed pretty and a spellbinding achievement in the most stunningly realistic CG of any movie today, the plot is almost insulting in how stale, cliché'd, and just plain boring, ordinary, and generic it is. There's no surprises to be had; you know exactly who's going to win and who's going to lose, you know exactly how different action (not just fight) sequences will turn out, you know exactly what characters will live and which will die, which ones will have an abrupt Heel-Face turn, and which ones will turn out to be good all along.<br/><br/>The only thing that will be memorable of this movie is its visual effects.<br/><br/>Right from the start, the film does wonders with visual effects, showing us a highly realistic-looking sleeper ship, and a zero-g environment on board, that neither looks overly cartoony or overly CG'd.<br/><br/>Cameron does not overindulge us by making us look at everything in detail, but neither does he rush through details in an attempt to stay grounded to the script. It's a perfect mix of showing us nifty creatures and inventions without stalling long enough to make us think he's showing off.<br/><br/>The Na'vi start off looking quite real, but very blatantly CG. There's a slight sense of artificiality in the Avatars when they are first on screen, and shown awakening and interacting with humans. But as the movie progresses, the effects seem to get better and better, to a point where towards the end, when Na'vi and Humans interact, both of them look incredibly REAL, as though the Na'vi were a huge puppet, and yet it's entirely CG.<br/><br/>Where they went all-out with the visuals, they completely lost it with the story. It becomes less \"Avatar\" and more \"Dances With Wolves In Space\".<br/><br/>But the story doesn't treat this as a surprise. Nor does it even try to be distinct. You know exactly how characters are going to react to situations. You know exactly what's going to happen next. You know that the Generic Nerd Sidekick appears jealous and resentful of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) now, but you know later on he's going to become the HERO who tries to save him. You know that Sully is going to be initially hated by Action Girl Love Interest (Zoe Saldana), but eventually get her to love him, You know that Bad Ass Action Girl (Michelle Rodriguez) is going to betray the humans and side with Sully and the Na'vi. You know which characters are going to die. You know that Sully will earn the trust and respect of the tribe. You know that Sully is going to admit he's been spying on the Na'vi, and cause Action Girl Love Interest to cry and scream and hate him and tell him to go away, You know this and that and everything.<br/><br/>It's all so obvious that it becomes stupefyingly boring, and you wouldn't have ever noticed that fact if the movie weren't so much fun to look at.<br/><br/>But while the effects and even much of the story was interesting enough to keep me drawn in, the most spectacular visual effect focus was on the Na'vi themselves... and the Na'vi themselves, as a society, were a breakneck yank out of immersion, and into a silly realization: \"They are exact alien copies of Native Americans!\" They are exact copies, from the mohawks, to the way the Elder Father and Mother characters look and sound, to the high pitched yipping sound they give in battle, they are EXACT COPIES of Native Americans.<br/><br/>It would seem to me that this element was lazily left in from the ripping off of the plot of \"Dances With Wolves\", and that would probably be a great discussion point, but like a great many modern \"PC\" portrayals of Native Americans, they sugarcoat them so much, they become just as racist as the Savage Red Man (Blue Man?) portrayed in older stories.<br/><br/>These Na'vi Americans are so in touch with their environment, they can talk to animals by sticking tentacles in their hair into plugs coming out of the animals' heads.<br/><br/>They can wrap these tentacles around long tendrils from the \"Tree of Souls\" to pray directly to their God. They have to cry and chant a ritual chant every time they kill an animal. They use bow and arrows, ride on animals, and make yipping sounds like the Natives in old \"cowboy and Indian\" movies.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be so bad, and it never really ventures into a racist depiction (especially since most of all these are ALIENS and not Native Americans), but the parallels are too strong to ignore---this is not even a metaphor or parody, these Na'vi are nearly word-for-word copies of stereotypical Native Americans.<br/><br/>But since these AREN'T Native Americans and they ARE aliens, James Cameron can get away with essentially portraying them as the stereotype of the \"in perfect harmony and touch with mother nature\" good guys, whereas the Humans, with the exception of only the obvious ones and the Nerdy Pacifist Scientists, are all evil, greedy scum who can't do anything with a planet except rape it and kill it slowly for resources, as though environmentalism efforts today would never ever work out or catch on. THANKS FOR THE FAITH, CAMERON! It's a stereotypical \"White Men vs Indians\" tale of the 90s, with the evil Humans being thwarted by the holy Na'vi.<br/><br/>And yet we get the Unfortunate Implication that the Na'vi apparently could not have survived or banded together without the leadership of Jake Sully, White Man Sky Person.<br/><br/>THANKS FOR THE SUBTLE RACISM, JAMES CAMERON!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I remember nearly a decade ago in autumn of 2002 purchasing a new game called Metroid Prime for Gamecube. I had enjoyed the hand-held Metroid titles on Gameboy Pocket and Gameboy Advance. I had no idea how the sidescrolling series would transition into Nintendo's 6th generation home console. As I finished the prologue and landed on Tallon IV, I was in awe as to what Retro Studios had created. The planet on which the game occurs is as realistic and detailed as any game I had played prior to that point. Before I started adventuring, I spent a while looking around the ship and taking in the planet. It was an immersive visual experience that I have never forgotten. The plot isn't of note, but I didn't care. I wanted to see the world through Samus' eyes; to take in the creativity of a group of people.<br/><br/>I know what you expect to read isn't a video game review nor a personal blog entry. In attempting to review Avatar, I continuously felt the same exhilaration I felt when first playing titles like Metroid Prime. James Cameron's film is like a video game in its preference for style over substance (not that all video games are like that). I think if audiences will walk into this film in 3D with that mindset, they will appreciate its accomplishment. It is not a masterpiece, nor is it a thinking-person's film. Avatar is the culmination of generations of science fiction fan's unconscious wet dreams. Of all the fans through the ages that have enjoyed the works of media specialists as far apart as Jules Verne and Yoshio Sakamoto, only King Cameron was able to acquire the money to create the ideal sci-fi world.<br/><br/>What little actually happens in this film follows a science fiction tradition that non-fans often appropriately criticize. It's derivative. It copies someone else's idea (in this case Dances with Wolves, The Last Samurai, and our cultural guilt caused by slavery, Jim Crow, and the Trail of Tears). In this version of the story, soldier Jake Sully heads to a moon called Pandora to work on a military base. He is offered the chance to create an \"avatar\" of himself which is modeled after the blue three-meters-tall inhabitants. He can enter a chamber and form a link with his avatar to take on his new persona. One scientist asks him to use his avatar and interact with the locals. Said locals or Na'vi are hominoids who live a peaceful, naturalistic life among the forest. They even have their own religious beliefs, language, and cultural practices. Sully becomes involved with them and after a series of breathtaking montages, is accepted into the Na'vi and falls in love with one of them.<br/><br/>This first half is fortunately very predictable. I didn't have to feel caught up with what was happening, so I could enjoy the film as Cameron intended. What Cameron does best in this half is depict the entirety of Pandora on screen. Nothing in the background is static and every frame has new details for audiences to enjoy. The unintelligent creatures roaming the surface have their own look that isn't replicated in others. Like in Metroid Prime, I was pleased by sitting back, not watching Jake, and looking around him. When the blu-ray is released, try watching it muted. I'm sure you will be able to have a nearly equitable 162 minutes. I'll not boldly say that Avatar is the Star Wars of this era. That film isn't story driven at all (in its first installment) but is instead an orgy of special effects.<br/><br/>Avatar follows its stunning first half with a Transformers inspired second half. No, it is far too conceptualized for such a comparison, but the allusions are obvious. The Na'vi, led by avatar Jake, and soldiers clash in the air for some unimportant plot detail. It was at this point when I enjoyed the film the least. Because of the on screen war, I didn't get to see Pandora. Cameron's film follows a tried-and-tested underdogs-become-champions formula that unfortunately has to resolve itself. It undoes his intention of displaying his artistry. Pandora doesn't vanish, but we see far too little of it.<br/><br/>Avatar isn't a perfect film. Like the genre which it represents, it fails under critical scrutiny. The Na'vi have long, dark, and braided hairstyles and are voiced by mostly black voice actors. The soldiers are almost entirely white. So, in the tradition of science fiction, there is an edge to the film which both sides of the political spectrum and people of all ethnicities have noted. Anyone remember the homophobic passages from Stranger in a Strange Land? What about the Bedouin-like inhabitants of Tatooine? Unlike another overrated 2009 blockbuster Inglourious Basterds which is actively insensitive to cultural taboos, Avatar's faults should not be seen as egregious. Unfortunately, science fiction is a world dominated by white men, and, therefore, our cultural perception results in disparity. I don't like it either, and Cameron could easily have resolved this problem by mixing up voice actors and soldiers but he didn't. Maybe the Na'vi could have had no hair. Still, he didn't do it and we have to live with it.<br/><br/>What legacy will Avatar have? I've no doubt it will spawn at least two sequels and a meta-series of novels, video games, and comics. Once Cameron's self-invented cameras and 3D technology are widely available, will people still be fascinated with it? I think they will, but not to the degree they are with real-life films like Dances with Wolves. Those films while equally predictable follow real life cultures in an apologetic yet glamorized role. Should you go see Avatar? Yes, I think you should. It's the King's world, and we're part of it now. But please, no DVDs, standard definition TVs, or 2D screenings.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar set a new standards for movies even beside the SF genre, in the same way that Matrix had done a decade earlier. Watching Avatar in 3D has been one of rare occasions when cinema theater turned into a place of magic.<br/><br/>Whether you like James Cameron's output or not is of lesser importance here. The whole industry and millions of fans awaited this release and he fulfilled the expectations. Avatar was obviously made to be seen in 3D and the world (or worlds) depicted in it are spectacular.<br/><br/>As far as the story is concerned, things haven't been as exciting as the visuals. A lot of people claim there had been some kind of higher message in Avatar. The only one i might think of is the guilt about the treatment of North American Indians by the authorities of what today is their homeland. Otherwise this has been another SF thriller with a lot of nice action scenes.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Seldom, you find a movie that takes you into it and enthralls you right from the start to the last frame. And only after the movie is over, you realize that man, the joy ride is done now it's time to leave and wish that it would have been there for some more time. AVATAR is one such experience. What is it about?<br/><br/>It's in a way story of person saving his race and fighting for it. He wants love, he wants trust. But never did I feel that it was told splendidly as it was done in AVATAR. When a guy who has lost his legs jumps in joy we feel man I would have done that too. When a person with his courage has won the trust of many and feels to lose it then he would do anything to get it back. Each nuance was stunning and oozing in beauty and splendor. A new world PANDORRA has been created and AVATAR makes you feel right there, you can touch those ferns, those plants, those wild animals (or monsters, I can't term them). The screenplay is perfect with each new scene revealing something new and by the end we can figure out what each thing was all about.<br/><br/>A scene, in which the lead couple takes a ride and explores PANDORRA, is just one example of beauty that this movie has. The editing is awesome and the acting is apt. The background music, (I concentrated the least as the visuals were too very stunning) is just perfect. But hey, it's not a movie where all these things should be looked into. Just sit in a 3D thing put your goggles and see for the first few minutes after the time would just flew.<br/><br/>Kudos, to James Cameron for visualizing AVATAR all in the brain and his crew who meticulously draw translated his vision to screen. It's surely worth the time it took in making and for me it's worth every penny and every second I spent watching it.<br/><br/>It's not a must see but a must experience movie. 5/5</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron, whether you like him or not, certainly knows how to make a big blockbuster and fill it with dazzling visuals and epic thrills. The Terminator and its sequel are 2 of the best science fiction films ever made, while Titanic, despite receiving what might be the biggest backlash of all time, is also a very good movie. Avatar? Not so much. This tale of a human using an avatar to live among an alien race and learn about them has by the sound of it already been done by Disney and Kevin Costner. This is a groundbreaking special effects spectacle, but not much more than that.<br/><br/>It's a bit depressing this is the highest grossing movie of all time. There are good reasons why this one's reputation has gone down in recent years. The plot is formulaic but interesting, and the special effects are amazing to look at but the film has a lot of flaws. I don't hate Avatar, but I don't like it much. I get the impression people turned on it after a second viewing. I didn't like it the first time. I watched it again recently and my rating remained the same. It's the most overrated science fiction film of all time in my opinion, and definitely one of the weaker billion dollar movies.<br/><br/>In terms of positives, the main thing about this are the visuals. The visual effects are brilliant, and while it can look artificial it still pulls you in. The film is stunning to look at, and most of the acting is pretty good. The standout performance is Zoe Saldana, who's excellent performance as one of the aliens didn't get as much attention as it should have. The film has some interesting themes, which are wasted in favour of visuals but the inclusion of a more drama filled story is appreciated. The scene when the home of the Na'vi is destroyed is genuinely affecting, and there are some good bits.<br/><br/>Aside from that, Avatar is all style and almost no substance. Avatar barely feels like a movie. It feels more like James Cameron showing off how good he is at VFX with a vague story thrown in reluctantly. The screenplay is bland and lacking in emotion, while the thought provoking themes are wasted. James Cameron isn't even at full directional power, as every shot goes out of its way to show some scenery and this means some of the action scenes lose tension. Avatar is a work of art and like most modern art, it's weak, soulless and lacking in meaning. I also sure he could have coped with shortening it a bit, as 160 minutes is totally overlong. Don't even get me started on Sam Worthington.<br/><br/>Overall, Avatar is a remarkably average film that was hyped to absurd levels and it's utterly outrageous that while The Dark Knight wasn't nominated for best picture, this was. It's a hollow and aside from the effects generic movie and not something many would want to watch more than once (Unfortunately I have). Not a terrible movie, but a huge disappointment and certainly not Cameron at his best.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It's been 12 years since we last saw James Cameron's visionary directing on the big screen. He previously graced Our Cinemas with the Likes of The Terminator, Aliens and the rather popular titanic. The latter went on to gross more than 1.8 billion dollars worldwide and bag 11 Oscar's. Now he's back with another epic, Avatar. It's been 12 years in the making, now it is being realised in glorious 3-D.<br/><br/>The story is set hundreds of years from today on the distant moon of Pandora. The planets a lush, vivid place full of beautiful and deadly creatures. The population that inhabit this planet are the Na'vi, they are big, very fast and athletic with a knack for not taking the humans lightly. The film centres on Jake sully (Sam Worthington) a paraplegic marine who is offered a second chance at being a soldier. He is asked to fill in his recently deceased brother's boots and head to Pandora. The First thing you will notice about this film is that it looks incredible. Every single blade of grass has been fully detailed. The motion capture technology brings the Na'vi to life, with every emotion being realised. This is truly from a visionary point of view, a work of art.<br/><br/>You are transported to the Moon of Pandora and it's a marvel if you are seeing it in 3-D, as intended. You are then introduced to the main characters of the film. First you meet the rather joyful and impressive colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) He gives a stand out performance as a stereotypical American Grunt, a rather over used cliché by the Canadian director. You are then introduced to Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) who has affection for the Na'vi, and looking for a way back into the indigenous population's community.<br/><br/>You will notice through the film that there are many references to James Cameron's previous work Aliens. There are a few small similarities' and one big, Aliens is arguably Cameron's best work, so it's not a negative. The role of Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) will remind you of Carter Burke, the slimy all business Executive from Aliens. The score by James Horner, who also worked with Cameron on the 1986 hit leaves a familiar taste in your mouth. Cameron originally wanted Michael Biehn to play the role of Quaritch but thought the audience would get confused as Sigourney Weaver is also in the movie.<br/><br/>The introduction of neytiri (Zoe Saldana) is powerful and exciting, You get the impression that she knows how to handle herself, This is a trait of all Jim Cameron's heroines. She introduces us to the Na'vi culture, and in the process, we start to care for and understand the advanced race.<br/><br/>The film flows well; it can drag at times, especially in the middle act of the film. This could have been improved with an extra RDA encounter, to further mount the tension between the Na'vi and the inpatient humans. The Action in the film is amazing, real hard hitting stuff. But it is in no way mindless. Every scene of action has been carefully crafted, by the trusty hands and eyes of James Cameron, Who has a knack for getting the audiences, pulse racing. The final battle lasts around 40 minutes long and it is defiantly a sight to be seen.<br/><br/>Final Thought's: On a technical level the film is a triumph with moments of wonder, the action is top notch to boot. The script and story can let it down at points, but that is no reason not to see the movie.Avatar is like a beautiful painting. What you see is what you get, and what you get is nothing short of epic.<br/><br/>A moment of brilliance: The final battle scene is as good as they come.

Scientists there have created \"avatars\" which are a cross between humans and the indigenous blue Na'vi people; Sully is asked to use his avatar to befriend the locals and get them to leave the area so mining can expand.<br/><br/>The movie blends live actors and computer-generated scenes to make a story that reminded me a lot of \"Fern Gully\" (1992); both have innocent Mother Earth-loving natives pitted against evil industrialists, lush forests with a pleasing color palette of greens, pinks, and purples, and even a sacred tree. This movie is lovely to look at and the 3-D effects are fun, even if much of it does seem like a fancy comic book. The actors are all fine, the animation is well done, and the script is exciting, if predictable. Recommended for fans of animation, action, and adventure.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I went in not expecting very much from Avatar having seen the trailers and reading about the story and of course I was right not to expect much. This movie is a bad Saturday morning cartoon. It's too long and too boring. It rips off too many other movies. If you're going to use a story that has been done too many times i.e Pocohontas, Dances with Wolves, The Matrix,even District Nine you'd better have either a compelling star (that is someone we want to see in this movie) or a twist that is interesting. This movie didn't have either of those things. Also you know I wish that writers would really take a good look at their material before they turn it over for use. The dialog was terrible. Too much narration, you know you're in trouble with a story when you need narration to move the story along. The visuals were nice but we've seen if all before, nothing new here at all. I only gave it a six for the pretty colors.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"2001: A Space Odyssey\" forever changed the look of movies in 1968 and Avatar does the same thing in 2009. There is no doubt that Avatar is a groundbreaking film. It's a giant leap forward in the use of CGI combined with 3D technology that immerses the viewer totally in the film. <br/><br/>To director Cameron's credit, he does not use the 3D as a gimmick.<br/><br/>Having seen A Christmas Carol, the Robert Zemeckis 3D film only a few months ago, Avatar makes it look amateurish by comparison.<br/><br/>The flora and fauna of the planet Pandora are the real stars of the film. This is a richly detailed jungle world inhabited by a huge airborne predator, the Banshees (smaller flying reptiles), the Direhorse (a six legged horse-like creature), the Hammerhead Titanothere (a large herbivore with a head shaped like a hammer) and the fearsome Thanator which is a panther-like creature straight from Hell.<br/><br/>The flora are equally well imagined and beautiful. There is the Tree of Souls, The Tree of Voices, Woodsprites (like airborne jellyfish) and Helicoradian which collapse into themselves when touched.<br/><br/>This is a film that comes around only once in a lifetime.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The visuals were stolen from the work of Roger Dean who designed many album covers for bands in the seventies -significantly Yes whose Close to the Edge album and Fragile's covers are the template for the floating islands in this movie. The story is a B-movie fifties western set in space. The script is lousy - who in their right mind would use Unobtainium for a rare mineral that the earth people want? Maybe in a draft script but not in the finished article.<br/><br/>A shedload of money was spent on this film and while it looks great and is fairly visually appealing nothing makes up for a dull story and script and unsatisfactory acting. That said the actors did as well as they could with material given that it must have all been done against green screens. I am rewatching this film again with few expectations - the visual plagiarism of Dean's work seems even more blatant and inexcusable. The script is full of clichés as are the characters but on bluray there is no denying the quality of the image. The blatant theft of Roger Dean's artwork still makes my blood boil and to read that a court action brought by Mr Dean failed beggars belief. I find it hard to believe that 4 more movies are made out of this material as there was only just about enough of a plot for this first one and that was stolen form a 50's B western.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">When I was 10 years old, I remember seeing Terminator 2: Judgment Day in the theater. And when Arnold first saves John Connor from the T1000, I recall the vivid awareness that I wasn't just watching that Summer's action Blockbuster. It was something more. At the time, I didn't really know or understand that feeling. But years later, when I'd revisit T2 it would click into place.<br/><br/>I wasn't watching a movie. I was watching a Dream.<br/><br/>Across the years, I've been blessed to encounter a handful of other films that gave me that same feeling—the feeling that I could close my eyes, and awaken to a new world of distilled imagination. Blade Runner, Pan's Labyrinth, Metropolis, and Nosferatu are a few names on that short list. Early in Avatar, when paraplegic Jake first links with his Na'vi avatar and races across the Pandoran landscape, exhilarated to be running again, I leaned forward in my seat and smiled. Once again, I wasn't watching a movie. I was watching a Dream.<br/><br/>Avatar uses the classical narrative structure of a man who must step beyond his culture, become one with a society alien to his own, and ultimately make a stand with his new brothers. And unlike previous telling of this tale, Jake can literally step outside of his human skin and take on the form of a blue-skinned and golden-eyed humanoids called the \"Na'vi.\" <br/><br/>Neytiri, a female Na'vi, guides Jake in the ways of her tribe, and as they make this journey together a bond forms between them. \"I see you,\" she whispers to Jake. \"I see you,\" he whispers back the way two lovers might exchange \"I love you\"s. And there couldn't be a more appropriate expression of affection for these characters. \"I see you.\" Director James Cameron wants to open his audience's eyes, as Neytiri opens Jake's eyes, to the breathtaking sights of Pandora. But unlike visual effects masturbations like G.I. Joe and Revenge of the Fallen both of which throw CGI out randomly in an effort to create the most/biggest/boomest explosion, Avatar aims to recapture the child-like wonder of experiencing a *vision* that, to quote Manohla Dargis, \"really is bigger than life.\" <br/><br/>Another director would be content to show the majestic floating \"Hallelujah\" mountains in the distant background, but not James Cameron. He goes further and invites us to climb them with Jake and the young Na'vi hunters. After dangling perilously from vines and rock faces and clawing our way to the top, Cameron then lets us ride on the back of winged dragon-like creatures, the Mountain Banshees, and soar above and between this magical landscape of towering miracles and impossible valleys.<br/><br/>But more importantly: amidst the overabundant spectacle, Cameron never loses sight of that child-like curiosity driving all fantasy. Do you remember staring at the cover art of your favorite book asking, \"What would it be like to fly? How exhilarating would it be holding on to a Banshee for dear life while it dove 300 feet straight down? To feel the roaring wind rush past with the intensity of a hurricane as you fly—really, truly, honestly fly?\" James Cameron remembers asking those questions.<br/><br/>He's filled the world—the vision—of Avatar with sights both grand and subtle. This is a movie that will go full throttle into an epic battle where a legion of Banshee-mounted Na'vi fly fearlessly through the airborne mountainscape while the military gunships unleash a hellstorm of missiles, and yet it also has the patience to let Neytiri reverently pause to observe where the drifting Seeds of Eywa fall. It will show you giant colorful dinosaur-like creatures smashing through trees in the all but obligatory stampede sequence, but look closely when the Na'vi get ready to ride a Banshee and you'll see gill-like orifices through which the creatures breathe. The world of Avatar feels bigger than life, yet I felt like I could reach out, grab a sample, and take it with me.<br/><br/>Is Avatar perfect? Far from it. It blatantly contradicts itself during the climax and brushes a little too close with propaganda in places. But like a dream, it didn't matter. When you've looked across the Pandoran landscape at night and absorbed the mystical beauty of the self-illuminating flora, when you've felt the thrill of watching Jake command the meanest predator on the planet and unite the Na'vi tribes, when you've *seen* Avatar \n",
       "  you don't care about its logistical faults.<br/><br/>It's a movie about sights, and James Cameron isn't shy about that point. It's the heart of the film. It's in every frame—in the very fabric of the film. Hell, it's even spelled out in the dialogue.<br/><br/>\"I see you.\" <br/><br/>In the cold mechanical adult world of unforgiving cause and effect, Avatar is the movie to reawaken the forgotten child of so long ago. The child who believes in searching for undiscovered frontiers to explore, who believes dragons and magic exists, and who believes dreams are real. It's always refreshing finding out our inner child is still alive, that the jaded real world hasn't killed him off entirely yet.<br/><br/>Thank you, James Cameron.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's sci-fi epic is worth the 3D cinema experience only for its distinctiveness and visually-striking effects, but the 162 predictable minutes is what's most bitterly memorable. Fantastically-designed tales like Avatar only need to be kept at the 2-hour limit. The extra 40 minutes don't catch anything new, and continue with the same tedious battle sequence.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Avatar reasonably earns all the trash-talk and hate, but apart from the tedious plan are handfuls of other pros. Pandora, the film's fantasy setting, is beautifully-depicted. The alien-like creatures and the land's fantasy animals are also amazing. But the most remarkable pieces of cinematography finally arrives at the climatic action and warfare. Who wouldn't describe this movie as one of the most visually-unforgettable films of all time, if not the first?<br/><br/>Avatar is also a movie that'll either bore you or entertain you. It generally keeps us entertained, but is way too dragged out and includes too many tiresome moments to describe as perfect. And the touch of weak romance on the side also seems quite unnecessary. For science fiction movies with a typical tale, the acting is occasionally questionable, but remains decent. It honestly probably not worth the $500 million though, unless of course you're a massive sci-fi/fantasy/action fan.<br/><br/>If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Not only does this film bring animation to life in a big way, it creates such realistic dense environments, especially if you had the pleasure of seeing it in 3D at the cinema where the forest came alive right in front of your face. The whole world had to switch from film projectors to digital if they wanted to show this film in 3D. Cameron, once again, changed filmmaking technology and set a standard just like nearly every other film he made. The story theme itself has been used throughout history, but none did it as big and meaningful as Avatar.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">No, the film itself is not disgusting. It can't even generate negative emotions. It generates no strong emotions at all. What it does for the most part is bore you to death and make you wonder what kind of mentally challenged person made the film.<br/><br/>What IS disgusting is that the mentally challenged person in question is rich based on this pathetic pile of garbage that would have resulted in him being kicked out of film school had he ever submitted that script. This film deserves ridicule and Cameron deserves to be treated with contempt and disgust. This is even below George Lucas level, in his Star Wars 'prequels'. Let that sink in.<br/><br/>What do you say about this film? Morph a smurf, a kitten, and a puppy into one, refer to them as naive (I mean, 'navi'), make them frolic in ridiculous CGI video game universe and then send super-evil bad guys who are somehow even less than one-dimensional and who run around in somewhat larger versions of robot loaders from 'Aliens'. This is 'Dances With Wolves' made by a retard. And I am choosing my words carefully. I honestly, without a hint of hyperbole think that the level of this film equals that of a mentally challenged person.<br/><br/>So now we know what Cameron is - in addition to being a cynical money-grabbing destroyer of genuine art.<br/><br/>It was all about money: how much it cost to produce and how much it made. He cleaned out our wallets faster than his bad guys cleaned out his fake CGI forest.<br/><br/>Zero stars for this, and once again: utter contempt for the 'filmmaker' behind it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I was reluctant to watch this movie as it did have some less than ringing endorsement in some reviews. Mostly I was reluctant to watch this movie as it was as huge as James Cameron's \"Titanic\", and I had some issues with how the story in that was told...watching \"Titanic\", I kept thinking that there were better ways that the story could have been told (I reviewed that movie here too). The positive comments I'd heard about the 3D experience made me want to see this movie...eventually. Watched it last week.<br/><br/>Anyway, I had less problems with this movie than with Titanic. There have been numerous articles in the press about plot-holes in \"Avatar\", but I steered clear of reading them. Can't say that I really noticed too many or thought that they ruined the movie.<br/><br/>It was my choice to watch this movie at iMax, here in Australia, as I find their screens more immersive and, more importantly, their sound levels are loud and deep and powerful without being deafening like the suburban chains are.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie concerns a human expedition to an inhabited moon in a far flung galaxy. Humans seek to mine a certain mineral but have humanoid natives to deal with. They try to get the humanoids to accept mining on their moon voluntarily. There is also a large military contingent accompanying the humans...presumably just in case the natives are amenable to their plans.<br/><br/>To get the natives (known as \"Na'vi\") to accede to their desire to mine their moon, the human contingent have created hybrid human/Na'vi bodies, in which to transfer the consciousness of people like scientists and military personnel. These hybrids are the \"avatars\" of the title. The strategy is to gain the trust of the Na'vi and have them agree to their plans.<br/><br/>Things don't go according to plan. One of the humans, Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington), falls in love with one of the Na'vi (Neytiri, played by Zoe Saldana) when he is inhabiting the human/Na'vi hybrid. Part of Jake's essential conflict is a moral choice between carrying out the humans plans versus respecting the wishes of the Na'vi.<br/><br/>Pandora, the moon the Na'vi inhabit, is magical to look at, and even more magical when experienced in 3D. It is a well realised world...copious plants and exotic animals dwell on it. It's this world which makes \"Avatar\" such a compelling movie-going experience.<br/><br/>My initial impulse was to give this movie 9/10, but I'm giving it 8/10 as the one thing this movie lacks is an emotional core. It's wonderful to look at, but it was mostly spectacle to me, and not much emotional involvement.<br/><br/>I do have to say though that it's my impression that it's a very human characteristic of colonisers to at first wish to destroy anything which does not bow to their will. After all resistance has been crushed, nostalgia is created for the vanquished...place names take on native titles, as do streets etc. One can say that \"Avatar\" has its heart in the right place, but it is a heart full of nostalgia for what must 'necessarily' be destroyed in the real world of the coloniser. In this way \"Avatar\" is a \"what if\" kind of story...and maybe one I feel sympathetic too, as applied to the real world.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Forgive me, I'm going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here. I haven't had the jitters after a film the way I've had for Avatar in quite sometime. James Cameron's Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life. It is incredible, simply put. What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler's List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.<br/><br/>Avatar is the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na' vi, the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora, where there is a precious ore, that sells at a ridiculous amount. When Jake learns the ways of the Na' vi, his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy.<br/><br/>The performances here, in the sense of reacting, becoming, and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding. Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando, Tom Hanks, or Diane Keaton; these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives. This is all based on character movements and reactions. Sam Worthington, as Jake Sully, is an actor who's on his way to becoming a star. Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film, he gets the job done. Zoe Saldana, who plays Neytiri, a Na' vi huntress, is thrilling and electrifying. Stephen Lang, as the rock hard Colonel Miles, takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction. He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily. Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr. Grace, is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron. She lives inside her role with effortless ease, but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines.<br/><br/>Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level. The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness, but when the second act takes off, it's sky high with no limits for James Cameron. Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time. That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism. I sat on this for two days before charging it out, but I mean it. It is the best visual experience of my life, period.<br/><br/>Other than those visuals, the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one. Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time. The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds, enticing the viewer and shifting us around. Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year. It was if the viewer sat down in a chair, put on glasses, and was literally placed on Pandora, spaceships, and floating mountains. The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery, you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees. Avatar is utterly hypnotizing. James Horner's score is some of the best work done in his career. It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears. It goes back to his work on Titanic, where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely. The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals, machines, and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron's exquisite film.<br/><br/>James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back, bigger, badder, and mature in his crowning work of his career. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore. This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart. He's a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards. You have admire the raw, natural talent the man has. How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off? The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics' awards. His screenplay, leaps and bounds better than 1997's Best Picture Winner, is primed, developed and ripe for the taking. Though, you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber, you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all. James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was, to put it bluntly.<br/><br/>Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi, who is as underrated as they come. Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci-fi epic. Joel Moore, showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball: An Underdog Story. And the classy veteran actors, CCH Pounder and Wes Studi, who just simply don't work enough.<br/><br/>Avatar is one of the best films of the year. The most exciting, thrilling, and superb work you'll feast your eyes on in any theater this century. Cinema, forever, will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself, but for any man, daring to change the game, the way Cameron did. Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered, and please experience in a movie theater first.<br/><br/>***½/****</div>,\n",

I finally watched Avatar 10 years after it's release. It's entertaining though familiar. The plot is filled with the usual characters -soulless, corporates and good guys.

This is the only reason - and by all means a sufficient one - to go to the theatre. The overall story is also relatively believable although surely not original. However, given the investment this movie got, the huge potential was only partly realised. <br/><br/>And why? Because at some point they forgot they were making a movie, not a CGI demo. The dialogues are so annoying, childish and empty, it makes sitting through the movie with the sound on a real challenge. I don't want to hear exclamations of 10-year olds if I'm to get interested in the plot. I don't want to be force fed what's going on, I don't want one dimensional characters and so little respect for the intelligence of the audience.<br/><br/>So I have to admit very mixed feelings on recommending this movie.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">A technical wonder built on recycled components. Like its Oscar competitors \"District 9\" and \"The Hurt Locker\", James Cameron's \"Avatar\" is an amazing technical achievement (although with a $270million production budget, one would hope so) but not an overwhelming compelling story. Cameron turns his \"Aliens\" plot of bad-guy aliens infecting humans on its head -- good-guy aliens must defend themselves against humans who have figured out how to infiltrate genetic copies of the aliens. The alien \"Na'vi\" strike more than a passing resemblance to native American tribes or at least a Hollywood version of peaceful, nature-respecting, earth-connected natives. Cameron's aliens are all lightness and good even beyond those found in Disney's \"Pocahontas\". Cameron's bad guys are the Marines from his \"Aliens\" feature and the sleazy corporate executive role first played by comedian Paul Reiser. Sigourney Weaver also returns and provides the middle ground between the sweetness-and-light aliens and the rapacious humans as well as providing the technical bridge our hero, Jake Sully (boy, there's a movie character name) takes to transform, like Wikus in \"District 9, into one of the aliens. Cameron throws in some mountable, flying dragons from \"Eragon\", some \"Jurassic Park\" dinosaurs some of which fly and some of why have hammerhead shark heads and most lazily some \"Beauty and the Beast\" wolves and \"Dances With Wolves\" horses with a few extra legs thrown in. Yes, you've seen it all before elsewhere but never rendered by someone with 5 years and nearly $300 million to spend. The effects are immersive and impressively seamless; I especially liked that the arrows thrown around by the 11 foot Na'vi look like spears when they puncture the hapless humans. In short, in this year's Best Picture Oscar race, \"Avatar\" is the New York Yankees and we all know how that series turned out.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is James Cameron's science fiction epic that has broken the mold for movie making. For years we have been hearing great things about the progress and set backs for this film. Since 1997, Cameron has yet to release a feature length film, excluding some of his work with IMAX and his documentary/3D films like Ghosts of the Abyss. 12 years after he broke all of the box office records with Titanic, the most successful film of all time, Cameron has come back with a bang. A big bang. Possibly the biggest bang in cinema history.<br/><br/>Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic Marine, is sent to a distant planet to follow up in his brothers footsteps. The planet is Pandora. A world filled with strange, magnificent fauna and flora. It's a world filled with vibrant colors, breathtaking landscapes, and a tribe of intelligent life called the Na'vi. Underneath their village lies a rich deposit of a very rare and profitable metal. In order to avoid a hostile takeover, the military has permitted Dr. Grave Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and her Avatar program to try and persuade the locals through education, compromise, and good will that they are not to be feared. The program takes the DNA from the Navi and humans and combines them to create Avatars. These Avatars allow those whose DNA is in the Avatar to plug in and<br/><br/>Dr. Augustine's science department is at wits end with Colonel Miles Quatrich (Stephen Lang) and Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), the forces driving the drilling and military presence. They share one thing in common; an interest in Jake Sully. Sully and has his hands in both pots. He is the only person who can operate his brother's Avatar and he has an obligation to serve his military superiors. Sully is put in the difficult situation of making contact with the Na'vi and giving information to both Dr. Augustine and to Colonel Quatrich.<br/><br/>I don't want to go into too much detail about the plot and the characters. That was the one part of the movie I wasn't too excited about at the onset of the film, but as the story played out, I became more and more involved and grew to accept and understand the story. It sounds and looks almost too ridiculous, but trust me, it works.<br/><br/>I have seen a lot of science fiction movies. I have seen a lot of 3D movies. Never before have I seen a movie like this before. The clarity in the depth of vision Cameron creates is astounding. A friend of mine compared it to looking through a window, rather than the movie popping out of the screen towards you. I couldn't agree more. Needless to say, Cameron waited just the right amount of time to make this one.<br/><br/>What make the visuals so outstanding is the attention to detail on each individual effect. Everything from the mountains and tree tops in the background all the way through the foreground is so clear and detailed. It's astounding! From the very first moments of the film when Sully is lying down and water droplets surround him, every scene has something to wow the audience.<br/><br/>The cast has a wide variety of actors, the biggest of which is Weaver. I expected a solid performance from her but I was surprised by Worthington, whose only screen credit I had seen prior to this was Terminator: Salvation. Lang and Ribisi too give excellent performances. Even Michelle Rodriguez does a fine job. The actors that we can't see, like Zoe Saldana and Wes Studi, do a fine job as some of the the Na'vi leads.<br/><br/>I felt a certain enjoyment that I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was like watching Batman or Jurassic Park again for the first time. A kind of thrill that you experience on a roller coaster. There is so much to fall in love with here. I would have no problem saying that this is the best movie of the year. It's almost in a class of it's own. Avatar is the dawn of a new age in cinema. Where we are not bound by the constraints of technology. It's proof that if you can dream it, you can do it. James Cameron sought out to create a mesmerizing, groundbreaking film and he accomplished just that and more. The doubters who thought he would fall on his face are now the ones picking themselves off of the ground.<br/><br/>The future looks bright for big budget movies. With this new technology and new way of story telling, audiences can expect more high quality entertainment. James Cameron goes all in with each movie he makes. His next movie is called Battle Angel, another futuristic tale about a female cyborg rescued by a scientist. Sounds crazy. I can't wait.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">All I can say is....Holy (BEEEEP!) This film was the most incredible spectacle to date from the grandiose director James Cameron. What a wonderful tale of new creatures and awe inspiring scope of landscape. I was on the edge of my seat watching this biting my nails waiting for a new twist and turn. The effects blew me away in every form, and the story was heart touching in every way. To see a alien species who connects to their own planet by what we know of as neurological stimulus. To have flowers or even the animals coexist with this lovable race. And one paraplegic soldier who stood in the middle of chaos and destruction, to pick a side and to become the new warrior tribe leader who leads them to victory. James Cameron really did his study and writing to give the audience a beautiful way of showing us how important life really is through organic contact at the deepest level. I can just imagine what is in store for us when his next film is done. My hats off to fellow Canadian James Cameron, thank you for giving us such a fantastic movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It has to be said that if you've seen Dances With Wolves or any of the other pseudo-humanistic, post-hippy films in which man learns better ways via the good offices of 'natives' far more in tune with nature and that his way of life isn't everything, the story in Avatar is not going to surprise you. Best stick to the visuals, which are stunning. James Cameron might be all clichéd thumbs when it comes to telling a human story, but with his creation of the planet Pandora, he has come up with an imaginative alternative to Mother Earth. But is that enough to sustain the movie? No, not really. The plot is very straightforward – man needs to get his greedy mitts on a mineral (called, believe it or not 'unobtainium' – is that some kind of in-joke?) which exists on the planet Pandora, but that planet's indigenous people, a blue-skinned race who are 'in tune with nature' are naturally not too chuffed about the rape of their planet. Throw in a couple of extremely bad guys – the military man and the corporate man who will stop at nothing, not even genocide, to get the stuff they need - and the film is set up for a pretty conventional trajectory. Then there's a paraplegic marine who starts out as being more aligned to the bad guys, but is finally won over to the right path by the love of a good woman, and so the cast of two-dimensional characters is almost complete. Almost, because there is also the anthropologist who wants to find out more about the blue-skinned 'natives'. Much of the film is taken up with the marine/native hybrid undergoing rites of passage and it is more or less a sentimental smooze fest, great if that's your bag, not so great if, like me, it makes you all a bit queasy. Naturally, this being the kind of 'nature knows best and we had better listen to her voice' tract, there is wall-to-wall music which is equally as sentimental. So, to coin a phrase, there's rather less to Avatar than meets the eye. Granted the stunning recreation of an alternative planet – stunning even if like me you watch the DVD on a laptop and don't get to enjoy the full 3D experience – goes a long way to making Avatar something of a standout production, but even that can only take you so far. So far, so Hollywood. So far, a great one for Saturday night with a bag full of popcorn and lots of super-stunning visuals. But, given the obvious allusions made by Cameron and his producers, allusions to the Vietnam War, the cultures of the African people, the Native American tribes who also attempted to resist the encroachment of 19th-century 'sky people' – land rather than unobtainium was their prize - and given the allusions to the 'war on terror', I feel I might be allowed to take my cue and add a few, rather more pointed, comments. The real story of the Native American fightback ended in outright tragedy for them all. Several millions were killed, all of them were displaced and dispossessed, and for many the result of white man's greed is misery, alcoholisms and perpetual unemployment. Cameron's Avatar has the obligatory feelgood happy ending, but the conclusion of the Native Americans' fightback was anything but a happy ending. And before anyone thinks this review has developed into some kind of anti-U.S. rant, let me add that the French, Brits, Dutch, Germans, Spanish, Portuguese adventurers who scoured the world and destroyed peoples in their insatiable search for minerals and wealth were equally as nasty. And to add insult to injury they all insisted, po-faced, that they were trying to bring 'civilisation' to 'savages'. In the light of that do Cameron and his producers really think that a multi-billion piece of what is at the end of the day 24-carat sentimental feelgood drivel can make up for what was done to those several million Native Americans and other indigenous people? I rather think not. But back to the film: as standard Hollywood stuff, Avatar has what it takes, and will do just fine if that's what you like. Best not to take it in the lightest bit seriously, however.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Rewatching James Cameron's \"Avatar\" isn't as enjoyable when it currently feels worryingly prescient (now more than ever) to our times - considering recent unfolding events...<br/><br/>In fact it feels more like a relevant, preemptive warning made by the legendary filmmaker from 2009 - &amp; with the benefit of hindsight, how differently things could've played out if only we'd paid closer attention to his foreboding message.<br/><br/>An oppressive authoritarian regime - led by a narcissistic, American egomaniac who will never accept defeat, feigning the embodiment of \"law &amp; order\" - glorifies violence, intentionally exacerbating fragile tensions, jeopardising diplomatic relations between two groups with unnecessary provocations so diplomacy deliberately fails - in order to brazenly justify further, unregulated &amp; aggressive military intervention - subjugating the retaliatory uprising with brutality &amp; intimidation...<br/><br/>I literally began the film - one of my favourite movies of all time - so I could hopefully forget about what was going on across the globe for a while... And now all it does is remind me of the world we're presently living in.<br/><br/>Although I do know deforestation &amp; corruption etc. Has always been a thing, it feels closer than ever to reality at the moment - regardless of the sci-fi insanity.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">My first thought was, the 3-D isn't as good as I was led to believe, but then something straightened out. I'm not sure whether it was my brain or the screen, but either way the problem cleared up fairly quickly. (Though pretty entertaining I don't think the movie is going to suffer much from begin watched in 2-D.) My second thought was, everyone who fancies himself a little above average or more in intelligence should be forced to watch this film. If you're right, you will come away convinced you've been touched by the work of someone far more intelligent than you. If you don't feel that way, you're initial assumption was clearly wrong.<br/><br/>This film is not miraculous in an off-putting sort of way. It is geared to reach the average American mind. The thing is, I remember having similar sentiments as this film, years ago, and I would have bet anything that getting ordinary Joes to sympathize with its point of view was an exercise in sheer futility. That to me is the real mark of genius in this film, that James Cameron was able to make it so that no one is likely to escape being confronted with its message, though whether they believe it or not, I can't say. The whole of my own belief about this country's foreign policy to date is stated fairly simply in a very few words. It begins with: \"We want something someone else has...\" There's no doubt in my mind many won't care, but this film will stir the optimism of the rest of us about there being sufficient numbers of those who do care to make a difference.<br/><br/>Everyone in this film does an exemplary job. There's a slight skip of a beat in the middle but, if it hadn't been there, I might very well have stumbled out of the theater totally disoriented, unable to snap back into my humdrum life.<br/><br/>What a stunning accomplishment!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I just saw this with 2 other people tonight on December 26th and we all loved it. One thing that came to mind watching this film; it's going to be hard to top. The CGI, and this film is a CGI fest, is top notch with exception of a few little scenes here and there. Anyone working on a CGI film going forward is going to have to work very, very hard. Also, the acting is top notch by everyone in my opinion. You may not like the human characters but the actors did a good job. Some of the story is quite predictable-we've seen some of this before. I can't say the story is original however, there are very original components to the story that keep it fresh. Some of the CGI sets are wonderful with phosphorescent plants growing in the forest that the characters walk, run and hunt through. The story is engaging and I don't think the audience had time to think about their cell phones and Blackberries during this. I recommend this. It's a long film but the time flies by.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Every so often, there comes a movie that changes the way movies are seen, displayed, and filmed. These are the movies that visually change all the rules. Back in the late 30s, we had the instant classic Wizard of Oz, which was visually groundbreaking in every possible way. The colorful 60s was led by the epic acid trip 2001: A Space Odyssey. The Star Wars trilogy dominated the box office in the 70s and 80s and constantly set the bar for movies to come in terms of special effects and the overall visual look. Jurassic Park in 1993 and The Matrix in 1999 are other major examples. In 2009, we have our new special effects peak, and that is Avatar. The difference is between Avatar and all the other groundbreaking spectacles is that it's a visual trip that doesn't scream for a requirement of a second visit. While Avatar never dwells into disappointing or boring, it never propels to a level that has you begging for more.<br/><br/>However, if there is something amazing about the film, it's the special effects. Motion-capture technology had been hit-and-miss for a long time, but James Cameron and his team have perfected the skill. A beautiful environment and setting emerges from the special effects as we see images and settings we've never seen before. This is basically a Star Wars for the new millennium, as its box office run has proved. The amount of effort placed on the visual effects is obvious here, as we see an alien species move, breathe, talk, and interact so realistically, you may forget that these creatures do not exist in the real world. Apparently there are people reaching some sort of subtle depression after leaving the movie theater because they suddenly know the beautiful world of Pandora doesn't exist (True story). Like previously stated, it all looks very nice, but the film is a 3-star helping served in a 5-star manner.<br/><br/>Avatar's plot follows a handicapped soldier (Sam Worthington) trying to earn the trust of the creatures in the planet of Pandora in order to try to find a way to move the entire colony away from an area chock full of valuable minerals. This is a road often traveled, you know that at some point he will realize that what is doing is wrong, and at some point he will realize that the other people he is traveling with (American soldiers, businessmen) aren't going to care either. The script borrows major plot elements from Disney's Pocahantas (even if it is loosely based off a true story) and Dances with Wolves. The plot is part of the reason why it's such a global phenomenon; it's hitting all the well-accepted messages of anti-militarianism (not a word, don't care), pro-environmentalism, anti-deforestation, and themes of accepting other cultures. James Cameron has worked with some of these themes before, like Terminator 2 and The Abyss.<br/><br/>The special effects and direction is what propel this movie into new heights, not just on the quality of the film, but the overall structure of cinema. You are transported into this new world, and Cameron adds these elongated sequences so you can become comfortable with Pandora and all its mystical wonder. Unlike Spielberg's patience to reveal his special effects tricks in Jurassic Park, Cameron gives you only 10 minutes and you will already become acquainted with the reason you came to see the movie in the first place. The motion-capture is flawless; the CGI is inches away from perfection (very, very limited amount of awkward-looking scenes), and the cinematography was spectacular. The camera moves and flows with the action seamlessly, and you always get a good visual grip of what is going on. The details were immense, as Pandora's overall look is a blend of beautiful scenery we have seen before and images that we can only dream of.<br/><br/>Of course, reading this far, you know flaws shall become exposed and discussed. What makes Star Wars such a timeless masterpiece is not only its look, but the immense amount of out-of-this-world characters, unique settings, and impressive maneuvering through these environments. Jurassic Park remains a classic because of the lovable characters driven into a world they can't possibly survive in. With the case of Avatar, only the main character is likable, and everyone else is there just to propel the story along. In Avatar, the main character is the planet Pandora. In the other movies, the beautiful and never-before-seen-in-film scenery is just a backdrop for the events happening. Avatar doesn't suffer from Star Wars' mediocre dialogue, but it does suffer from an elongated running time, unnecessary scenes, and filler moments.<br/><br/>The second act is where your patience is tested. The entire scene of our hero Jake adapting to Pandora could have been shorter. The entire scene of Jake's first evening as a Na'vi could have been shorter. What makes them seem longer is that you know what's going to happen next, and you have to sit there and wait for the more-impressive and more exciting third act to develop, when the action becomes center-stage. The final act makes up for the second act, with some intense fighting and plenty of tension and suspense. The ending, albeit a bit short, was fitting and consistent with the themes and tribulations of Avatar.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Avatar looks good, it looks like nothing you've ever seen before, but the story is something you've seen before, and the characters are people you've seen before, and the overall film is a well-known cliché, even if it's an amazing-looking cliché. James Cameron does a fantastic job updating the world of special effects, but with a repertoire consisting of The Abyss, Terminator 2, Aliens, and True Lies, one would ask for a better overall cinematic experience. Seeing it once was a delight, but wanting to see it again is something not in my heart's desire.<br/><br/>At least it is better than Titanic.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This does contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Technically well made. The animation seen here humanizes the characters as good as classic Disney. Top production values all around.<br/><br/>However, unlike Disney, the animation effects somewhat upstage all else from time to time. This cannot be said to be a major fault as the great visual effects are the big selling point of the film.<br/><br/>The greatest flaw, in my opinion, is with the story. It is the classic mighty modern cavalry v. the stone age natives. The weak natives are predictably doomed. Be it the American Indians being cleared away by the Europeans, the Tibetans being conquered by the Chinese, the Palestinians being eradicated by the Zionists, or the Aztecs being beaten and enslaved by Cortes, etc, witnessing the long-winded slaughter of innocent natives is not exactly enjoyable.<br/><br/>AVATAR fails to make the doomed storyline an asset to the movie as a whole. Different viewers may have other personal tastes, but for me AVATAR is not worth a second viewing.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">For some reason I decided to read the \"Hated It\" comments before writing my own. Almost without exception this pompous crowd opined that AVATAR was merely \"eye candy\" and nothing else; e.g., so-so script, acting, storyline, ending, etc.<br/><br/>\"Eye candy\" has been an feature of film for awhile now, only somewhere about 100 years, when audiences gasped at the moon beings in \" A TRIP TO THE MOON\". It was certainly scary candy to the early 20th century viewers who ran out of the theater when the train directly approached them on screen. We were still eating movie \"candy\" when the Mighty Kong climbed the Empire State Building. The rubber suited creatures in \"THE TIME MACHINE\" had me afraid for weeks. I also caught a buzz on the film that journeyed into the human body in a yellow submarine, certainly a thoughtless piece of fluff. Personally my ignorance is demonstrated by having loved, at 12 years old, a\"JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH\" and other Jules Verne adaptations, not to mention just about any other flick starring dinosaurs, space creatures and dudes from beyond the grave.<br/><br/>I might also point out an relatively unknown director named Steve Spielberg who has produced an abundance of mediocre fodder full of tricks and sentimental effects that captivated and pulled tears from a sap like me. It seems you cerebral brainiacs see right through those gimmicks that have me leaving the theater with tears and/or smiles.Why, I should've told my kids to dry those eyes and/or wipe those smiles off their faces and get down to some serious business!<br/><br/>Message to the snob egghead crowd who believe themselves above a jolly good time. Stay home. Most of us wouldn't enjoy meeting you anyway. Apparently you were born 30 years old, infertile and over educated. If by some some chance you academics managed to actually parent a pre-teen who you took to the movies and who remained enthralled by AVATAR for the rest of the day, be sure to sit him/her down and instruct your son/daughter that such was just industry junk. I'm sure he/she will be the better for it.<br/><br/>PS: To you nerds who believe me a complete idiot, Read some of my reviews on low budget domestic dramas and other stuff. You see, I really want to pretend I'm as smart as you guys. But you know better because I liked AVATAR.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">You gotta hand it to James Cameron. The man has a knack for spinning a fantastically wonderful tale with some of the most cutting edge special effects ever put on film. Most of the time, I couldn't tell what was real and what was not. THAT is the beauty of a special effect. It serves the story and is believable unlike the crap in Transformers 2. But the most important aspect of all this, from the acting and dialog is the story. The story, simply put, resonates so closely with our real-world and it's historical context; most notably when mankind exploited and destroyed the environment for profit at the cost of human lives. It's really refreshing and interesting to see a film that challenges and criticizes our capitalistic, militaristic, and imperialistic attitude and ambitions, at a time when our collective conscience is slowly but surely blinding us from the truth. This is a wonderful film with a wonderful message and I for one am glad I saw it because it reminds me of just how beautiful and fragile our world is and in order to ensure that beauty lasts for generations, we all must do our part to make it happen.<br/><br/>This films got it all. Intrigue and mystery, suspense, humor, action, romance and just pure fun. Although I would've liked more background info on the planet and it's inhabitants but sometimes it's good to be teased or in this case, kept in the dark about it's eccentricities. Hopefully we'll see a follow-up to this grand and epic tale that will flesh out more of Pandora and judging by the film's phenomenal box-office performance, it's highly likely it will come into fruition. But until then, I will come back to see it again for the second time. A third and fourth viewing is not out of the question. One of the best Sci-Fi films I've ever seen and ranks up there with the best movies of the decade.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's an eternal rule of film-making that the story-arc must be powerful and the lead roles believable for any movie to make it into the top few hundred of all time. On this basis, Avatar will be quickly forgotten. The story is hackneyed and the dialogue is bland and delivered without much conviction. Director James Cameron has to take the entire responsibility for this failure, since he takes sole credit for the script. The special effects and photography and costumes are mind-boggling in 3-D, which is why the picture is watchable, but they will not combine to thrust the picture into legend. The gigantic budget of the movie could easily have gone towards dozens of engaging little films such as Juno or Once, allowing many writers and directors to get on to the big screen. One point that is key for me: Avatar breaks every single rule laid down by the Dogma Film movement(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95) that has produced so many excellent low-budget cinema experiences.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">With a tale built on great excess came excessive criticisms at both ends of the spectrum. So is Avatar the most awesome spectacle in cinematic history, or a dire, blue-hued re-telling of Dances with Wolves? In truth it's neither. It's simply (emphasis on \"simply\") an enjoyable sci-fi romp – albeit one that could have done with a little more science and a little less romp.<br/><br/>We come to terms fairly quickly with the fact that we're not dealing with three-dimensional characters, but rather archetypes playing out in 3D. So Pandora and her population's plight takes centre stage. It's a laudable allegory about Native American displacement, massacre, and Five Nations coalition. Except here the animism is more than spiritual delusion, being a detectable, neuro-chemical network stretching across the entire biosphere. Sadly this interesting concept is only properly explored in a single five-minute scene; and yet Jake Sully's (a blank Sam Worthington) adoption of his flying steed, with all its rippling wings and nose-diving peril, lasts three times that.<br/><br/>Which perhaps represents Avatar's greatest problem. Cameron is so in love with his world, and so intent on making us fall in love with it, that we spend too much time in idle admiration. No wonder the natives are known as \"The People\" – they exist as a single narrative entity as tour guides for Cameron's dreamy interior. As Sully predictably falls for Neytiri (a luminous Zoe Saldana), it's really the world he's learning to love, not her.<br/><br/>Special mention should go to Stephen Lang for his joyous pantomime performance as the monstrous Colonel Quaritch, and the first bearable performance from Giovanni Ribisi since... well... ever.<br/><br/>With Titanic and now Avatar, Cameron seems to be letting The Abyss's climactic wave crash; taking a new delight in observing the stupefaction of crowds of little people as he unleashes upon them his thunderous acts of god. (Now in 3D!) Given the director's considerable ego, I wonder if, in the dreamboat passengers tossed about like ragdolls, and in the twisted faces of his Na'vi, awed and agape, it might be you and I he sees.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The hype was definitely big; over 10 years in the making. The ultra secret film project that would push the boundaries of film making to its limits. With that promise, a whopping budget and James Cameron's reputation on the line, \"Avatar\" was born. At the start of his career, James Cameron brought to life his nightmare about an unstoppable cyborg killer, now he has realized his vision of a beautiful dream. \"Epic\" cannot even begin to describe this marvel of a movie. It surpasses every other blockbuster that has come before. Plus it has brains and heart to boot, two things other big special effects laden movies like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen tend to forget.<br/><br/>Much has been said about Avatar's less-than-original story. In the year 2154 on a faraway moon called Pandora, the RDA corporation has been attempting to mine precious \"unobtanium\" minerals while fending off attacks by the local \"Na'Vi\": a race of tall, blue skinned natives clearly inspired by Native Americans. Enter Jake Sully, an crippled marine who is sent to replace his brother in the \"Avatar Project\" which involves transplanting the minds of humans into artificially created Na'vi bodies in order to facilitate better inter-species understanding between Na'vi and Humans. But Jake is given new orders from the corporation; infiltrate the Na'vi tribe, learn their secrets and convince them to relocate before the military is sent in to remove them by force.<br/><br/>Similar to his previous work on Terminator in which James Cameron took a typical horror/slasher movie structure(unstoppable killer going after helpless teenage girl)and tailored it into an all time classic, Avatar's story is, at its core, just a mix of well known cinema clichés. The story of a soldier who is taken in by some natives and ultimately fights with the natives against his former comrades is nothing new, having been done most recently in \"The Last Samurai\". But Cameron manages to bring all those familiar elements together and craft a sweeping tale that is as compelling as the world it takes place in; it is not the individual elements, but the end result mix that works so well. On the surface, it is a grand science fiction fantasy adventure that anyone can understand and enjoy. Dig beneath that surface and you have an entire cast of interesting characters as well as clever allusions about the recent war in Iraq, metaphors about corporate globalization, and even deeper philosophy about an individual's life purpose.<br/><br/>A word of warning though: Do not, i repeat, DO NOT watch this movie unless you watch it in its full 3D glory. While most 3D films \"pop up\" in your face, Avatar does a different approach. Instead of popping out, it immerses the viewer into the visual experience with a realistic field of depth thanks to a technique of filming that mimics the way our eyes perceive distance. This revolutionary filming method makes the magnificent CGI world, creatures and characters all the more majestic to behold. Forget Star Wars, forget Lord of the Rings, AVATAR is the new benchmark of visual effects excellence. Even the more hardcore fan-boys of science fiction would be drooling at the attention to detail the production team put into fleshing out not just a never-before-seen world, but original creature designs and even an entirely new language for the Na'Vi(and let us not forget the most realistic portrayal of robotic mecha in the history of digital films). After a short while one would would forget that the Na'Vi are just digital effects and come to emotionally connect with those lovable yet tragic creatures. That is the extent of realism that the revolutionary CGI and amazing acting gives to the digitally rendered Na'Vi. The human characters are also perfectly cast and even the \"bad guys\" have a certain appeal about them. (special mention goes to Stephan Lang's character of Colonel Quaritch, easily embodying the definition of \"bad ass\" and giving \"Apocalypse Now\"'s Colonel Killgore a run for his money.) <br/><br/>While almost Flawless in its execution, only one personal nitpick would be that perhaps Avatar would have worked better with a longer running time or split into two movies. The final act where Jake goes from outcast to Na'vi savior in 10 minutes felt a little bit truncated and more time could have been spent on Jake Sully's back-story, but those are just minor nitpicks if one wanted to be really fussy.<br/><br/>Emotionally engaging, thrilling, entertaining and breathtaking. Avatar is James Cameron at his best; showcasing his abilities as an blockbuster movie director who can balance action with emotion, bang with brain. Battles are edge-of-your-seat thrill rides, beautifully choreographed and filmed, bringing \"awesome\" to a whole new level. From start to finish, Avatar succeeds at everything it set out to do and easily lives up to the hype. Avatar is not just a film, but an entire world born from the mind of James Cameron, created from scratch and ripe with possibilities. It is an indescribable experience that one should not miss out on. Future blockbuster directors would be hard pressed to live up to the standards set by this grand modern masterpiece that would easily become an immortal classic in no time.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Two things first, one, I couldn't decide on wheather to give this film a 7 or 8, so I gave it an 8, but i would probably only give it a 7.5. Second, I just saw this film, on DVD, not on the big screen, not in 3D, not even on blu-ray, and I found it entertaining.<br/><br/>Everyone seems to be calling this film either great or horrible, and the reason is because without the effect, this film is just a rip off of dances with wolves. Well, I never saw that film, I found this film good on the small screen, though the effects aren't as good as they would have been on the big screen, they were still good.<br/><br/>So yes, it was a good movie, but does it deserve highest grossing film of all time, no. I do say that this film is in my top 10 of 2009, and even my top 100 films. But it isn't good enough to be my favorite film of all time.<br/><br/>I give it a 7.5 for entertainment and how nicely it's made.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This is the second time I've seen this film and so a lot of press has been written about it since its release; some of it is referred to here:<br/><br/>'Pocahontas in Space', 'Fern Gully meets Terminator', these are just two of the comments I've heard about this film since its release. I can see why it has attracted such 'derisory' comments, but I can also see (from a second viewing) just what Cameron was trying to do. Yes, the story is predictable and, for the most part, we've seen it all before in another guise. But there is an underlying message about greed that seems to get missed my many reviewers. It is all a bit too 'touchy, feely' for some, but personally I didn't mind it all that much. At the end of the day I did find it entertaining (if a little schmaltzy in places), but even so, still well worth a look\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I've been pondering this before putting proverbial pen to paper. it has some of the most ludicrously overblown and cheesy central metaphors in the history of cinema. the existence of God, The destruction of the amazonian rain forest, the overthrowing of native American Indians, colonialism, interracial relationships, gene cloning and stem cell scientific potential for abuse, good versus evil, the folly of war, the unfair use of \"shock and awe\"...shall I go on? And yet, and yet...<br/><br/>And yet this is a wonderful and deeply involving, even affecting movie. Why? Because James Cameron has invested his heart and soul into it. That much is very obvious. And this comes across as one man's lifetime obsession. It's like Coppola's Heart of Darkness (Apocalypse Now) in outer space.<br/><br/>It opens like a scene from one of Cameron's great early movies (Aliens - with a set that compares) and the sight of Sigourney Weaver climbing out of a Cryogenic Sleep pod. Clearly his own little Alfred Hitchcock moment, or a wee joke for us boring buffs.<br/><br/>Technically this movie raises the bar like no other film since Star Wars. This is the iphone of the movie world. the 3D impact is quite simply mind-blowing. No men with long poles sticking them out of the screen into your face. Not a hissing Cobra to be seen. No, this is \"immersive\" in that you feel you are being drawn into a layered experience where there appears to be multiple depths of field, but all in focus. The scenes where the \"Tree of Life's\" spores fall through the air enveloping characters is really quite unique and beautiful.<br/><br/>Then there's the world he creates. One just wonders where he started. The military stuff takes on Star Wars but doesn't overcomplicate. It throws in a dash of Bladerunner technology, but mostly it just bowls you over with its apparent functionality. Pandora, the other world that our characters are mining for \"unobtanium\" (great cod scientific name), is endless in imagination and quite simply, paradise.<br/><br/>The Avatars themselves, 10 foot high humanoids, are beautiful and beguiling and 100% believable.<br/><br/>They really could be real.<br/><br/>The acting is good enough. The script passable.<br/><br/>But the denouement, which brings it all together in a localised War of the World's is breathtaking and so long and so absorbing that you just cannot believe this level of ingenuity would actually be possible.<br/><br/>But, apparently, it is.<br/><br/>It all hangs together in a way that makes this one of the most unforgettable trips to the cinema I have ever had. No, it's not art house, but who cares. It is just a thing of greatness. A testament to James Cameron. I would not grudge him the Oscar against his ex wife whose own action movie could hardly be any different.<br/><br/>Methinks it is a straight shoot out between the two.<br/><br/>(Michael Haneke is unlikely to get the look in he deserves.) A straight ten (despite the reservations).</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This science fiction adventure film set in the 2150s has very good special effects - but that's its only appeal.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"Avatar\" is not the next \"Star Wars\" or \"Lord of the Rings.\" It might be the next \"Matrix,\" though. Or, perhaps more accurate, the next \"Matrix Revolutions.\" It's technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after \"Return of the King.\" There are a lot of bad guys, a lot of good guys, and sooner or later they're all gonna meet on the battlefield. The little details are not-so-shockingly unimportant, since nothing could stop, change or even, really, comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film's story.<br/><br/>It's the future. An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora, mining the planet of all its precious minerals. The native population, big blue humanoids called the \"Na'vi,\" aren't too happy about this. The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na'vi bodies to be controlled by human brains, in order to communicate to the Na'vi that...they better move, lest be bulldozed by the evil Col. Qautrich (Stephen Lang).<br/><br/>Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother, who had an Avatar made specifically for him, is dead. The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement. Oh, and he's paralyzed, so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him.<br/><br/>I don't feel as if I need to continue with the plot description. You know what'll happen. You've seen \"Dances with Wolves\" and \"The Last Samurai.\" Heck, even \"Dead Man.\" The Na'vi represent nature, the (all-American) corporation represents destructive technology. Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like, \"we have to fight terror with terror.\" The Na'vi are clones of Native Americans - filtered through the imagination of a white liberal. It's all very obvious.<br/><br/>The question, of course, is whether or not it's entertaining. Well...sometimes. It certainly looks good. Some sequences - especially those with the winged beasts - are eye-popping. Lang makes a fun villain. Pandora is more derivative than original, it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson's King Kong. All the monsters have a plastic-y look to them that make them feel too well-done. The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over.<br/><br/>But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty. It's worth seeing for that reason, but I don't think it'll be as fun after multiple viewings. The great thing about \"Star Wars\" was the characters: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and so on. They embodied the other-worldliness of the story, taking the weight off the effects.<br/><br/>In thirty-two years, I don't think anyone will remember \"Jake Sully.\" 6/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is an amazing film that shows the importance of peace, respect for other cultures, and care for the environment. The story may not be groundbreaking, but its setting and presentation makes wonders. We know the very similar story of Pocahontas, where a harmonious society was destroyed by the colonists. We know the story of the War on Terror [\"We will fight terror with terror\"] by an administration hungry for oil. Now, we see history repeating itself yet again, but this time on a foreign planet.<br/><br/>There has been immense hype regarding the 3D effects. While they are good, this motion picture is not a Universal Studios attraction. I feel today's 3D effects are not eye-popping enough to lure audiences by itself. What they do, however, is further enhance the story and contribute to the realization that this horrific possibility can definitely occur. You feel as if you are in this foreign world and empathize more for the native population. Even though this movie occurs far in the future, the movie's theme needs to be applied today, where we see terror all around us, where we see Mother Earth responding to mankind's ignorance and attempts to dominate Her.<br/><br/>Performances are great, and Horner's soundtrack is absolutely beautiful--a must have. Special effects are fantastic, and the new world and its creatures have been designed, built, and animated very creatively.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"Avatar\" (2009), wow, it's about time a different movie overthrew this one as the highest grossing film in cinematic history. How does this boring \"film\" deserve such an honor? All right, to be fair, James Cameron is a very talented film maker in the industry. He has written and directed much better movies than this one. But, this \"movie\" is a very close second just below \"Titanic\" (1997) as his worst film, in my opinion. \"Avatar\" has a lackluster and dull storyline, standard to mediocre acting, and a mostly boring soundtrack. The plot line behind this \"film\" is a very unique and creative one. When I watched the trailers, I thought: \"now this looks interesting, it looks like it's going to be great!\" Plus, I got really excited when I first saw that James Cameron wrote and directed it. Then, I saw the \"movie\" and, well..... I was overall just disappointed with it! I just thought to myself: \"what in the world happened, James Cameron? You had a great storyline idea, how could you possibly screw it up?!\" That's one of the top ten things I hate when it comes to movies and TV shows; wasted potential. Don't get me wrong, there are in fact some redeeming parts of the story. Particularly the scenes on the habitable moon of Pandora. Those scenes were very well-done and most of the action scenes were actually pretty good. Other than that, the story is very boring, cliched and it just drags on way too long. At 162 minutes, it is quite a lengthy \"film\". A movie like this one should warrant a running time in the range of 100-130 minutes. After 130 minutes, it just starts to drag on a little bit. Maybe if it was 30 minutes shorter it would have had more of an impact. Film Making 101: if you're planning on making a long movie, then you better know what you're doing. You want your audience to be invested all the way through from beginning to end. Sometimes, less is more! I don't mind a long movie well executed, but most of the time, long films are just too dull for me. As for the acting, it's overall just terrible from the whole cast. The only ones that seem to be trying are: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang and Michelle Rodriguez. Those four actors and actresses give the strongest performances of the whole cast. All of the other actors and actresses are just a joke. Which is a shame, they've acted well in other movies and shows! What's their excuse here? The soundtrack, composed by James Horner, does have a few decent moments. But overall, it's just a cliched and predictable soundtrack. That's pretty bad, because James Horner has written so much better film scores. Now for the positives, yes, there are indeed a couple positives for this \"movie\", the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are nice and give the \"film\" a great atmosphere. I especially love the sets on the fictional moon of Pandora, they are absolutely beautiful! Finally, the special effects are stellar, especially the motion capture of the characters on Pandora. That was very well done! At the end of the day, \"Avatar\" is just a disappointing cinematic failure. But, it isn't James Cameron's worst film though. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Unless you're only interested in sets/locations and special effects, I recommend staying away from this \"movie\". You'll just be ripped off!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I was 6-7 when I was watched this for the first time but it took place during the ending since it was streaming on some tv channel, I remembered glimpses of it but not fully able to remember everything. Now I have rewatched it for my review.<br/><br/>Solid story though somewhat linear and has flaws to it. Though it has minor themes, tbh the entire flim isn't as meaningful I thought it should be. The worldbuilding was abosolutely fantastic. You could do a whole analysis video on the flora and the fauna of the planet Pandora. The characters were good, some of their decisions and choices are bit confusing but they are written somewhat well and are likable. The visuals were gorgeous. Designing all the animals, plants, and the aliens probably took such a long time. The music was fantastic, very mystical and somehow energizing at the same time. And the writing was decent and the acting was great.<br/><br/>Overall an enjoyable flim that is by far one of the best high quality movies I have seen of all time, though not original and takes alot of heavy inspirations from other sources. The visuals were way ahead of its time. And I can the reason as to why it is one of the highest grossing flims of all time.<br/><br/>Memorable: No Rewatchable: Maybe to admire the visuals</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Like everybody else I eagerly awaited James Cameron's return. And this looked like such an ambitious return at that. Then the movie started. Between the crappy narration, stupid story, terrible dialogue, awful writing and unoriginal everything I don't know where to start. Of course Sam Worthington can't act.<br/><br/>Really the worst part about this is the writing. Everything that's said is dumb and the good actors try their best. The story is of course ripped off of Dances with Wolves. It would be one thing to take the basic idea, but this goes far beyond that. The main guy falls in love with the chiefs daughter, they fall in love while she's teaching him the language, he narrates the movie through writing his journal... I'm sure there's more.<br/><br/>This story isn't worth telling, it's been done so many times: evil corporation, money, invading native culture... Yada yada yada.... We need something new not the same message. and it's really hard to believe that with how PC everything is these days that in 200 years all of that would be completely gone.<br/><br/>Looking back on it the seeds of this started with Titanic. When Cameron used generic storytelling devices to get to his worlds. Titanic is original enough to work but this isn't. Also I'm sure after making the biggest movie ever that you're not going to hear a single criticism from anyone reading you script.<br/><br/>The world is really cool looking. But since it's all fake I wonder why they didn't go for it and make something completely fantasy? The Avatars look like humans with makeup basically. If I was going to CG everything I would take advantage and really utilize the CG and make something that couldn't be a guy in a suit.<br/><br/>But the worst part of all: Colonel badass. No subtly, over the top and borderline cartoonish. I don't know why he has a big duel with the main character at the end when they have absolutely no connection whatsoever.<br/><br/>I guess everything in this is heavy handed. It feels like Cameron hasn't watched a movie since 1997 so he's taking the next step in 97 terms. Now we know why he wrote this so long ago, it was right after watching Dances with Wolves.<br/><br/>I hope that Cameron just got lost in his love for the world and returns to the original film maker that he was.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">From the director of \"The Terminator\" and \"True Lies\" comes \"Avatar\". Not to be confused with the hit Nickolodeon program. Avatar takes us to a spectacular world beyond imagination, where a newcomer from Earth embarks on an epic adventure, ultimately fighting to save the alien world he has learned to call home.<br/><br/>We enter the alien world through the eyes of Jake Sully, a former Marine confined to a wheelchair. But despite his broken body, Jake is still a warrior at heart. He is recruited to travel light years to the human outpost on Pandora, where a corporate consortium is mining a rare mineral that is the key to solving Earth's energy crisis. Because Pandora's atmosphere is toxic, they have created the Avatar Program, in which human \"drivers\" have their consciousness linked to an avatar, a remotely-controlled biological body that can survive in the lethal air. These avatars are genetically engineered hybrids of human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives of Pandora... the Na'vi.<br/><br/>Reborn in his avatar form, Jake can walk again. He is given a mission to infiltrate the Na'vi, who have become a major obstacle to mining the precious ore. But a beautiful Na'vi female, Neytiri, saves Jake's life, and this changes everything. Jake is taken in by her clan, and learns to become one of them, which involves many tests and adventures. As Jake's relationship with his reluctant teacher Neytiri deepens, he learns to respect the Na'vi way and finally takes his place among them. Soon he will face the ultimate test as he leads them in an epic battle that will decide the fate of an entire world. Avatar 10/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I missed James Cameron's Avatar during its initial theatrical run, but managed to catch it in IMAX 3D on the last night of the extended edition's re-release. I wasn't all that excited to see it, to be perfectly honest, but I really wanted to experience it on the big screen and in 3D instead of watching it on TV.<br/><br/>Pretty much everything I had heard about this movie was right on the money. It's more or less a futuristic remake of Dances With Wolves, with a little Starship Troopers, Pocahontas and James Cameron's own Aliens thrown in. In fact, Avatar is, in a way, Aliens in reverse, with the Marines the bad guys and the aliens the good guys. There's even a scene in which the evil Colonel, strapped into a huge robotic suit, fights a giant alien monster. The scene is lifted right from the finale of Aliens.<br/><br/>However, despite the derivative plot, cardboard characters and cliché-riddled screenplay, Avatar is extremely entertaining and exciting. It is undeniably a visually stunning movie. Seeing it in the theater reminded me of the first time I saw Star Wars, Dune and the aforementioned Starship Troopers. The movie is a visual smörgåsbord.<br/><br/>Cameron is an extremely talented and nuanced director and he never lets the frame become overloaded with stuff. No matter how much is happening on the screen at any given moment, he manages to choreograph and direct it all so that it never becomes disorienting. Unlike Michael Bay and Peter Jackson, Cameron seems to prefer his audience to actually SEE what is happening, instead of throwing a bunch of shaky camera movements, rapid editing and flying debris in the audience's face.<br/><br/>The performances are all quite good. The actors play their roles with just enough over-the-top energy that it suits the massiveness of the movie, without becoming campy or trite. Cameron's screenplay is functional at best. He gets us from one point to another quickly and efficiently without ever stumbling in any significant way, but the dialog and characters are not particularly compelling. Even the subplot regarding Sam Worthington's brother being killed is glossed over without Worthington's character so much as batting an eye at the death of his sibling. The plot point is there for no reason other than to explain why Worthington has the ability to control his avatar, and once that has been established, it is more or less forgotten except for one or two throwaway lines of dialog. That pretty much sums up Cameron's attitude toward most of the motivational aspects of the script: explain it quickly and let's move on to the next action sequence.<br/><br/>The effects are quite good, and while the Na'vi are obviously CGI-created, they have enough soul to convince us that they are living, breathing beings. Personally, I found the intricate facial movements of the Na'vi to be kind of creepy at first, enough to be mildly distracting. It took a while to get used to, but I finally did.<br/><br/>I have not yet seen Avatar on TV. With less scope to carry the movie along, it will be interesting to see how well it holds up more on its visual style, story and characters than its sheer hugeness.<br/><br/>I'm not a big Cameron fan. I still think his best movie is the original Terminator. Aliens is a close second, but I think the rest of his movies are bloated and uneven. I don't think he's made an all-out bad movie (though The Abyss comes close), but he often gets lost in the spectacle and neglects the story and characters. Avatar is in the middle for me. It isn't great, but it's pretty good and Cameron manages to deliver a huge explosion of eye-candy without ever losing control of it. That is no small feat.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">After Terminator and Aliens, we got Avatar, set on a distant moon in a distant galaxy. We get a handicapped young soldier and his quest to seek out Pandora (the moon) and see the sights and help his company. Plus, we also get Michelle Rodriguez and Sigourney Weaver. And an all-new alien world. The special effects didn't hurt either. Sure, the story is a little cliched (Ferngully and Dances With Wolves anyone?) but it's not bad. The Na'vi stole the show as the moon's indigenous people and their customs and various creatures were so beautiful. This makes me curious for the followups. Hope they'll expand the whole Avatar story even further!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Storyline of Avatar is very similar to what America has done to innocent countries over the years. If you are foolish enough not to understand i am talking about all the invasions. The first invasion against the red indians killing them off. Then Vietnam for no damn reason and many others and the recent Iraq. I am not trying to create hatred guys as i am not saying Americans are bad. I am just saying that the leaders of this so called lovely country have F'd up the whole world. Using many tactics such as rape and violence against civilains and mind games, in other words Ignorance among people.<br/><br/>Coming to the point The Film. Yes it was a great film. Peace</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I went into Avatar with hopes of it being an intelligent science fiction movie, James Cameron has directed two of my favourite movies of all time, Terminator 2 and Titanic, but I remain convinced all he was interested in this movie was the special effects, and not giving second thought to story or characters despite the film being in production for a decade.<br/><br/>One aspect of Avatar which bothers me which I've never heard other reviewers comment upon is the fact that Sam Worthington's character of Jake Sully is paralyzed, being confined to a wheelchair at the beginning of the movie. However when he becomes an avatar and is not only is he able to walk in this new form, he's running and jumping through the forests of Pandora, so why is there no sense of liberation? Why is this character confined to a wheelchair if the movie never takes advantage of this as a definable characteristic? Am I only person who looked beyond the movie's special effects and actually noticed this guy is in a wheelchair, even in the movie's trailer we can see he's in a wheelchair, and I thought to myself, \"Wow, a protagonist in an action movie who is in a wheelchair , that's something you don't see every day\", but no, the wheelchair is there for no reason, if he wasn't paralyzed it would have made no difference to his character, or should I say \"character\", since no one in this movie has a personality.<br/><br/>Even more bothersome for me however is Colonel Milies Quaritch (and yes I had to go to Wikipedia to find out his name as the characters in this movie suck), or as I like to call him, Generic Army General Guy. This is one of the absolute worst, most uninspired villains I have ever seen. This villain alone proves that James Cameron spent a decade working on the technology for this movie's special effects and didn't give a monkey's about the story or characters. I was that shocked at how cliché this villain is that I can't even enjoy him in an ironic sense, instead, I just sat there in bemusement at a villain who belongs in a spoof movie, heck even 80's action movies have better villains.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm not going to beat the dead horses' skeleton regarding the movie's white guilt plot. I know humanity will always have its flaws and perhaps it just the optimist in me would like to imagine that in the year 2154 we would have learned something by then and won't be colonizing other inhabited planets because of greed, but if the movie at least made some acknowledgement of the actions in the film being a case of history repeating itself and even act as a cautionary tale, I would have been more forgiving.<br/><br/>I don't like CGI to begin with, it's one of biggest complaints about modern filmmaking, but I do acknowledge the technology can be put to good use when put in the right hands. The effects in Avatar are impressive, but to quote George Lucas (I'll presume he said this before he himself completely lost it), \"a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.\"</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The visuals in this movie, its stunning Jake and Neytiri are good characters my issue is everyone else is pretty 1 sided. General army guy and scientist nerd etc. But I never felt it slowed too much and I will be going to see the sequel when it comes out.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Much has been made of Hollywood's investment in 3D, and in \"Avatar\", 21st Century 3D technology has come of age.Director James Cameron has realised another world in a largely computer generated set which will take your breath away.Without doubt this is a landmark film in the technological advancement of film. Watching it in anything less than the largest cinema screen you can find in 3D will not do justice to this magnificent production.<br/><br/>The story itself, by contrast, is much more routine. Pocahontas meets Independence Day.The heavy \"green\" sub-text is a little over bearing, and the characters one dimensional in jarring juxtaposition to their setting.The world, on planet Pandora, is reminiscent of \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\" and \"Jurassic Park\" with prehistoric inspired creatures adding danger and colour to the forests.The bad guys in a far flung part of the universe want to plunder rich mining deposits which are inconveniently located where a hunter / gatherer Tribe exist in perfect harmony with their surroundings.As the bad guys muscle in for the booty the indigenous Tribe fight back, guess who wins? The modern tendency of big budget films to unfold in a computer game friendly way is very evident as was the case with \"District 9\" and \"Batman Begins\".Indeed,the climatic showdown feels as though it is shot as a computer game set.Yet the sheer scale and excitement of the action makes this a minor irritation.<br/><br/>The 2hour 40 minute running time is a little bloated with the first 40 minutes the culprit, as the scene setting is laboriously presented.But as soon as the action transfers to the Rain Forest, the pace picks up, never to falter. And it is in the Forest that the 3D effects stagger the viewer, giant birds swoop, vegetation has an incredible depth, and the battle sequences dwarf anything that we have ever seen in the cinema before for imagination and scale.An instant classic, set to have an impact for many years to come.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I went in with zero expectations, also to let you know where I am coming from I saw this just today (2019) on BluRay, so not exactly what I'm sure is the intended \"big screen\" way to see this, and not ideal sound either.<br/><br/>That said, from word of mouth and reviews I knew that the visuals and stunning CGI were the main selling point of this movie but technology moves so fast that I think my expectations were too high on this point and the effects here have already been surpassed. I've seen better recently, including in the Star Wars movies (for better or worse), so the effects in Avatar I found good (particularly the more background stuff, like the \"world\" the characters walked through), but not STUNNING. This is mostly true of the characters which I didn't think looked awesome at all.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I have no problems with it. Worthington wasn't awesome but certainly was good. I like Weaver in whatever work she does. The supporting cast were all good. And Stephen Lang stole every scene he was in. It's great to see actually because I see him pop up now and then but until now I've never seen him in a really big, successful blockbuster. He may seem like an overnight success to many but he's been around forever (as a kid I remember him doing a great job in a show called Crime Story along with a similarly gifted and surprisingly versatile actor named Ted Levine) doing all kinds of roles and always doing a good job with it.<br/><br/>So visuals were passable (obviously they were stunning at the time and are still impressive a decade later which is good). And the acting was good. Which brings us to the real failing here, the story.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have said this story is very, very unoriginal. Seen-it-before plot points and tropes are piled on top of each other and nothing comes as a surprise. It's slapdash thrown together pieces of Ferngully, etc, etc... natives and nature vs. progress and development. \"Oh my gosh we are the bad guys!\"<br/><br/>And it is ponderously overlong given the basic story, and how predictable it all is. I don't think this story surprised us once even in 3 hours (oh also the version I watched was the extended collector's edition - maybe that is not as good as the theatrical?)...<br/><br/>Actually it is a testament to the quality of the visuals, the cinematography, the actors (working in CGI world), and James Cameron's direction that this overlong heard-it-all-before story never actually gets unbearably boring. It wasn't good but was never boring.<br/><br/>I would give the sequels a chance, and will definitely be seeing the next one in the theater. Still the story will need to be much more original, much better, and frankly to be considered an all time great I think a movie should have more staying power than just a few years. It already feels old to me, and it isn't sticking with me (I'm not thinking about it at all really) the way I feel \"good movies\" do.<br/><br/>Just my two cents.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is the latest movie from James Cameron. It tells the story of Jake, a paraplegic war veteran, brought to another planet, Pandora, inhabited by the Na'vi, a humanoid race with their own language and culture. Cameron leaves the romantic stories to make what he knows best, an impressive sci- fi/fantasy movie. A combination of CGI and live action, Avatar is full of action and adventure with awesome special effects, a story the captivates and a plot that catches you from the very beginning. It has a very fast paced rhythm for a movie of almost three hours. Avatar has an excellent cast. Sam Worthington as Jake Sully delivers almost flawless performance. Zoe Saldana is very good as Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver in the role of Dr. Grace Augustine is great. Stephen Lang and Giovanni Ribisi both as the bad guys of the movie are very convincing and Michelle Rodriguez as the tough soldier Trudy Chacon with a very good acting job. In conclusion, Avatar is an entertaining and enjoyable movie. Very recommendable and more if its in 3-D.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron returns to the director's chair to bring us AVATAR that rises above being just another special effects feast that just sets to show off its big budget and groundbreaking CGI, the difference between AVATAR and many other big budget effects films is that here the effects work in service to the story and showcasing a splendid vision of what Pandora really is, a mystical land of both beauty and danger and lifeforms never seen before.<br/><br/>The storyline and performances are beyond reproach and the direction, well its James Cameron the guy brought us ALIENS, TERMINATOR, THE ABYSS, and TITANIC, could it be anything less than great? Overall, its a visual effects feast that is really a feast and must be seen to be truly appreciated.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Well the hype for this movie was unbelievable with headlines buzzing \"12 years in the making\", and \"1000's of man hours go into just minutes of this movie\" etc. It was without doubt a very well marketed movie, because I certainly got sucked in being that it was literally everywhere here in the U.K.<br/><br/>Still, James Cameron's goal is admirable. Where critics commented he was doomed to fail by making \"Titanic\" (1997), he managed to do very well albeit including a romantic subplot. \"Avatar\" definitely succeeds in the effects department, as it is without question one of the most beautifully CGI rendered worlds I've ever seen. Taking the novelty of 3-D (Usually being a method where an object is coming towards you), the movie makes very good progression when using it to instead aid and give the tropical world more visual depth (Although 3-D IS still a gimmick that I think will never catch on while glasses are involved).<br/><br/>A young paralysed soldier is drafted into the \"AVATAR\" program, to take over the role of his recently deceased brother. His job is to infiltrate a tribe of natives on the planet \"Pandora\", whose home is on top of a large mineral source where small quantities are worth millions. However, will the time he spends with the natives change and alter him? Or will he be doomed to stand aside to let the corporations harvest the jungle? <br/><br/>The story I have to say is flawed and in some areas is of course similar to other famous movies, most notably \"Dance's with Wolves\" (1990). But I still think \"Avatar\" has enough to be entertaining. Obviously more similar remakes and reboots are getting put out every year, and already in the same year \"BATTLE OF TERRA\" seemed to be ripping off Avatar and getting away with it pretty well. As far as casting goes, everyone does a solid job be it motion captured or not. Sam Worthington is growing on me here and there, and to see Sigourney Weaver on screen again certainly brought back a lot of \"ALIENS\" (1986) nostalgia to me.<br/><br/>Other than that, it certainly falls flat in some areas. I don't know how well to rate Cameron as I writer, but the script doesn't deliver anything particularly memorable throughout the two and a half hour flick. Of course somewhat being the first of its kind, there's always going to be a level of higher regard as a success or failure. The kid in me wanted it to win big at the Oscars that year, yet looking back \"The Hurt Locker\" more than deserved BEST PICTURE.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: As a technical achievement, \"Avatar\" is grand and gorgeous but unfortunately can't help but be a movie full of exposition, that is just \"showing off\" how far we've come only in terms of technology. All that said though, it is an enjoyable flick, albeit a very long one that makes you wonder how refined Cameron's planned sequels will be. 7/10. It's a lot of fun.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's Avatar is a breathtaking film of the first order. It's also a old theme us vs. them cowboy's vs Indians superheroes vs supervillians and so forth. However the story is set in the far future where we discover the planet Pandora. The inhabitants of Pandora are all one they're all connected with the planet the wildlife and each other their beliefs are that each are connected by one spirit one source of energy that binds them all. The respect they have for the planet is pure love. Enter the Human race Earth is dying our resources are dead or dying the planet must find newer resources to survive and as it just so happens Pandora has a lot of rare Minerals and resources that can allow us new sources of energy. But there is one problem the planet is toxic to us the air is deadly . SO enter the Avatar program. After generations of observing them and studying them they have created a Hybrid that can survive on the planet it is called a Avatar. It looks like the aliens it moves like the aliens but it is inhabited by a human conscience. Time is running out the corporations that now run the earth and the armed forces want these minerals and resources but the inhabitants don't want to deal they seem to us simplistic and naive. So enter Jake Scully a former Marine now paralyzed from the waist down injured in the line of duty.All Scully wants at first is to serve to be useful. Scully's brother was one of the men behind the success of the Avatar program but died in a senseless mugging before he could inhabit his Avatar. Jake's DNA is a match for his brother's Hybrid and Jake is given a mission find out all you can about them get them to trust you get them to give us what we want. and maybe when this is over we'll get you an operation to get your legs back. Faced with a incredible chance to get his legs back Jake becomes an Avatar. He goes in with a sense of wonder the planet is fantastic but he is alway reminded of what his mission is. Jake makes contact with the people as they call themselves they know he is one of them in a hybrid form but Jake convinces them that his misson is to learn all he can about Pandora. And he learns and as he learns he falls in love first with the woman instructed to teach him and then with the planet the people and their ways. At first Jake tries to convince them to deal with the humans but with time running out Jake begins to see just who is evil and who isn't and he tries to warn them that something horrible is about to happen. With only a few human scientists and a handful of other avatars Jake tries to rally the people only to find it's a matter of too little too late and Jake realizes the truth we are the invaders and Jake now must make a choice that will change everything he knows and everything he loves. James Cameron's Story telling abilities are at his best here. He creates a new world with a new people and new ways that seem at once alien and comforting to us the audience. While he finds a new way to present the human race is a way that's both familiar and horrifying Cameron pulls no punches here. James Cameron simply gives a simple story that is complex upon studying it. This is maybe his best movie of his career.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Gosh, where to begin.<br/><br/>I went into the movie with much trepidation, since I didn't want to sit through three hours of wearing 3D glasses watching CGI effects. Well, I'm glad I did. The 3D was a little dizzying for me with the swift action shots but Avatar was just about perfectly done in 3D, with the movie not being all about the effects but instead both being complementary of each other. And what effects they are. The money and time James Cameron spend has well been worth it. The forest scenes get a bit too pastel for me at times but everything else is just mesmerizing. It's hard to imagine watching the movie in 2D (though I think I might try).<br/><br/>For better or for worse, Avatar is another Titanic. So many parallels to make. There is obviously the big budgets and long years spent on both, and they're both great spectacles, for their time and for at least a long time to come. And both look to be to popular favorites and critical mehs. Titanic, despite sweeping the Oscars, received relatively few of the critics' awards that year, and this year, most of the latter has gone to The Hurt Locker. <br/><br/>Both were written by James Cameron, which is my main criticism with the movie. You'd think that despite 14 nominations and none for screenplay that Cameron would realize that he's not the best screenwriter and at least have someone co-write with him but no, his ego is king of the world. But I'm making the issue bigger than it is. Like Titanic, the plot and characters are simple, though Avatar has a more interesting background story for sure. But while watching this movie, I could easily foresee where events were headed, and what each character was going to do. \"My grandfather rode the big-ass pterodactyl and united the tribes in times of sorrow.\" Hmm.. I wonder if that tale will be relevant to the climactic battle scene later.<br/><br/>No matter, that battle scene is glorious, like most of the other scenes. Also like Titanic, Avatar isn't about the story itself, rather how it plays out. Watching Avatar gave me the chills I get whenever I watch a remarkable movie. Like a roller coaster, you can see the track and you know where it'll end, but gosh, the ride will send your heart a- fluttering.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">There comes a moment about two-thirds of the way into Avatar. The medicine woman of the Na'avi, wonderfully interpreted by CCH Pounder, watches as the home which has housed her tribe for generations is obliterated by the corporation mercenaries out for the ore that lies beneath it. She lets out a howl of anguish and the look on her face is the pure stunned horror of one seeing their dreams and heritage destroyed in one fell swoop. It is at that moment that I realized that James Cameron had succeeded and had not only drawn me into his story, not just visually, but emotionally, and had managed to make a strange race of blue aliens vibrantly accessible and credible beings. Visually the film is beyond critique. It succeeds beautifully in whisking one away to a world that heretofore could only have been imagined and, even then very limitedly. The film opens with former Marine Jake Sully pressed into service to step in for his deceased brother to utilize an avatar - a DNA-mixed hybrid of human and Na'avi - to attempt to learn what he can about the natives of the planet Pandora, who are proving problematic to the corporation and their hired gun mercenaries who wish to exploit the planet for their gain. He agrees to spy for gung-ho military overseer Quaritch, but ostensibly answers to scientist Grace Augustine who supervises the project. Despite his initial reluctance, Jake integrates into a tribe of Na'avi and learns to love his life in the avatar, and the humble lifestyle of the Na'avi as well. The planet Pandora is character onto itself - a stunning vista that seems constantly alive with vibrance, light and motion. Cameron has cast the film perfectly as well. Sam Worthington is restrained enough to be the perfect conduit for the viewer to enter Pandora, yet charismatic enough to be the kind of leader that one could believe in. Zoe Saldana amazingly interprets the Na'avi princess making her an inspirational character. Supporting roles are ably filled by Stephen Lang as a hissable villain, Sigourney Weaver in a wonderful turn as Dr. Augustine and Michelle Rodriguez, finally in an appealing role. A lot of criticism has been directed at the dialog, but any writing major can tell you that a screenplay is much more than dialog. It is primarily structure and Avatar is structured brilliantly - further none of the dialog rings hollow to my ears. Quaritch and company may be a bit one-track, but one would also be lying if they denied that their real life counterparts are easy to point out. Similarly, the dialog sounds fine to my ears - scientists talk like I imagine scientists to talk like (when an injured Weaver rouses herself enough to muse \"I need to take samples\" - it feels right!), military talk like what I have heard military talk like, and the dialog between Jake and the Na'avi seems to me unpretentious and works all the better because of that approach. I have heard rumblings of a sequel, but they really should not proceed down that line as this story concludes on a perfect note and needs no further expansion. I look forward to visiting Pandora and its denizens many times in the future, but at my movieplex or home video screen, not in a sequel. Avatar is a visually astounding and emotionally compelling film experience worth the ride.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">In 2154, the RDA corporation is mining Pandora, a lush, Earth-like, moon of the planet Polyphemus, in the Alpha Centauri star system. Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) heads the mining operation, employing marines for security. The corporation intends to exploit Pandora's reserves of a valuable mineral called unobtanium. Pandora is inhabited by the Na'vi, a blue-skinned species of sapient humanoids with feline characteristics. Physically much stronger and taller than humans, the Na'vi live in harmony with Nature, worshiping a mother goddess called Eywa. Humans cannot survive exposure to Pandora's atmosphere for very long and must use gas masks. Attempting to improve relations with the natives and learn about Pandora's biology, scientists grow Na'vi bodies modified with human DNA, called avatars, that are controlled by genetically-matched, mentally-linked human operators. The film focuses on Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic former marine that despite having no training whatsoever, becomes an operator.<br/><br/>Avatar has been in development since 1994 and it's James Cameron's first film in over 10 years. With an estimated budget of $280,000,000, Avatar is one of the most expensive films ever made. Thankfully for Cameron, the film is already the second highest grossing film of all time by ranking in 1.14 billion at the global box office. Cameron's previous film, Titanic is still number one but not for much longer. So, is all the hype and buzz surrounding this film justified? Not really. Cameron is indeed no stranger to science fiction, having done the Terminator films but, here he really tried to push the envelope; was he successful? Kind of. Visually, there's no denying it, Avatar is impressive, and it's not so much that the film is in 3D (sometimes you don't even notice it is and this kind of technology has clearly a long way to go still) but more the fact that Cameron imagined a pretty cool world. Pandora has some beautiful landscapes (computer-generated obviously) and you can tell that a lot of work was invested in the visual aspect of the film. The avatars were also very well done and if you look closely, you'll see the resemblance to the actors.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Avatar is very weak story-wise. The plot is a melange of age-old stories. It's very simplistic, childish even and has been done countless times: assimilation of an individual into a new culture, a cross-culture love story, heroic uprising against oppressors. The dialog is not that great either and on top of that there's a few plot holes and inconsistencies and the film is overlong. The monumental battle scenes and the grandiose music give an epic feeling to the film but the thin plot is impossible to overlook and really drags the film down. Sam Worthington was pretty good as Jake Sully and he has proved once again that he is leading man material. On the other hand, the praise Zoe Saldana has received for her performance is puzzling. The actress doesn't have any screen time. She only borrows her voice (and some of her movements were captured) to a character and I don't quite understand how that can be considered a great performance. Sigourney Weaver, the most experienced actress of the cast was actually disappointing.<br/><br/>Overall, Avatar is not a bad film, the problem is the plot plays second to the visuals. The film was extremely over-hyped and while it might be impressive on a technical level, it's not a great film by any means let alone a masterpiece or the next step in entertainment.<br/><br/>6/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I won't waste your time repeating what everyone is saying about the technical aspects of this film. It's a huge technical leap for the industry and for the art of cinema too. But that's not all, it does have added value, and I disagree with most of the charges about the unoriginal story. I think it borrows from other films/stories so the viewers can get it's point using the analogies. I can't elaborate without adding spoilers, so you'll simply have to trust me. If you saw the film and you think I'm wrong I'm willing to carry the argument further using the available channels. But I have two complaints: a)not enough humor (some minor scenes with some visual gags don't count). And more importent, b) most of the characters lack character, I understand that the two major \"baddies\" are cartoons in nature but there's no excuse for the complete absence of personality of most of the \"good\" humans in the film. It's a real shame because the film came real close to perfection and a little more attention could've brought it all the way there.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">There is nothing that has not been said with regards to the return of the king. After twelve years out in the 'wilderness' directing deep sea documentaries such as Ghosts Of The Abyss (2003) and Aliens Of The Deep (2005), and pushing the envelope on CG, 3-D, and motion-capture animation technology, James \"I am king of the world!\" Cameron is back to epic feature filmmaking with Avatar, a science-fiction extravaganza of sight and sound that is the brainchild of one of the world's most technically accomplished filmmakers of the last three decades with an envious filmography that reads The Terminator (1984), Aliens (1986), The Abyss (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), True Lies (1994), and Titanic (1997).<br/><br/>Directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by Cameron, Avatar comes with enormous pressure to deliver. With a budget ranging anywhere from US$250M to US$500M (let's not play the guessing game), it is the most expensive film to date. If there is one filmmaker in the world who can fully justify the use of such an obscene amount of greenbacks, it is Cameron. Every single dollar is put up there on the big screen.<br/><br/>Avatar is a simple story of war versus peace, human versus alien, a modern species versus an indigenous tribe. It draws influences from numerous films (apart from Cameron's own), most notably Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves (1990), Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai (2003), and Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke (1997) and Castle In The Sky (1986).<br/><br/>Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) plays a paraplegic ex-marine who replaces his dead brother by using his custom-made avatar, mind-controlling a three-meter tall alien with blue skin and identifiable human features to blend in with the Na'vi, the indigenous tribe of Pandora, a world of stunning natural beauty. The humans or Sky People as unaffectionately called by the Na'vi is hell bent on clearing the forests of Pandora to excavate rocks potentially worth many times more than Avatar's film budget. Sully finds love in Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), the gorgeous but fearless Na'vi daughter of a tribe head. She slowly warms up to his peaceful intentions, teaching him the ways of her culture. Torn between his race and the Na'vi, Jake must decide on his own destiny.<br/><br/>Avatar is an entirely original concept pieced together by elements borrowed heavily from other films. The result is a narrative that is fresh but predictable. Many will be familiar with such a story but it is the experience that counts. Cameron delivers a tremendously captivating film experience for all of its 160 minutes. Because there is an emotional core formed by the relationship between Jake and Neytiri, the visuals never take center stage. In fact, they only enhance our appreciation of Pandora and our connection toward the Na'vi. There is something at stake here. Who lives and dies matters unlike in Michael Bay's Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen (2009) or Roland Emmerich's 2012 (2009).<br/><br/>Avatar features an outstanding score by James Horner that deserves to be nominated for an Oscar. He captures the magic of Pandora and the thrilling spectacle by alternating between an enchanting soundscape and soaring themes. Speaking of Oscars, Avatar will win, hands down, the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and is likely to be nominated in other technical areas such as sound and cinematography. The big question is will Avatar be a Best Picture nominee? And will James Cameron receive his second directing nomination? The major problem I (as a die-hard Cameron fan) have with Avatar is the film's lack of significant action suspense. Cameron has a reputation for delivering white-knuckle excitement as characterized in films such as Aliens and T2, but this element is sorely lacking here. Because for most parts Avatar is rendered with CGI, the action sequences seem 'fake' despite being photorealistic.<br/><br/>There was a time when Cameron made gritty, realistic, balls-to-the-wall action set-pieces. That time has passed. I still admire Avatar as a film experience. But having said that, I feel this is Cameron's weakest work after True Lies. He retains his crown, but only a CG one.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Where to start. First off it's not as bad as some people say nor is it anywhere near as good as the hype. Basically it's a tired old story and a very unoriginal telling of it to make possibly THE most over rated movie of all time. The plot if you can call it that revolves around a planet populated by hippie smurfs armed with bows and arrows who live in a rather large tree and love everything who find themselves in conflict with evil alien invaders (or Americans as the rest of us know them) who have taken a fancy to a mineral called SpongeBobanium.<br/><br/>Now SpongeBobanium does not seem to actually do anything (because nobody mentions why it's so valuable) but does looks real cool when placed in an ashtray and used for a paperweight and is coveted by said alien invaders who have done all they can to ridicule silly native beliefs and undermine Smurfs way of life by teaching them English and importing Starbucks,Rustyburger and probably baby Jesus to no avail so have decided that killing everyone would be easier so to that end infiltrate a wheelchair bound ex marine to spy on them disguised as a 10 ft smurf. Sadly for alien invaders ex marine goes native almost instantly and falls in love with smurfette princess then proceeds to teach peace loving smurfs how to kick ass by virtue of being the chosen one as ordained by some seeds from a tree. Cue lots of learning about the power of the planet and some soul searching from evil aliens as to whether they are right to do so prior to unleashing a high tech hell onto the peace loving smurfs big tree home which leads to the big fightback scene and ultimate victory for the smurfs. So many tales have been ripped off here that the list would stretch from here to Tokyo. Needless to say very few have been told as dull as this one. Visually it is pretty neat but nowhere near the level that has been drooled over. The landscapes never look real and were better as Yes and Uriah Heep covers in the 70s and I do not believe anyone thought for a second that the smurfs look anything other than CGI generated PC game characters. Obviously JC has gathered all those game designers who worked on C&amp;C and Alien predator as well as a few disgruntled ex Jurrasic park folks but his flora and fauna look as fake as they do in .......fill in the name of your fave PC shooter....... Fun but daft and certainly not worth the million Oscars it is up for. In the same way Titanic was over rated garbage this falls into the same category. Perhaps it has advanced film making a tad or two but even the shiny-shiny of the CGI cannot eclipse the fact the acting is poor and the script drivel. Overlong and ultimately a bit tired and old hat.<br/><br/>The obvious Avatar 2 will be. Jake looks up at the sky lovingly and says to princess smurf. 'look a beautiful shooting star' when suddenly several thousand neutron bombs explode around him killing everything in an instant. Wait a few months for rads to die down then evil aliens come back and mine the cr#p out of smurf planet and take SpongeBobanium back home because smurfs big mistake was not realising we are even more evil then they could possibly imagine. And probably only wanted SpongeBobanium because they had it and we didn't. Earth 1 Smurfs 0......makes you proud to be human! :)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Why write another review of this film that will get lost amongst the hundreds of other reviews out there ? ... Why not ;-) I'll skip the usual movie recap which you've no doubt already read to focus more on the impressions and emotions I felt during the screening. It's amazing how the graphics in Avatar look so state-of-the-art despite the film being in production for so very long and all the incredible advances made during the past decade. I saw it in Imax 3d which is the best way to go for experiencing it as it was intended to be. Avatar was a grand spectacle that made me smile throughout not because it was funny but because of how wondrous it was. Yes, I felt a sense of awe and wonder which is something I rarely experience anymore. That Pandora planet, its fauna and flora, was breathtaking in its splendor and variety. Certainly, you could associate most of the alien creatures with an earthly equivalent but they still looked great and original anyway.<br/><br/>The main indigenous species, the giant blue humanoid Na'vi, could have been the deal breaker. From previews, it was said they looked and moved too much like video game characters. I understand yet disagree with that criticism but I admit I had to get used to them myself. However, they are indeed fascinating to watch and they do emote very well. They are believable and a technical marvel. An unforeseen bonus is that they're quite good-looking in their tall graceful cat-like ways and that the females are mostly topless although the nipples are almost always artfully blurred or concealed. There are scenes and cinematic angles in Avatar that could not have been done in the past without that level of computer graphics. They are seamless in execution, blending the real and the virtual. It's not enough to be able to do them, you have to do them well and Cameron excels. His camera work is bold and exciting. I particularly appreciated the sequences that made you feel as if you were really part of the environment or a character in the scene. <br/><br/>This brings me to the 3d effects. I think they intentionally tried to avoid cheap tricks such as having spears poke at you or creatures trying to bite your head off, breaking the fourth wall so to speak. They can be surprising but those usually take you out of the picture. The 3d effects here are mostly used to give depth to the environments, again trying to make you feel part of the scene. I think they worked amazingly well and it's probably the best use of 3d effects in a motion feature I've seen yet. The colors didn't feel faded or washed-out as in previous 3d efforts. Quite the contrary in fact, the colors were bright and luxuriant although I cannot compare with the 2d version.<br/><br/>I found the action scenes quite exciting, even exhilarating especially the flying scenes. The battles were tense, easily followable with none of the usual closed-in shaky camera crap. I sometimes feared for the fate of certain characters as they were put in danger or were about to do something particularly foolhardy and/or heroic. However, I had difficulty caring for them as well. I don't know if it's because the secondary characters were not developed enough, because of computer graphics or something else. The movie is long but the storyline, with its strong ecological overtones and white people vs native people metaphors, kept my interest. The above average acting did not distract from the proceedings and I particularly enjoyed Sigourney Weaver and the security chief. Some criticized the dialogue but I must say that despite its seeming lack of originality, it does the job and I for one liked the similarities to stuff we've heard from certain authorities to justify their controversial actions. The music was pretty awesome and fit the scenes rather well but none of the themes struck me as being memorable (a la John Williams). No cheesy songs until the ending generic at least. <br/><br/>I would not have minded spending even more time immersed in this alien world. Avatar isn't just about being spectacular, it does try to be about something and that makes it more special, no matter how unsubtle the message might be. With luck, it will indeed be a great success and will influence in a positive way the kids watching it. Will Avatar become a cult phenomenon like Star Wars in its time? I find it unlikely but it's too soon to tell. One thing for certain though, love it or hate it, Avatar is a benchmark and many future sci-fi films will be compared to it. I would like to watch it again in the theatres but I do wonder how it will hold up on a smaller screen down the line. As it is, I suggest seeing it in the best theatre you can find while you still can. Try not to get your expectations too high (it's not the second coming) and try not to focus too much on finding shortcomings with the Na'vi like I did (they're pretty great) <br/><br/>Rating: 8.5 out of 10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Awful, awful waste of money and time. Hackneyed, cliché-ridden, and 3-D so what! Admittedly a strange nexus of events in my life did not help viewing. Within the last three weeks I have been to Orlando, and the 3-D in 'Avatar' cannot compare with the 'Simpson's Simulator Ride' for being 'in it.' When the natives fly vertically, we do not see it through their eyes - too many people would leave the cinema sick! I also caught the James Cameron-directed 'Terminator Experience' in 3-D. Guess what, twenty minutes of Cameron cinema worked, this does not. I am afraid the spectacle is pretty feeble, and I was not immersed in this Disney fairyland with its only a dozen or so creatures (money run out?). Now for plot and characterisation, or lack of, should I say! In the last few days I have watched 'Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee' - same story but it really happened - is Cameron paying the Sioux any royalties? Then last night I watched 'King Arthur' - a lanky female archer with little bre**ts painted in blue leading an attack of blueies on the bad guys - is Cameron paying Keira Knightley any royalties? And as for rip offs from Steven Spielberg and 'Jurassic Park' and Kevin Costner and 'Dances With Wolves' - well, we'd better not get started. Supposedly a sci-fi film, there are huge mechanical robocops, but the hero has to put up with a 1960s' wheelchair, while full body DNA replicants of an alien species can be produced, but the private contractor army has to make do (in 2154 AD) with 1990s' bullets, grenades and high explosive (money run out for lasers, James?)!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No, this has to be one of the worst, most underwhelming movies of all time. Music - would you believe I came out of the cinema humming 'Titanic?' Well done, Mr Horner! And to cap it all, when I got home 'Destination Moon' made in 1950 for peanuts was on TV - in five minutes showing take off from Earth, there was more realism and emotion than all of 'Avatar.' But I have given it 1. Why? Because James Cameron has persuaded his countrymen to spend a quarter of a billion dollars to make it, and hundreds of thousands of Americans to watch what is basically a straightforward condemnation of the USA's past 'push west' and present arrogant imperialism in Iraq and Afghanistan. Can't all be bad, can it?!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Many critics who have reviewed \"Avatar\" said that they initially didn't know what to expect going in. I bring this point up because I felt the exact same way. I'd seen posters for the movie, and previews for it in the previous months before it was released, but did not know what it was about, let alone if I would like it or not. In fact, I was so unsure how I would feel about it that I saw \"Sherlock Holmes\" before I saw \"Avatar\". All I knew about the movie was that it was about blue, cat-like creatures, and it was directed by James Cameron, a guy who is very easy to dislike as a person. After all, \"Titanic\" broke many records, but eventually came to be seen as bombastic and meretricious. Cameron's declaring himself \"king of the world\" at the Oscars didn't help much, nor did his immediate public divorce from Linda Hamilton, or his long stretch of not directing a followup feature film (save the forgotten \"Ghosts of a Abyss\" (2003) that should have been called \"The Making of Titanic\", and \"Aliens of the Deep\" (2005)).<br/><br/>However, after seeing \"Avatar\", I can honestly say that there was not one inch of celluloid that was wasted in this film. Cameron may not be a nice guy, but when he wants to tell a story, he can tell it and not waste a dollar of his $250 million budget. As I serve myself a piece of humble pie, I'll even add that he probably does not care what an amateur, unestablished 27- year-old film critic thinks about him, and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>I went to see \"Avatar\" in 3D (which is well worth the extra 3 bucks, depending on the movie), and I was afraid to blink in case I missed something. This is an epic movie well-deserving of the term \"epic\". Any time there is a scene where a helicopter is flying out into the Pandora wilderness, or even inside in the scientific lab or Marine base, I was taken aback by the design and the detail of everything I saw on screen. Nowadays, saying that a movie has great special effects is synonymous with explosions and societal destruction compromising the majority of the film. \"Avatar\" indeed has great special effects, and those latter elements represent a small percentage of the film.<br/><br/>Naturally, like \"Titanic\", many people I spoke to had problems with the acting and the story line. One person I know called the movie \"'Dances With Wolves' In Space\", which I suppose it was. I also saw similarities to \"Ferngully: The Last Rainforest\" (1992) and \"Pocahontas\" (1995), but by no means was the story a blatant ripoff of any of these films. I did think the villainous characters like Colonal Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and Parker Selfrige (Giovanni Ribisi) made the Native American allegory too obvious by frequently calling the Na'vi creatures \"savages\". It made their characters also seem one-dimensional, and they obviously hadn't been taught about the Battle of Little Bighorn in school.<br/><br/>Other than that, I thought the acting was fine. Except for a few times his British accent slipped through, Sam Worthington had both a commanding presence throughout the film while also being a convincing moral compass. There haven't been many actors who can pull that off while playing a paraplegic. Sigourney Weaver, being no alien when it comes to science fiction roles, also did a great job here. And Joel David Moore was perhaps the breakout star of this film, doing a great acting job that truly redeems his role in \"The Hottie and the Nottie\" (2008). Lang's role as the hard-ass colonel may have been seen in other movies before, but there is no doubt that Lang knows how to play a great bad guy.<br/><br/>Zoe Saldana, Wes Studi, and CCH Pounder essentially did voice-over work in their roles here as the native Na'vi of the planet Pandora. Still, there was not one second where their voices were not convincing. Saldana especially cemented her position as a convincing leading actress while not appearing as a human on the screen at all. I don't have to say that she deserves to be an A-lister. She will be very soon if she isn't considered one already.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" deserves no less than 9 stars in my book. I usually give 10 stars to movies that are not only great, but really move me in some way. \"Avatar\" had a few weaknesses, but not enough to deduct a star from my rating. It was an enjoyable film that moved me on more than one level. I felt compassion for the characters, marveled at the scenery and special effects, and most importantly, didn't get up to go to the bathroom once during the film. When I went to see \"Titanic\" 12 years ago, on the other hand, I got up three times to go.<br/><br/>James Cameron wisely made the reported $237 million it took to make \"Avatar\" worth every penny. Fortunately, I wisely made the $14.50 I paid to see it in 3D worth every penny as well.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar was born from an idea by director James Cameron in 1999, with an idea to advance that genre called science fiction, with special effects, according to him, never seen before.<br/><br/>First of all, the world of Pandora is absolutely amazing. Every plant, animal and environment is incredibly imaginative. James Cameron familiarizes and gives a new focus on it to create an incredible totally realistic world feeling. It is quite evident that his deep exploration of the sea during the last years had a huge influence on the world of Pandora. Plants look and act like coral, creatures float in the air, like jellyfish, and everything is bioluminescent. It's visually stunning and makes you think that you could possibly be there in space waiting to be discovered on another planet. Many people complain about excessive use of CGI, but this is a case in which it is done well. Soon you will find yourself immersed in a world that forgets that everything is digital. I remember a scene where Jake (the protagonist) dives into a river to escape a creature that is chasing him. I thought, \"Looks like it would have been filmed in South America,\" I realized. Every drop of water, every blade of grass, every ray of light, and everything on the screen was completely CGI.<br/><br/>Fully CGI characters is a very risky business. They can fail horribly (Jar Jar Binks) or work perfectly (Gollum). This is a case where he is working perfectly here. Even though the ships are 9 feet tall and blue, you quickly forget that you are seeing a very detailed drawing. Capture the facial expressions of the actors and actresses perfectly. This is especially the case of Zoe Saldana as Neytiri. When she is angry or nervous, she accurately captures her performance. They are incredibly expressive. On the side of the \"human\" performance, the cast is excellent overall. Sam Worthington really gets to shine like Jake Sully. It has the right combination of ingenuity, hardness and arrogance. While Zoe Saldana is completely CGI as Neytiri, she is no less impressive in her performance as mentioned above. Sigourney Weaver is always one of my favorites, and is great playing her character Grace. The other outstanding performance within the cast is that of Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch. The only thing that can be blamed on Avatar is that the story is a little predictable and some dialogues are kind of corny, but it deserves to be seen.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is a decent but flawed sci-fi action adventure epic from writer/director Jameson Cameron who's admirable in giving audiences amazing state of the art special effects but some flaws which I'll get into later weighed it down for me. Sam Worthington turns in a solid performance as Jake Sully a paraplegic marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission who becomes torn between following orders and protecting the world he feels is his home. His CGI counter part is involved in most of the action but Worthington does what his role requires I guess. Zoe Saldana is very impressive as Netyiri a beautiful alien warrior instantly drawn to Jake who can certainly kicks some serious ass when she wants to. We never see Saldana only her CGI counter part but she brings life to her role and leaves an impression. Well done. Sigourney Weaver is good as always as Dr. Grace Augustine a scientist studying the planet of Pandora in her limited screen time. Michelle Rodriguez does what she can with her small role as Trudy a tough female pilot who eventually helps Jake in his quest to save Pandora from their own people. The rest of the cast are okay but none of them are really developed because most of the focus is on Worthington and Saldana. The special effects are fantastic including the planet of Pandora with breathtaking landscapes, floating mountains that defy gravity, and amazing creatures of all sizes but spectacle alone doesn't make a movie. Now that I've mentioned the good things about Avatar I'll touch on what I didn't like about it. I thought the story itself was very predictable right when Jake meets Neytiri I knew exactly what will happen next and how it was going to end. The dialog wasn't the greatest at times either. I felt Stephen Lang wasn't that great as the gung-ho Colonel Quaritch. I mean he gets attacked once by the the Na'Vi and all of a sudden he's hell bent on eliminating them off their own planet. I'm not sure if was really Lang's performance or the poor dialog he had to work with like \"Let's boogie\", \"Shut your pie hole\", and \"We fight terror with terror\" to a name a few because to me he simply wasn't the best villain. However I was glad to see that his character finally gets whats coming to him. The same can go for Giovanni Ribisi who is a talented actor but this isn't his best performance. No offense. His role amounts to only a handful of extended appearances playing greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge whose after a precious material that goes for 20 million a kilo. Ribisi like Lang do what their roles require I guess playing stereotypical one dimensional characters but they were just jerks all the way through who felt no remorse for the crimes they were committing against the Na'vi. If their characters were developed more and had better lines they could've been memorable villains instead of making them feel like after thoughts. The pacing of the movie was slow at times making the 162 minutes drag and there wasn't as much action as I thought there would be because most of it is in the third act but it's well executed none the less. I was frankly a little disappointed with Avatar and it wasn't the classic many people are making it out to be. Don't get me wrong it's not the worst movie I've ever seen but I'm just not sure why a lot of people out there are hailing it as a masterpiece. Yeah the special effects makes it worth watching at least once but I thought it was going to be better. I read somewhere about Dark Knight fans and Avatar fans arguing which one they think is better. I for one enjoyed the Dark Knight a lot more and that one is 153 minutes but it moved at a much faster pace. No movie has been able to match it yet. Avatar isn't that bad of a film it just has some flaws that weigh it down. Overall Avatar has great special effects, action, a little humor, and good performances from the cast for the most part (especially from Saldana and Worthington) but it isn't the best movie I've ever seen. If you're a big fan of Cameron you may enjoy it more than I did after watching Avatar though I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Rarely have I seen a more nauseatingly bad movie than James Cameron's Titanic. It lingers within your stomach like a bad oyster, but longer. On the other hand, Avatar lingers with you like a good movie should, leaving a deep impression on your spirit.<br/><br/>The CGI are used effectively and enjoyably, but most importantly, in a way that enhances the story, and not just for the sake of sensationalism.<br/><br/>However, it is worth asking how good this movie would be without CGI? The script is good but not great, the acting good but not great. So it would probably rate a 6. What you have, in essence, is a Western, a cowboys and Indians type story, but with the Indians as the good guys, much like Dances with Wolves. It is these black and white characterizations that are the weakness of Avatar.<br/><br/>But the CGI, alone, rates a solid 10. The effects in the movie are impeccable. One review claimed the 3D disappeared at points, but I think that was probably due to theater equipment malfunction.<br/><br/>Some guests on NPR tried to accuse the movie of racism, with the blue people as stand ins for Blacks. Huh? That's absurd. Too bad the host had not seen the movie. The bad guys, mainly the general and the corporate flunky, are white. If only they had been portrayed with at least a slightly troubled conscience they would have had more believability.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the movie does have characters whose consciences bother them, so it doesn't turn into a comic book, like Titanic. There is character development in both the humans and those blue people, the Navi. There is also a sufficiently complex plot to save it from the level of Titanic. And then there is Sigourney Weaver, a fine actress, who gives the otherwise schmaltzy movie bite.<br/><br/>From what I have heard of the technical complexity of making this movie, the actors deserve credit for doing such a good job in the face of such artificial conditions. I couldn't have done it. These are not big names, yet they generally did solid work.<br/><br/>One thing this movie has in common with Titanic is the way over the top gushing from many reviewers, too many. Frankly, there must have been a significant amount of paid buzz surrounding Titanic, and I think we are seeing it again with Avatar. This is standard PR operating procedure, going back at least to the Beatles, who had PR people who paid teenage girls to faint whenever they heard them play, to be taken to ambulances also on the PR payroll. (And then there are online reviewers who seem to hate Cameron with a vengeance.)<br/><br/>When Titanic was finally released, I think the press reviewers felt pressured not to pan such an expensive, pre-hyped movie. In retrospect, the reviewers were too kind to that turkey. But this time, I think they are actually a bit too critical, perhaps to make up for Titanic, and perhaps knowing a critical review will do little damage at the box office. While Avatar will never be listed alongside of Casablanca or Citizen Kane for its script, it will be a movie that will be remembered and watched for years to come.<br/><br/>So, bottom line, this is a movie you MUST watch in a movie theater because of the 3D, so go when you can see it in a theater with really good equipment. (Not all showings are in 3D, though. I don't think it is worth bothering seeing in 2D.)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar (2009)<br/><br/>Top 5 - 2009 <br/><br/>The comparisons to 'Star Wars' and the thematic parallels to 'Dances With Wolves' the Oscar winning masterpiece set in the plains of America, (where a Lieutenant in the Civil War era, befriends the native American people and rebels against the savage operations of the Army) are well founded. In 'Avatar' it is 2154, the Earth has been ravaged and exploited for its resources, so we take our military might to the planet of Pandora to extract resources at any cost necessary in order to profit back at Earth. The film centres around Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) a paraplegic ex-marine, whose mind is transplanted into a 9 foot Avatar of a Na'vi, in order to blend in the environment of Pandora and with the natives and obtain information for the huge American corporation about a worthy mineral called 'unobtainium' (no marks for originality there) which can be sold for millions/kg back on Earth. However Jake discovers the wonderful balance of the ecosystem in Pandora, the respect of the natives for nature and the energy transfer systems which enhance the natives' lives as they interact and respect their environs. Jake as Lieutenant Dunbar in 'Dances With Wolves' rebels. He sees too precious a thing to destroy. <br/><br/>The ecological message of 'Avatar' which relates to our current ravaging of our planet which is tipping the balances of nature and the aggressive imperialism of the USA, reflected by two current wars is reflected in the outlook of the film. The film, as noted by many critics is standard in its screenplay layout, character deployment and predictability, however Cameron still manages to pack an intense and thoroughly entertaining experience for over 160 minutes. The film even works emotionally at times, which some may find surprising. Any flaws in certain areas of the film are recovered by its breathtaking visual quality, which for once elevates the film instead of spoiling it. Amidst a blitz of annual brainless blockbusters, most notably Transformers 2 (which was outrageously bad), Avatar has its place somewhere along the Star Wars Saga and Jurassic Park in its first rate blockbuster quality. Cameron is a master of blockbusters.<br/><br/>With the Academy widening the Best Picture nominations to 10 this year, Avatar is certain to secure a nomination, along with Director, Visual Effects, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Original Score, Original Song and very possibly other categories. This year has been on average a poor year for film (despite glories at the Box Office) and it would not surprise me if 'Avatar' swept across all categories. After all the Academy has traditionally had a soft spot for massive scale, epic productions (from Gone With the Wind and Ben Hur to Gladiator), so I would not be too surprised if Avatar wins Best Picture. It would be a great thing for a science fiction film to get major critical recognition by the way of awards, because many sci-fi masterpieces have been unjustly ignored, most notably 2001: A Space Odyssey which should have swept the 1968 Oscars.<br/><br/>Cameron now has the 2 top box office juggernauts (unadjusted for inflation) and I think we might see a couple more Avatar films. The problem is, how do you top this one? How can you make it better without spoiling it? Well, I'll leave that to James Cameron.<br/><br/>8/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The ground shook, and the crowd cheered. They wept. They gasped. They laughed. And finally, they applauded. What they experienced was something only a master can make, an adventure so spellbinding, so memorable, and so exhilarating that it's worth holding your bladder for almost 3 hours to sit through. It's worth tearing up behind 3D glasses. It's worth admitting that to your friends later. Finally, it's worth telling people that you saw this movie. I'm lucky to say I was a part of that group.<br/><br/>Can anyone possibly set the bar higher than James Cameron? I think the only one who can set the bar higher is Cameron himself. He described it as his masterpiece, and that it is. Make no mistake: when seeing Avatar, know that you're witnessing cinematic history. Something directors like Peter Jackson only flirted with, Cameron mastered. Not only is Cameron's creation of a character astounding, but what truly sets Cameron apart from the rest is his ability to create a whole new world, where you can escape to, learn from, and bond to. At first, you'll be asking a lot of questions. \"Who's he?\", \"What was that?!\", \"Is that real, or CGI?\". But soon after...I can't say at what point, because I imagine it being different for each viewer, you'll become immersed in Cameron's beautiful Pandora, as he opens the box and reveals a beautiful new world to us as viewers.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of Visual Effects, in my opinion. The first kind is the \"Transformers\" kind. These effects are the kind that wow you with their showy exterior, but are just there for entertainment. The second kind is the kind that enhances the background, works within a setting, and improves the overall viewing experience. Cameron did it with Aliens. He did it with Terminator 2. He did it for Titanic. And now he's done it again. At this point, he's just showing off. Cameron's incredible immersion into the world of Pandora is what makes it work. Without it, this is just some other alien movie. Cameron's impeccable attention to detail, such as whenever our characters are roaming through a forest, or flying on a winged beast...this is what gives the movie its life, its energy...which is what the entire theme and point of the movie is. Life is connected through us all, and Cameron's incredible work will bond every viewer through their love of movies and the very escapism Cameron provides.<br/><br/>You'll notice that I've spared you a plot description. I believe this movie is best viewed with little or no knowledge. It helps with the immersion. Don't watch a trailer. Don't read a synopsis. I will say, however, that the true stars of the film are Zoe Saldana and Stephen Lang, who will undoubtedly go down as two actors who played their classic-in-the-making characters to perfection. Yeah, the screenplay is not a truly original product, and the film does play out in a semi-formulaic fashion...but this doesn't matter. It's the experience of Avatar that will move you, by what you're seeing, what you're hearing...and what you're experiencing. A beautiful score makes this seamlessly edited film flow even better, while the colors of the movie, so bright and vibrant, assure the viewer that they're about to have the most unique movie-going experience of their lives.<br/><br/>I can't really recommend an experience like this more than I already have. I was on another planet for almost 3 hours. This is truly a movie to experience, a movie that makes us glad that we live in these times. It's the best motion picture of 2009, and one of the most revolutionary, immersing, and incredible movies ever made. I can say this without a doubt. Do not miss this.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Before Titanic was released, Cameron had the idea to do Avatar, but no studio would do the film because of the huge budget and Cameron doubted the special effects ability to show Hometree properly.<br/><br/>However, more than a decade after Titanic, Cameron finally got Avatar done. This is not a tremendous film, because it is merely a special effects movie that takes away from what could have been an original imaginative story.<br/><br/>Plus, I wasn't very much in favor of Sam Worthington being the lead actor. I enjoyed him as Marcus in Terminator 4, but I felt he was wooden and basically could have phoned in his performance with this movie. He seems like he's just reading his lines and not really a part of the film at any point.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most surprising thing in the movie is Zoe Saldana as Neytir, since I've seen her in a few movies as a supporting or lesser-used character, but she has a breakout performance here. She is very unrecognizable due to her being digitally changed to look like a Na'vi.<br/><br/>I was happy about Giovanni Ribisi being a villain-type in the film, but disappointed when he was barely on screen (as he's my favorite actor).<br/><br/>Acting aside, this film is nothing really amazing in terms of special effects. It's all been seen before, and it really just looks like a live-action movie of World of Warcraft. I did originally enjoy the movie, but on repeat viewings I grow to detest it more and more just because the special effects hogs the whole 160 minutes. It takes away from the story and makes me careless about it all.<br/><br/>I will probably only watch this movie due to someone else (a friend, girlfriend, etc.) asking me to watch it. However, I will not watch it on my own because I have no enjoyment watching it. I cannot wait for it to end.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">OK so just like many reviews on here have stated, it's clear the cgi is incredible but sadly the story is pretty disappointing, now the plot is to go to an alien planet &amp; mine for a substance called \"unobtanium\", well they should've just popped along to Delroy Lindo &amp; asked him for some, after all his character in \"the Core\" ( released in 2003) created \"unobtanium\" to build his earth boring ship.<br/><br/>Its pretty clear that the plot/story was way way down on the list of things to do, showing off the 15 years of R&amp;D of cgi was apparently more important.<br/><br/>More epic fail than epic movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I don't know how anyone can criticize this movie in terms of technology, let's give credit where credit is merited. Much detail is given thought in forests and creatures and the alien world and such. Though, really not that much in an original way, not really. More just a click and another click on a computer. And ripping off old movies about the west from the late 60's through the 90's. <br/><br/>Absent the technology (which will fade in it's impressiveness in time), the question is what quality of movie is it? <br/><br/>It's stupid. <br/><br/>In fact it's idiotic. Beyond so. Without question. <br/><br/>E.g. When has an arrow been able to penetrate a bullet proof vest? Not that I know of in the twenty first century, who knows about the other side of the planet, but, really? Or why does an ostensibly ruthless colonizing people (horrible humans) been unable to destroy a primitive culture for profit reason (one plot line in the movie). Reeks of Ewoks. <br/><br/>It's basically an old style American Indian movie. Very much the same as \"Dances with Wolves\" with Kevin Costner. An Army guy (here being a Marine) meets natives and finds them to be one with nature and all that stuff. It's just dressed up here with cool special effects and very interesting conceptual context. <br/><br/>The context has mostly been done before. Flying lizard type things that are ridden like horses or birds for that matter. <br/><br/>The native folks who are seemingly at one with the earth -- see any movie about American Indians, obnoxious corporate guy in search of minerals... the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>The \"Dances with Wolves\" similarity is striking: Except the American Indians are blue, very tall, not very smart, look very much like cats; otherwise very similar in speak, attitude, and weird. Very little clothing, but also very little in way of understanding their culture. Much like modern American movies of the same sort (including, oddly, \"Dances with Wolves). <br/><br/>Upon reviewing, there are elements of other American movies, with American troops overseas (on Earth that is), as in Vietnam -- the war machines of the obviously American colonizers (or miners, or exploiters, or whatever particular one fancies in some political fantasy) are extremely similar, a century in the future or more, as they are in the 1960's in Vietnam, or the 1990's and 2000's in Iraq and Afghanistan. <br/><br/>There is a reminiscence of Apocalypse Now, but not the brilliance of that film, but in the end, (Spoiler -- spoiler -- this is not a PLOT spoiler but a CONCEPT spoiler) ... <br/><br/>... enjoying the defeat of American Marines is hard to understand by an alien species, especially in the first part of the 21st Century of this world. <br/><br/>The seemingly American military (in all but name) has technology of the future that isn't even close to the technology of today, and one might suspect if there is technology to move to another planet, it might improve or at least stay the same. Not so here. The battle between the \"people\" of the indigenous planet and the military of the \"Sky People\") is laughable. <br/><br/>The movie is a simple one, not really much original.<br/><br/>I won't give away spoilers, except to say, \"you've got to be kidding\" me moments.\" So ridiculous as to merit not just an eye roll but a wretch.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">With the recent announcement that James Cameron's Avatar lost its box office top spot to Purple Shrek, I figured I'm done holding back when it comes to my thoughts on the 2009 spectacle that started everything. The sci-fi that set the record straight. The film that was gonna prove how awesomely awesome CGI, motion-capture and 3D could be in movies, all whilst providing us with the most cliché-ridden, been-done storyline you could feasibly think up (given that thinking is even necessary). So much for \"groundbreaking\".<br/><br/>On top having already been berated by many for what an unoriginal story it tells, I don't know that Avatar did much to convince anyone that seeing films in 3D is an improvement (Life of Pi being an exception that comes to mind). What Cameron did get right was that it's a big step in terms of mo-cap and visual effects, but things like that are usually only cool when the movie comes out. Indeed, Avatar was quickly upstaged and today we can go see films even more gorgeous like The Lion King (I didn't necessarily say they're all good).<br/><br/>More on that in a bit. Before we proceed, let's discuss the premise of it all. In the year 2154, an interplanetary mining expedition reaches the faraway world of Pandora. Its crew includes crippled ex-Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the remorseless Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), sassy scientist Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and also Michelle Rodriguez as herself. Their mission to this vigorous forest moon is to harvest a rare mineral known as \"unobtanium\" - as in, that is the word they un-ironically use to describe it in-universe. Just so we're clear.<br/><br/>First, the humans must infiltrate the natives of Pandora, a race of blue feline-humanoids known as Na'vi, which they aim to do by using so-called \"avatars\" that look exactly like Na'vi and can carry the consciousness of humans. Jake Sully happens to be one of the volunteers (his dead twin to be exact, but let's keep it simple) and he certainly gets to do more walking in his avatar host body.<br/><br/>The Na'vi are very much in tune with the nature of Pandora and as you surely know already, Sully comes to like them once he gets close enough. One of them, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) he likes a little extra. It basically escalates to a point where Sully sides with the Na'vi and their natural ways against the evil humans and their greedy ways, resulting in a climax where a military force consisting of advanced spacecraft and mech suits gets trounced by blue jungle people with arrows and sticks. Is the message clear enough yet? You're supposed to root for the faction that likes trees, guys (no pun intended).<br/><br/>Essentially, we get all the story beats of Pocahontas, Atlantis, The Last Samurai, Dances with Wolves and Ferngully accompanied by flying scenes that looked better in How to Train Your Dragon. As all these things transpire, Cameron attempts to distract the viewer with an epical and exuberant alien world (which in itself looks somewhat derivative of the old Valérian and Laureline comics with its levitating mountains), brought to us entirely by the art of CGI. And sure enough, Pandora often does look amazing. The problem is this: we don't care, especially not to the extent that we're dying to see the same thing in four movies more.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, I'm not saying this just because I happen to think practical filmmaking typically makes for more engaging behind-the-scenes documentaries than digital (one of a million reasons The Abyss is a superior Cameron film). It's also because the film is so self-indulgent about its technical achievements and so gimmicky that the visual effects become its main star. It was probably like that for a long time too, explaining why the film's actual characters and plot feel like an afterthought, carelessly copy-pasted from the script of Dances with the Last Pocalantis or what-have-you. The entire point of the film was to show Sam Worthington turn into someone else via the latest leap in technology by having him play a character that turns into someone else via the latest leap in technology; it's literally a movie that's only about its own effects!<br/><br/>And no, none of this means I don't value new breakthroughs in cinematic science. But if that's the only thing your movie is going to be about, why not just make it a neat little short film to screen at SIGGRAPH? Why toss in a bunch of stolen plot elements and tired tropes to make it nearly 3 hours in length? You could easily make a heartwarming tale about a sad man with no legs getting his consciousness transferred to the body of a strange alien creature by revolutionary researchers, allowing him to play basketball with his friends and do incredible tasks! It would be over in five minutes and it would show a simple man getting to embody something more fantastic through progressive science - the perfect allegory for motion-capture technology! No overblown runtime, no on-the-nose environmental message, no ancient clichés, no recycled characters who develop abruptly, no corny dialogue, and no endless show-off shots of a CG'd alien realm that will look outdated next week; only a clever and to-the-point way of showcasing what we can do with computers now.<br/><br/>It doesn't really work when the rest of your movie is about how evil technology is (unless you interpret that the film advocates peace and symbiosis between the natural and civilized worlds), nor are you in an apt position to critique humanity for its corporate greed when you announce that there will soon exist five Avatar movies in the world, only because one made billions and so therefore must be great. Another reason Jim's making so many sequels, reportedly, is to spite those who didn't like this one. That's our Cameron, letting his ego run rampant at the expense of his self-analysis and his not-being-a-child. Have you ever been mistaken for a man, James?<br/><br/>The error is that he gets too much of a free pass, usually for just making movies that \"look nice\". Avatar is severely overrated by the common moviegoer and his Titanic might be too, yet that was still a good film that had more to offer than the graphics of its cruise ship. In any case, Cameron will always have those who worship him and thus encourage him to do as he pleases. I for one worship his younger self; the man who directed The Abyss, one of the most ambitious, technically impressive and gripping motion pictures I ever beheld.<br/><br/>I am utterly clueless as to what not one, but four sequels to this damned thing could possibly bring to the table. But if I were to guess, I think Cameron's probably going to make each new film relate to whatever's groundbreaking within the world of visual effects at the time of its release; then he can just slap the story of Beauty and the Beast and Dumbo on there so that it cracks 160 minutes. What a fun couple of years this will be.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron's \"AVATAR\" did an incredible job. It's an unforgettable journey on an alien planet called, 'Pandora'. The story is about a former Marine, taking his twin brother's place to the journey of the alien planet 'Pandora', then he came to learn and falls in love with a blue-skinned warrior named, Neytiri... and sides with her people against humankind's encroachment on their lush world. Now this is one of the best James Cameron's film of the year since \"Titanic\"</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The following review contains a spoiler <br/><br/>IMO,the CGI (computer generated imagery) was stunning and worth the price of admission. I loved the animals, and especially the plants and plant-like creatures floating through the air like luminescent small jelly-fish/dandelion seeds--as well as many other plants. The floating mountains, the vegetation, the flying creatures were excellent. The fear of heights it induced in viewers was breathtaking. <br/><br/>I got tired of wearing the 3D glasses and having my face slapped so hard, so continually with 3D effects. For ME, except for the novelty of seeing some of it that way, it would've been fine--even better--to see it in 2D.<br/><br/>The story line was both kind of interesting but by far it's weakest part; it felt like it primarily served as an excuse to serve up all the special effects.<br/><br/>For the story line, Cameron used elements from many historical explorations of the more technologically advanced \"civilized world\" taking, raping, the resources of aboriginal tribes--oft repeated, whether with the Incas, Aztecs, Caribbean islanders, American Indians, African cultures (e.g., the Congo), Pacific Islanders, wherever. His avatar characters even resembled (IMO) some facial features of North American Indians.<br/><br/>A key difference or variation: this time the aboriginals successfully resisted being exploited and drove the intruders out--albeit under the leadership of a defecting intruder and the help of a few of his like-minded compatriots.<br/><br/>Also, in quite significant ways, I thought Avatar echoed a great many of the themes, conflicts and outcomes in Miyazaki's animé film \"Princess Mononoke\"--except Cameron does with CGI what Miyazaki did with hand drawn art. (If you've never seen \"PM\" I highly recommend it; it's not my favorite Miyazaki but very worthwhile and a deserved favorite of many.) <br/><br/>Since avatar's are so very common in computer games, I do wonder if Cameron might be playing on computer gamers' fantasy desires to make the transition to their avatar and leave their worldly bodies and abilities behind? (I notice on IMDb's discussion forum, some people say they've seen the 3D version 12-16X!!!! -- I suspect these must all be computer gamers.) I also suspect that avid computer gamers will be almost universally those most delighted with \"Avatar\" while we others will be less so.<br/><br/>There were some plot holes.<br/><br/>The most bothersome to me was that whenever the hero, Jake, was back in HQ sleeping, eating, reporting, etc., his avatar body was unresponsive--functionally dead. Over 3 months? Every day for 90 days? Without causing suspicion or alarm to the native Na'vi people??? And it was announced that all the life forms on the planet--Na'vi, animals, plants--were in communion with each other in a symbiotic relationship but little was made of this. <br/><br/>The ultimate battle scene went on much longer (was it 2 hours? or 20 minutes? whatever) than I thought it deserved. How many war machines, how many explosions, collisions, how many Plexiglas windows and bodies do I need to see pierced, blown to smithereens, when I already have no doubt of who's going to win? Or was this some embedded promotional advertising for the coming release of \"Avatar: the Computer Game\" ??<br/><br/>Interesting CGI &amp; special effects = 10 stars <br/><br/>Story line, narrative, used as the vehicle to display said special effects = 5 stars</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I may have been the only person up until now to never have seen Avatar, not because I haven't had time but simply because, I just didn't feel it was necessary. I had loved James Cameron's earlier films (Terminator, Aliens and T2) and whilst True Lies was a good fun film, it was overlong. The same can be said about Titanic and it was by this point that I came to realize that James Cameron was one of the most overrated directors in the business. I can now say that Avatar joins his list of overrated films giving us nothing but visuals to drool at.<br/><br/>A group of marines are sent down to a planet called Pandora in search for some precious material and paraplegic Jake Sully is one of them since he becomes a replacement for his dead brother. Here, Jake begins to bond with the native Na'vis as he learns about their lifestyle and falls in love with Neytiri whilst failing to obey orders given to him.<br/><br/>Here is a premise that has been done before but the issue to Avatar arises with James Cameron and his overuse of CGI to dazzle his audiences. Since 2009, it has become absurd to think how people have truly fallen in love with this film hailing it as one of the greatest ever! This has always annoyed me but having seen the movie, this is absurd. If the visual effects to Avatar weren't as dazzling and there was no 3D to marvel at, then you have a movie that is absolutely nothing special. Whilst I am not criticizing the visuals, the story is so poorly told and the characters are stereotypical, with none of the characters coming off as interesting in the slightest. Even Neytiri, who we as an audience should be able to connect to, comes off as rather irritating. Whilst Cameron's earlier films, mainly the first two Terminator films and Aliens were able to convey emotion effortlessly making it very subtle and natural, Avatar truly overdoes it making many of the sequences involving the natives mourning rather laughable.<br/><br/>Though audiences have drooled about the visuals and the 3D effects, I myself saw no true brilliance about each whether it was due to the fact that I knew the overuse of CGI or whether it was the fact that I was able to concentrate on the story and characters. The film itself is paced quite poorly and inconsistently. The first hour drags along as Jake attempts to get in with the natives and the last hour and a half suddenly becomes a much livelier and more action packed feast than it was before. The problem with this is that the first half of the film doesn't provide much about Jake Sully to truly care for him and too much is given about Neytiri and her people that it comes to the point where it becomes rather difficult to take in anymore. This is overkill! Even with the poor story and attempt to overly humanize the Na'vi by providing possibly too much story, the action sequences towards the end of this film are truly engaging even if the characters in them aren't. It is mindless eye candy thrown onto the screen simply because Cameron knew that there was no way that the film would be received the same without a huge 'Helm's Deep' of his own. Whilst 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' had an engaging story, relatable characters, great character development, great performances, strong writing and directing that eventually deserves to be payed off with a huge action feast, Avatar rarely accomplishes any of the following I listed and so the huge action feast at the end is Cameron's way of attempting to erase his audience's mind of all the poor things about this film.<br/><br/>I am rather surprised to say this but most of the performances in the film come off as extremely poor when compared to Cameron's other films such as Aliens which had some of his better performances by actors. Sam Worthington isn't anything special as Jake Sully. I am still unsure on who to blame for not being able to like Jake. Sigourney Weaver, surprisingly, gives an extremely poor performance when compared with her performances in the Alien franchise. Most of the performances were extremely weird making the characters they played hard for me to take in seriously.<br/><br/>Those who simply praise the brilliant visuals and simply forget about the poor story and poor character development are those who do not truly think about this film and give it a simple pass for its revolutionary visuals. I just ask of them to view the film had the visuals not being at the standard that they were. As a young George Lucas once said, \"Visual effects are used to tell a story. Special effects without a story is a pretty boring thing!\" We all know what became of this man later in his life but this is a principle that James Cameron himself followed, until Avatar came along.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is the best movie I have ever seen.. ever. The Dark Knight can say goodbye. My favorite movie is Avatar, and just in time. 2009 is almost over. Nothing like Avatar to end the year. I was just about to feel very awful at the end under I saw the main character, who's name I still haven't really gotten (I think it's Jack) survive. He's still alive.<br/><br/>An alien world, similar to Earth's prehistoric times. The times of dinosaurs. Giant birds that you have never seen alive, and indegenous people that live their (unlike Earth had as far as we know.) We came there for a rock. Yep, a rock that sells for millions of dollars. If the indegenous don't leave, sucks for them, it's our land. We've created clones of the indegenous peoples that we put our Humans in, and Jack was one of them. He later realizes that we are very wrong, and will go against his race.<br/><br/>Nothing like the giant big army guy boss dying at the end to make this movie feel excellent. I really loved it. There's nothing more I can say, and I doubt that this review will be on the front, but this will really be your best movie, too.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's new movie \"Avatar\" is an outstanding film.<br/><br/>Each and every actor gave a solid performance that helped to enhance the film. Stephan Lang was absolutely brilliant in his role. The characterization was wonderful and the writing allowed you to identify with the characters and empathize with them. It is rare that a Sci-Fi movie has this range and depth of characterization included.<br/><br/>The story is the usual Sci-Fi/Fantasy story. Nothing in the main plot is much different from other movies that have tackled the same dilemmas.<br/><br/>The world is an absolute utopia for the senses. There has never been a movie with this much detail and fantastic effects with the landscape. Every plant, every stream, every inch of this planet is stunning and wonderfully filmed. The floating islands are stunning, the foliage, the life that the illumination brings to the plants, the colors, this world is beautiful in every aspect.<br/><br/>The indigenous life looks real and the creatures also have great character and essence.<br/><br/>Digital 3-D is a must to get the full experience. The 3-D makes you feel like you are looking out your window (or doorway) into this world. You see the insects flying around the characters and you feel like you could catch one of the fireflies, you feel the embers of the fire nearing you, you experience the depth perception of entering a room and looking at the characters within.<br/><br/>Avatar is a masterpiece in film-making. While the story is typical of Sci-Fi alien encounter movies and the acting is very good---the world is stunning, visually moving, a complete enjoyment for the senses, a visual fantasy and delight, an experience well worth any admission price. Avatar is the greatest visual/special effects movie ever made. I thoroughly recommend it to everyone. Sit back, take in the beauty of the environment, the thrill of the 3-D and the excitement of experiencing flight, riding, and fighting in 3-D.<br/><br/>WOW is the word you will use over and over and over throughout this entire movie.<br/><br/>Reading some of the other reviews, I am saddened by the nasty commentary that people have put in these forums. It is obviously not accurate about the film and made to discredit a visual utopia. Please do not listen to negative people. Whether you like the story or not---the visual are so amazing that you are engulfed in the beauty of the planet and it's life force. What Cameron has done is to elevate the level of film-making for the coming years and I applaud him for his efforts. Relax, take a deep breath and sit back and enjoy the spectacle.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I would like to ask a question: is there someone in the audience who witnessed the first coming of 3D in the sixties? I would really like to read some reactions from adults back then. <br/><br/>(Not just for the sake of comparisons, technological or others. I am not even sure if it is cultural the same way, cultural differences aside.)<br/><br/>It surely is sweeping. <br/><br/>It is mind-numbing in a way, or more ways if you will. <br/><br/>Yet the audience reacted in a strange way, I mean the audience from Athens, Greece, where I saw the film, 3D and all, and this is what I would like to share, since everybody will make his own experience on watching the film, and then will react to the reviews. <br/><br/>So, this is it: let's say that the film risks to get short-circuited into an allegory of a choice between the \"real\" and a virtual reality, with the hero switching between \"bodies\", like in a game, as some detractors would probably say. <br/><br/>My question was: when the point comes, for it was galloping towards us in the climax, will the hero choose his invalid body and thus validate his existence as a hero, or regress to the virtual realm and as such deliver us to the deadlock of a fantasy world? <br/><br/>Although this remains unresolved in a way at the end, even titillating us with the promise of a sequel, and here I go back to the bizarre reaction from the audience, are we sure we want to go to the end of our fantasy world? It surely is entertaining, but is it all the way?<br/><br/>When Neytiri saves Jake Sully from suffocation, and they, then, just before the end, meet for the first time \"as they really are\", the audience burst out laughing, as if this was gruesome and incongruous for the sake of the love story. As if everything else in the story could be awesome, or agenda-ridden, but not what happens between a male and a female, even though, well, they are of a different species. <br/><br/>It reminded me of a TV ad that appeared some years now - girl wanders in the woods, encounters a frog, kisses frog, frog becomes prince, prince looks somewhat dubiously girl, kisses girl, girl becomes beer, he drinks beer. You guessed it, the ad was for a beer. <br/><br/>So, the question I would like to pose is: what does a beer taste like on Pandora, is the gist of the film?<br/><br/>Please tell me.<br/><br/>Open my eyes.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I think i need to review this film again when i can relax and immerse in the experience. The showing i went to was spoiled by two brats who insisted on doing a running commentary during most of the picture which was a huge shame.That aside i really did get the feeling that James Cameron has achieved something major here. His use of technology never seems to get in the way of him making a good film like it does with the Emmerichs and Bays of this world. Cameron has proved that no-one does epic like him. He was almost born to be a popcorn director yet he is so much more at the same time. The story of Avatar is very simple and the plot has obvious comparisons to Dances With Wolves and more recently The Last Samurai. This would probably be more of a drag if the film itself wasn't such a visual knockout, yes, the film is alive, the visuals are truly stunning and the imagination that has gone in to creating this world and these surroundings is remarkable. The cast are all fine, Stephen Lang is fun the cartoonish baddie although it would have been better if we as an audience could have hated him a little more. Sam Worthington continues to grow and is OK as Jake. Sigourney Weaver is always a presence but here she is given a lot less to do than as Ripley in Aliens. In all, i thought Avatar was a resounding success in as much as its visual achievements. The only downside? Every two-bit director in Hollywood will now be making 3D films. A lot of them will be rubbish and few will pass the test in same way Avatar has.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It has been 12 years since James Cameron pulled in 11 Oscars with Titanic and now he returns with a sci-fi yarn that pops our eyes like no movie has ever done before. The visual effects are outstanding, not since Lord of the rings has a film shown as powerful of visuals as this. Not the most grappling story, but definitely the most grappling visuals and battle scenes, not once did I want to take my eyes off the silver screen. CGI is rarely better than this and is definitely worth appreciation. The message Director Cameron wanted to imply is that humans must learn to respect the resources more that we have. Cameron masterfully weaves that message into pure cinematic storytelling and turns out a hit!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This review is full of spoilers.<br/><br/>You've seen the story before. It's basically \"Pocahontas\" on some other planet - even with silly song numbers throughout the movie. You've seen the whole \"everything is connected to everything else\" deal, and glowing effects all around the characters - in the 80's, in \"Tron\". You've seen the battle between the natives against the evil empire - in \"Return of the Jedi\". You'll feel a bit ill when you realize you are looking at thousands of Jar Jar Binks on the screen all the time, just like in the prequels. And everything else - you'll just know Cameron simply stole it from \"The Matrix\" trilogy (right down to the \"plug-in\" sequences and the human-controlled robots). There's even a \"Tank\" character, but this time it's a female - and it's also from Latin America! You'll immediately know which characters live and which ones will die at the end. You won't have to guess twice at who the bad guy is. You'll know exactly what will happen and how it will all end.<br/><br/>You'll notice how poor the acting is (come on, the lead from \"The Hottie and the Nottie\" as a scientist?). You'll be bothered by jumps in continuity (\"where did that guy come from???\"). And you'll find out that James Cameron simply cannot edit a movie to its proper length, even if his life depended on it - you could cut 1 hour of this one and it wouldn't detract much from what it is.<br/><br/>And you'll have nightmares all over again about Celine Dion - when you listen to the songs on this one. It's \"Titanic\" music all over again. Same conductor, same style of music. The song at the end is a dead ringer for \"My heart will go on\". Ack.<br/><br/>Sure, the visuals are awesome - if you catch it on 3D. If you don't, well, you'll be bothered by things that you just know should be jumping out at you, but in 2D, they look like someone's afterthought.<br/><br/>6 stars, only because it looks awesome.

This is, without a doubt, one of the best looking films ever made, and I can't be proud of the work done here enough. The performances, too, are all fantastic, as everyone did really good in their role, and thanks to the great direction, this film does a good job in having a solid foundation. While all of this sounds well and good, the problems, unfortunately, rear their ugly head in, as the story, despite it being ambitious, becomes somewhat bland and predictable. I mean, once the story sets itself up, it's hard not to predict how the rest of the film may turn out. And for as well this film was directed, the film forgets to add reasons to really care for the characters, as thanks to the meh story, I can't really think of a single character besides the main ones, and this is even after watching it a few times. I just thought the story, as a whole, was boring, and a boring story makes it a guarantee that the characters in the said story won't stand out. All in all, this movie, at the end of the day, is just okay. It's beautiful and breathtaking in it's presentation and film making, sure, but the story telling and forgettable characters makes this film kind of dull. I enjoyed my time with it for the most part, but I hope for the sequel to be better, because this film, in retrospect, really isn't that great at the end of the day. Overall, this is a beautiful movie that fails to leave that big of an impact, because even for as well made as it is, is there really a point to watch this when there are other beautiful films that have better stories? Again, this film isn't bad. It's just not anything essential, unless you want to look at beautiful CGI that, to this films credit, still holds up pretty well.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This is one of the few movies that I have actually paid to see in a cinema more than twice, that for me says something about how good I think it is.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this move I sat in a row very close to the screen and it was in 3D. It blew me away. This was the cinema release which was 162 minutes long. It felt like 5 minutes and held my attention from start to finish. I came back the next day and sat through it again, this time a little further back and again in 3D. After about a 3 hour break for lunch and other activities I came back to the cinema and watched it again, this time in 2D. All three times the movie was 162 minutes long and each time it felt like no time at all. My immediate rating after each viewing was 8/10.<br/><br/>Months later this came out on Blu Ray with the extended cut available at 178 minutes. 16 whole extra minutes added, wow, so cool were my thoughts before watching it. After I had watched the extended cut the first time my immediate rating was 10/10, those 16 minutes for me changed the whole movie and made it so much better.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, Wes Studi and CCH Pounder, just a few of the name actors in this masterpiece and they all contribute and add to the experience of a great movie.<br/><br/>James Cameron hit the ball out of the park with this one as far as I am concerned. I loved Titanic, but this just goes to the next level. Probably the best movie I have ever had the privilege of watching many many times.<br/><br/>This movie has everything, action, romance, drama and comedy. Anyone who did not see the funny moments must not have watched the same movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't ever seen this movie yet, get the extended cut copy and view it, avoid any other copy, you will not be disappointed.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I saw this movie in 3D. I don't wear glasses, so it was a little bit weird to watch a movie with glasses on. Watching a movie in 3D is quite an experience. You can see the depth of the movie, but things do not come out of the screen, what some people say it does.<br/><br/>Now I'm not a fan of Worrington. In Terminator I did not like him and this movie did not change even one bit of it. Cameron thinks he is a handsome man, I don't know. But even Bollywood proves that when you only are pretty or handsome, you can make it in the movie industry. You don't have to possess the ability of acting. Worrington is a shallow actor, maybe suitable for an action movie, but not with a high budget like this one.<br/><br/>The movie itself is beautiful. You keep watching the screen seeing beautiful flowers, animals, a new world within a world. A discovery. Almost everything we get to see is a new experience, except the airplanes of the humans. They remind me of the airplanes of the last Terminator movie. The whole movie is a rush, and that's a good thing. As a viewer you don't get a chance to get bored in this 2.40 hours long movie.<br/><br/>Not only the animals and flowers are beautiful. Also the way the people on the new planet called Pandora are connected to animals or flowers is fantastic.<br/><br/>The story is simple, a little less interesting than Terminator. But this movie is not about the story, where they want to tell people that they are raping the earth and after that they want to find other planets as their victim. What is good about this idea is that it shows that people with high influence in business life don't always have to be the people who make the sanest or smartest choices. In real life I can relate to this aspect. You got to see this movie in 3D for a great experience.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This is a film (and a rare one) that just about anything you say about it, it's probably valid: good, bad, indifferent. I'm in the latter category. It's interesting that James Cameron abandons what made him a legend—storytelling in Titanic—and dumps just about any and everything from all the rest of his films combined in a 2.75 hour epic.<br/><br/>No denying, visually it's astonishing. And that's not entirely a compliment. I'm kind of a beige fellow, and the color scheme here tends towards the dayglo of a black light. I won't quibble about the choice. Cameron brought us those extraordinary photos of actual creatures from the Marianas Trench, and I guess their lack of color was something he wanted to work against. There are a few moments of delicacy and wonder from the planet Pandora, but otherwise, the camera is flying up and around and down and through the CGI scenery, and the thrill wore off (for me) about an hour into it.<br/><br/>Almost two hours left, and I was discouraged at how paltry the imagination was when the screenplay had to settle down and involve us. I saw one review that compares this experience to what audiences must have felt in 1933 when they saw King Kong. And I agree. But we cared what happened to those stuffed animatronic puppets, here I cared nothing for anyone on the screen. I think the problem is the Na'vi never came to life for me. Their movement was stilted and their, er, belief system was of such a silly New Age goofiness that the young fellow next to me couldn't stop giggling anytime some sort of nonsense was spouted. (I was always taught not to laugh at other people's beliefs, and maintained.) <br/><br/>The last hour is very difficult to sit through since, well, we are at war, and the script is not subtle in comparing the policies of the Bush Administration to the \"English\" army in this film. Watching what would be U.S. soldiers slaughtered isn't really something I was up for. And as the film closes, I could clearly hear the echo of an Arnold Schwarzenegger intonation, \"We'll be back.\" Giving, in my opinion, Mr. Cameron no moral authority to preach to anyone about how the sins of the military industrial complex rules our politics\n",

I like Giovani Ribisi but here he was like Jeremy Piven which is as bad as it gets. I also like Michele Rodriquez, but I am beginning to not like her..From Fast and Furious to Lost to Blue Crush she is EXACTLY the same in every movie.<br/><br/>So if you are one of those people that love Hollywood hyped movies, love talentless directors and love movies because they have big budgets and no heart or nothing original then this is your film..I gave it 2/10 stars and not really sure why it got that high of a rating.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar looks great. You can see where the millions of dollars have spent in the making of it. The forest and flying scenes are brilliantly done. The technology enabling the movement of the native people to be based on the actions of the actor playing them is flawless. However for my first 3D movie and I was a bit disappointed that there weren't more arrows flying past my shoulder. Maybe my expectations were a bit high! I prefer my films with a bit of character development and a decent story and here Avatar is a bit lacking. <br/><br/>The story is about an ex-marine working for a company hoping to make a fortune from the \"Unobtainium\" (really) found in abundance on the planet of Pandora. The cynical executives running the company pay lip service to environmentalism by building schools for the natives and employing scientists. However they also have a large army of mercenaries who will be used to remove the natives if they won't go voluntarily. They have also developed genetically modified \"avatars\". They look like the natives but are mind linked to human controllers. They hope to use them to persuade the natives that it would be in their best interest to move. Eventually our hero, through his avatar, ends up living with the natives and falls in love with their spiritual ways and closeness to nature. However he is also under orders from the mercenaries to get information on the best way to destroy the native camp if necessary. He has a moral dilemma. You know which way that will go and there is a big battle in the end.<br/><br/>So the visuals are excellent. You will definitely enjoy the ride! The cast are very much secondary to the special effects though Stephen Lang is brilliantly over the top as the macho head of the mercenaries. However the story borrows too much from the likes of \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Transformers\" to make it a truly satisfying cinema experience that will remain with you.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron sure has a way of telling us that he's still got it. Well known for great films like Aliens and the first two Terminator movies, James put his filmmaking skills to the ultimate test and what we got was a true masterpiece. He created a film that basically combined various movie genres like war movie, creature feature, underdog story, and romance into one stable and magnificent film. Let's take a look and the cinematic wonder that is Avatar.<br/><br/>The hero of this story is paralyzed soldier Jake Sully (Sam Worthington). He's brought to the planet Pandora, beautiful but dangerous world inhabited by strange creatures and a race of tall, blue humanoids with feline-like features called Na'vi. Jake is summoned to take part on a special project created by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) known as the Avatar project, where he can transfer his mind through a machine into a specially grown Na'vi body so he and the scientist can interact and convince the local Na'vi population to move to another location because their home is on top of a deposit full of a precious rocky material. As expected, Jake grows to care for the aliens and falls in love with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), the chief's daughter, and soon his loyalties will be tested as a great battle will come over the horizon.<br/><br/>This who film is a stroke of genius, even if the plot is somewhat predictable. Such a story does have plenty of sad moments like when the Na'vi lose their home and certain characters die, but it's nice to see the good guys and creatures kicking butt and many scenes involving the wildlife of Pandora are spectacular. Sigourney Weaver is still pretty attractive and the romance between Jake and Neytiri is rather interesting and well developed. The villains are hateable right from the start (in a good way) like Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and I enjoy seeing them suffer and die in the final fight. As for the animals, they are amazing like these hammerhead rhino creatures or the Turok, a huge pterodactyl-like creature that reminds me of Rodan.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Avatar is worth every penny and I look forward to any sequel coming up. Go visit the world of Pandora and enjoy.</div>,\n",

CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL<br/><br/>------------The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!---------------------<br/><br/>There have been only about a score or so of films that have transcended being simply a movie and, because of their unprecedented impact upon many millions of viewers, have contributed to our culture, becoming part of it, and more recently, to that of the entire world.<br/><br/>After being 62nd birthday-treated to AVATAR in IMAX 3-D by my wife, I state, for the record, it is an incomparable voyage, a magical mystery tour experience, to a poignant culture-clash on an enchanted world most distant both in time and spaceA movie it is not! Visionary James Cameron has created, crafted and orchestrated a labor of love for the ages.<br/><br/>At long last, CGI has come of age, finding in AVATAR a vehicle capable of demonstrating the awesome splendor of its true potential. We are transported to an intricately designed world, complete with a Neolithic race of aliens, rich with culture and traditions, speaking its own uniquely linguistically engineered on-screen language (A Cinema First) As for the \"It's Anti- American!\" grumblings:<br/><br/>1) The troops were not even U. S., they were corporate hired guns!<br/><br/>2) Life isn't about winning or losing battles: It's about living in harmony with one's environment!..At least that's how I saw it.<br/><br/>Wow! Talk about nefarious agendas!<br/><br/>In the opening seconds, James Cameron seems to pay tribute to both 2001 and Star Wars. Some reviewers have mentioned a similitude to Pocahontas. There were different moments that conjured up memories of story threads from many different films, but thematically, Dances With Wolves was, perhaps, closest. However, a straight up comparison to any other film does not do AVATAR justice. It is totally in a league of its own.<br/><br/>Every aspect of AVATAR is practically hyperbole-proof. Just look at the plethora of gushing reviews. Yet, amazingly, there are some 2*, even 1* ratings! Honestly, I can't fathom how anyone who has ventured more than 100 miles from their place of birth could rate it less than 5*. (The word Provincial keeps popping into my head!) Closing words: The only film in my life that raised the cinematic bar more was Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey(1968)..Don't just see AVATAR...Experience it!<br/><br/>10********** ......

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This is one of those movies that was so over-hyped, and overpraised that way too many people jumped on the bandwagon out of peer pressure. This was supposed to be Jame's Cameron's masterpiece, that he wanted to make for so long but had to wait for the technology to advance enough to make it. Guess what, it still hasn't advanced enough to make this any better than it is, a long boring cartoon!<br/><br/>I'm still amused why this movie isn't listed in the, \"animation\" section of every store and rental place. Because that is what it is. The basic story is those evil earth people travel to a planet in order to rape it of it's natural resources. The barbaric earthlings devise a way to create a sort of organic remote controlled robot to learn about the inhabitants of said planet and infiltrate them in order to steal their resources.<br/><br/>Now digital technology has come a long way, but look at Star Wars. The first 3 movies to come out (episodes 4,5,6) were beautifully done, and stunning compared to the crap George Lucas gave up with the horrible CGI mess that were episodes 1,2,&amp;3. Same story here. If Cameron was a decent director and writer he would have used a lot less CGI and gave us something better than a slightly darker version of a lot of Disney animated flicks. This is basically an updated, fancy version of what Disney did with the old movies like \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks.\" It's good for entertaining kids but that's about it.<br/><br/>Of course, Cameron had to suck up to all his Hollywood friends and cast Marines as bad guys (way to care about your country Jim) and show his compassion for the environazi cause. <br/><br/>As all director pieces given the \"masterpeice\" title, it has to drag on and on so that you just can't stay awake. When you wake up, you probably have reached half way. Dude, you may have fooled me into watching a cartoon, but you can't fool me into giving it a good review.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and who the heck hires Zoe Saldana just for her voice? You have a beautiful actress like that and the only thing you can give us is a cartoon character with her voice. Please, if I had to watch that old hag Sigourney Weaver through this movie you could have at least threw me a bone and cast Zoe as one of the real people...<br/><br/>The acting was, well, what can you say it was a cartoon...there wasn't any acting. Cameron's writing skills seem to leave a lot to be desired as well as he probably has never met anyone, besides Bob Ballard, that has ever wore a military uniform, and shows by making most of the characters as clichéd as possible.<br/><br/>The animation though is pretty darn good and stunning, but the problem with that is that this was not billed as a cartoon. So congrats and 4 stars to Jimmy for putting a bunch of real special effects people out of a job for this one.<br/><br/>If you are an cartoon lover , and have penchant for \"sustainability\", rent this one and \"The Lorax.\" Watch \"The Lorax\" first so that you will be all snuggled into bed for Jame's Cameron's bad, boring, animated bedtime story.<br/><br/>Like my reviews, hate em?

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is the movie that would end changing the film industry forever. After this movie was released in the cinema, it became incredibly popular to give movies 3D releases, however, they still don't know how to make the 3D look as good as it did in this movie. This is a visual masterpiece and you can thank James Cameron for his persistance and his vision that eventually enabled this masterpiece to be shown on the big screen. The movie has some very good performances, but the best performance is given by Stephen Lang who plays the main antagonist in the movie. He gives so much of himself in this performance and really nails the motivation and the villainous nature that this character needs. The story is, however, a very classic and it's something that we have seen 100 times before. The movie is a visual masterpiece, but the story really lacks something new and my only prayer for the next couple of movies is that Cameron comes up with better and original stories.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Developed as a action/fantasy/sci-fi film it has all the makings of a wonderful story. The cinematography is truly magnificent as are the scenery and tremendous action sequences. A film that has heart, defines what humanity is on a completely different level. <br/><br/>Jake Sully (Worthington) is a paralyzed Marine in a wheel chair that takes his murdered brother's place to go to the moon Pandora. He has no science background, just the will to complete a mission, he's a soldier. Once there he meets the rough, ego centric Colonel Miles Quaritch) Lang who is hell bent on destroying the Navi civilization. It comes to light money is the root of destroying this peaceful moon. However Jake has a change of heart when he meets Neytiri (Saldana) and learns the ways of the tribe. Sigourney Weaver (Grace) has a pivotal role as lead scientist and really gets inside the reasoning of Jake's turning point. <br/><br/>The moons components and CGI effects are amazing to view through the entire film. The character development is slow at first but truly picks up. I really enjoyed the complete package, BUT came away with a similarity of Dances With Wolves. I liked the film but believe it does NOT warrant sequels 2,3,4,5. 8/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This is unlike any kind of adventure movie my eyes have ever seen in such a long time, the characters, the musical score for every scene, the story, the beauty of the landscapes of Pandora, the rich variety and uniqueness of the flora and fauna of Pandora, the ways and cultures and language of the natives of Pandora, everything about this movie I am beyond impressed and truly captivated by. Sam Worthington is by far my favorite actor in this movie along with his character Jake Sulley, just as he was a very inspiring actor in The Shack Sam Worthington once again makes an unbelievable mark in one of the greatest and most captivating movies you'll ever see. This movie may completely turn the head of the old show of Avatar: The Last Airbender in some ways, but even I would've seen that coming even though I never watched the show. If you haven't seen this movie yet then you're missing out on something extremely astonishing and completely wonderful, it may even just change your point of view on seeing Earth and its flora and fauna and how to love and respect all of it as well as the planet itself. Take it from someone who's a complete lover and admirer of all forms of life on both Pandora when it comes to this movie and Earth and all it has to offer in reality concerning plants and animals. Avatar will amaze and astonish you more than you think both on the ground and up in the sky, this I 100% guarantee!!!!!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">First, he gave us slimy “Aliens” that Sigourney Weaver battled hard as Ripley. Then the cult hit “Terminator” that created a new benchmark for science fiction and followed it up with the smash hit sequel “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” which initiated many in my generation to Sci-Fi and admiration of Hollywood. “Titanic” mesmerized fans of both SFX and Romance genres while it pushed the envelope for elaborate production design.<br/><br/>More than 12 years after “Titanic” comes the most awaited movie of the recent years “Avatar” in which James Cameron has created a whole new Planet Pandora replete with new creatures, predators and humanoid aliens that in every way are beautiful! Well, it did cost him more than 300 million USD to make it and another 100 spent on promotion, but the spectacle that you see on the gigantic IMAX screen in 3D is beyond words!! <br/><br/>Set in 2154 and 4 light years away, humans are now exploiting ‘Pandora’ an earth-like moon orbiting a gas giant in Alpha Centauri for an expensive and rare mineral appropriately called ‘unobtanium’. Coming in their way are the indigenous Na’vi who need to be relocated from their ‘home-tree’ that sits on a deposit of unobtainium.<br/><br/>RDA, the company has already tried its best to convince the Na’vi to move. They have taught them English and tried offering infrastructure. But, being content in their natural settings, the Na’vi have no interest in what the humans have to offer. English plus business: doesn’t this remind you of European colonization in some sort? <br/><br/>The air on Pandora is toxic to humans necessitating the wearing of gas masks outdoors. To get around this, the researchers led by Dr Grace Augustine played by good old Sigourney Weaver have developed an alien-human hybrid ‘Avatar’ that can be mentally controlled by the brain of the person whose DNA was used to build it. Here, the idea of jacking into a computer generated digital-self will surely remind you of “The Matrix”!<br/><br/>The death of his researcher brother in the Avatar program leads to his paraplegic ex-Marine brother Jake Sully joining up the Avatar program. Played by Sam Worthington of Terminator Salvation fame, Jake is happy using his Avatar that gets him to use his legs. Soon, he befriends the tree living Na’vi and its huntress princess Neytiri. Learning their ways during the day, Jake returns to debrief his trigger-happy boss, Colonel Quaritch.<br/><br/>Soon Jake begins to appreciate the harmony and spiritual connection the Na’vi have with nature and falls in love with Neytiri, much to the dismay of Quaritch who attacks the home-tree. Though the script was written a decade ago, I believe Cameron has subtly hit out at the recent American battles for oil that the administration justified in dubious ways. For those who say the script is poor, take this quote from Jake Sully “When people are sitting on stuff you want, you make them your enemy”. Thought provoking indeed! <br/><br/>Visual effects are Avatar’s forte as it creates a new world before you. Filmed in blank sets with motion capture, the actors had to act out without ever knowing what it would look like on screen. Sensors on the Actors’ body and spots on their faces picked up moves and emotions bringing the CGI characters to life. To bring his actors up to speed, Cameron took them to jungles in Hawaii to bring them up to speed on jungle life. 60% of Avatar is CGI with only 40% being real footage. What you’re left with is a WOW! <br/><br/>While you may not see Zoe Saldana as Neytiri anywhere in its 162 minutes, the nimble ballet trained actor worked hard to make her character so endearing and realistic. The scenes where she trains Jake in the art of war are its best, be it bonding with the Ikran that seems like a flyer straight from ‘Jurassic Park’ or riding Pa’li the hairless horse.<br/><br/>The biggest blame that Avatar can take is that its story is too predictable. Man recruited to fight, falls for the local culture and turns his guns around; just as you saw in “The Last Samurai”. But, making Avatar cool are its special effects that seem so real in IMAX 3D.<br/><br/>Emotion seekers and script blamers can’t really deny the story’s soft side when you see the Na’vi suffer human attack and they die fighting for nature we have scant respect for. For one, Na’vi lived for everything we don’t. Politically too, the battle takes a dig on the suffering the Native Red Indians went through in the country that Hollywood comes from.<br/><br/>On Music, James Horner’s score doesn’t really stand out and has his ‘Troy’-esque feel. Probably, a score that doesn’t stick out as a sore thumb is good enough in a movie that’s all about special effects. As for Cameron and Horner, this is their third venture together after ‘Aliens’ and ‘Titanic’ with the latter giving him his first and only Oscar honors.<br/><br/>As a director, James Cameron doesn’t need a critic’s recommendation. He dropped out of college and drove trucks, but Cameron is the super benchmark movie maker with truly gifted imagination and commitment to translate his dreams to the screen. You simply can’t ask for more from a sci-fi movie at least for a few more years to come! <br/><br/>The least I can do with my review is to give it a 10/10. What are you waiting for? Go pull out your newspapers or log on to the web, check show times for 3D and book your tickets now! An IMAX would be even better. Believe me, it’s a bang for your buck!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">At the time of release everyone kept saying how amazing it looked, yet the story was a shallow lacklustre copy of 'Fern Gully' and 'Dances With Wolves', and a whole lot of 'Princess Mononoke'. And of course now after some time has passed, the CGI looks very cheap and obviously not realistic or amazing. All three of the films it copies are superior in every conceivable way to 'Avatar'.<br/><br/>So then you are left with the plot full of holes, cheesy hollywood stuff, and very very bad acting. Sam Worthingtom... How did he ever get a career in acting? Not only him, but most of the cast seem to be phoning it in here. And a word on the casting, it is awful; the selection of most of the actors here is depressingly bad.<br/><br/>I have no idea how people adored this move on release, and each year that passes it makes even less sense. It is a pure CGI blue screen festival. There isn't a single set with any reality in the whole movie, which is why it has aged so badly. Going through the watch was painful in 2020.<br/><br/>What is laughable is that Camron has planned another 4 or 5 movies of this utterly average film. The generic soldiers, and the evil mining corporation, the bland characters, and the woefully transparent 'tree people' aren't enough to make this into a franchise I think.<br/><br/>5/10 an average movie that was overrated during its hype era, and has aged poorly.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar. I heard it was a good movie and thought that I would check it out. Since I had reserved it, it took almost half a year to get it. I just finished watching it. It took three \"3 hour nights\" to watch it. Now I have seen it.<br/><br/>In one word, EPIC. This movie is epic. Just non-stop. From the beginning to the end. From the acting to the special effects. To the story. To the characters traits. Everything.<br/><br/>Now, I watched it on a portable DVD player which removes as much quality as possible. Which means I see the pixels on the screen. But even then, the movie blended in so perfectly that I didn't even notice the pixels. This hasn't happened with any other movie yet.<br/><br/>Now, believe it or not, this review COULD have received a FULL 10/10 rating (first one I would have rated that high), if it weren't for two things. First, why the constant swearing? Yes, it makes adults happy but for those who honestly couldn't care less, I don't need to hear the f bomb over and over again. But because they had profanity, I removed one from the rating.<br/><br/>The other is very crucial. I'll admit, this is one of the most epic endings ever. CGI, great acting. I thought having the main bad guy come out of the ship while it was blowing up was the most epic thing ever. And then seeing that it was good guy hero vs bad guy leader. That was epic. What didn't make it to the epic was the final kill. Yes, it was cool but there probably could have been a better way to kill him instead of using two bow and arrows.<br/><br/>But the final scene, with the guy lying dead on the rock, with the camera right at his eyes, and then he opens them. That was EPIC. No doubt. They probably had to take that take over and over and over again to get it just right. I know, I'm weird. But in order to end the movie, if the final battle is epic, then the final shot has to be. This was perfect.<br/><br/>So my final say is, if you haven't seen AVATAR, see it!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">While its initial previews made it look like \"FernGully\" meets \"Dances with Wolves\" with extra-large Smurfs in action, you can rest assured that James Cameron's epic return to the game, \"Avatar,\" is more than meets the eye. With twelve years gone by since the director's previous record smashing film, it's safe to say that his absence has been felt. There are very few directors who throw themselves into their work like Cameron does, and more often than not, his films are not only hits, but cinematic landmarks. Like his special effects break-through in \"Terminator 2 - Judgment Day\" and the massive scope and success of \"Titanic,\" \"Avatar\" is yet another benchmark film.<br/><br/>All the work Cameron put into \"Avatar\" (which has been on the back-burner since the mid-90's) has no doubt paid off, and if its box office receipts are any indication, this is a movie that is not soon to be forgotten, and is one for the ages that will be appreciated by generation after generation. Yeah, it's that good. If this generation has a \"Star Wars,\" then this, my friends, is it. Its visual effects are absolutely stunning and combined with the unique 3D presentation creates a world that you can truly disappear into. At times, you will forget you are watching a movie. You'll feel like you're in the jungle and you'll feel like you're a part of the battle. It's the little the things and the attention to detail that make the film so sweet. James Cameron is a perfectionist, and not for one moment does he let the 3D element of this film go to waste. It's less of a gimmick here and more of a device to transport you into the near-perfect world he has created.<br/><br/>While the plot itself isn't ground-breaking material - the man vs. nature thing has been done to death - it is presented in a way that manages to entertain and stimulate the senses while not beating you over the head with its message. It helps, too, that the pacing is smooth and the plot never sags. At about two hours and forty-five minutes long, you never feel the urge to look at the time or think of anything else (especially if you are seeing it in its best element - an IMAX theater). As far as the action sequences go, fans who have been craving a dose of the good stuff since \"Terminator 2\" hit theaters back in 1991 will feel more than satisfied, even if the bulk of it is saved for the final act.<br/><br/>If there are any flaws to be found, it is in the character department. While some are well-fleshed out and as three-dimensional as the film itself (Worthington, who also starred in the Cameron-less \"Terminator Salvation,\" gives a strong and sympathetic performance) there are a few that seem to fall by the wayside. Take the characters played by Joel David Moore (\"Hatchet\") and Michelle Rodriguez (\"The Fast and the Furious\"). Both characters fade in and out of the plot, and there are moments where you aren't sure where they stand. I suspect this is a case of the film being edited down to fit a fair time slot (although it could have been longer and not worn out its welcome) and there are some character moments that will be restored in a future \"Director's Cut\" of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, \"Avatar\" is a simply awesome cinematic experience. There have been few films to succeed with such broad goals, and yet, Cameron has managed to come back after many had either written him off or assumed he was done, and changed the game completely. Yes, it's hard to swallow all the hype that has accompanied this project, but if ever there was a film so deserving, it is this. If movies are meant to take you away to a different world to escape reality for a few hours, then \"Avatar\" more than does its job. Experience it now, while it's still in theaters. This deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible, and is a film you won't want to hold out for on DVD.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The only reason I gave this movie a 10 is that IMDb hasn't implemented 15's as a score yet. It is simply incredible.<br/><br/>There are a few naysayers who have complained about the plot of the movie. My only explanation is that they are just too stupid to appreciate what they just saw. The plot has everything you could ask for, and is very different from anything you've ever seen in a major motion picture. This movie could play without the soundtrack and the story would still be compelling.<br/><br/>However, the home run hit by this movie is unquestionably the special effects. Again, maybe some kids that have grown up in the 'great special effects generation' aren't able to to really watch what is going on and truly appreciate the achievement. In the car driving home, I commented that I was surprised I was actually getting us home ... the entire time images from the movie were still racing thru my head. <br/><br/>This movie is just truly a feast in every way. From the opening shot to the last the visuals are the most incredible I've ever seen in any media. To hearken back to the famous \"Superman\" advertising ... You WILL believe a 10 foot alien man can fly on a wyvern-like alien beast!\"<br/><br/>It all looks real, from the stunning alien world to the action scenes to the acting on the faces of the aliens.<br/><br/>Don't try to analyze this movie. Just go to see it, sit back, relax (when you can), and be amazed at this stunning achievement!<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX 3D. Once it is out of the theaters, it may be a long time before you will see anything like this again, and you will NEVER again see this movie like the experience you will have in the theater. Many movies are as good (or better) at home on Blu-ray. That will not be the case with this film.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I sound as if 3 Oscars is nothing big. How many films win 3 Oscars? I'm just admitting that the film is over-hyped yes, but still a phenomenal film. It's just not the type that wins 7, 8, 9 or 11 Oscars. It's actually well deserving of IMDb's 8.6 score and should be around 40th on the top 250.<br/><br/>One of the BIG reasons why the film is so great is because of the visuals, it's true. I saw it on IMAX 3D and was blown away. Cameron actually filmed the movie live in 3D and for 3D, using specific shots. The CGI in this movie is better than anything I've seen on film. I can't say it any more plainly than that. I can say that I haven't seen such detail since Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars before it. The planet in Avatar was very fleshed out, and wasn't just another technological planet with large skyscrapers or another planet with large mountains, waterfalls and dinosaurs. Cameron's art design team is very talented. The Navi were amazing looking creatures, feeling mythological even.<br/><br/>Now of course, the story was exactly what critics deemed as \"Dances with Wolves in space\" I agree, the only thing original was the Avatar idea which is mind boggling to say the least. I think it's a clever and original idea that makes me wonder how it wasn't thought of before. But all in all, nothing too original, I've seen Mechas in video games and the Matrix. I've seen anti-gravity craft in Star Trek. And I've seen this story before, definitely comparable to Costner's masterpiece Dances with Wolves. But after all these complaints, I still give the movie an 8. The directing was amazing and it's not easy directing actors with CGI, but Cameron mastered it because he had the right tools. 400 million is a lot of money to make a film, and not a dollar went wasted here. Even the orchestra was phenomenal, composed by James Horner who is no Hans Zimmer, but loved his score for this film.<br/><br/>This is one film that MUST be seen in 3D. I don't think there's any other ones out there.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Not a family film in my opinion and released at a time when families are tempted to go and see it together as a family. I saw it in a 3D cinema. Too long for 3D entertainment quite honestly, hurts the ears eyes and neck and you are straining to enjoy the spectacle even in a comfortable theatre seat. After the first 30 minutes, the novelty of the 3D effect wears off and tempted to take off the 3D glasses.<br/><br/>I agree the film is sensational with special effects and I love the story per se of the Navi people - but not the story of the film itself? why should everything have to be about America doing this, America doing that? why an American marine? why all that early film reterick from the Colonel? Why did it have to be Jake, though I understand what happened to his twin brother in the story.<br/><br/>Sorry, S. Weaver is a terrific actress but she is out of place and over-aged in this movie, she does work well with james cameron but not here. Makes me sad that Cameron seems to have concentrated on getting a message across concentrating on violence and that America can more or less take what it wants from whoever it wants, whenever it wants.<br/><br/>Ironically I saw The Box earlier in the day which also delivered an insinuative point raising a moral dilemma. The story of the film is extremely weak and more time should have been spent nurturing it and clarifying the characters. Many young and old will watch the movie and not understand it at all, especially those in foreign countries, who have no knowledge of the American invasion of Vietnam for example.<br/><br/>Alien and Terminator are superior Cameron films and this film will only be remembered for the 3D visual effects, not for any acting. it is not a bad film. Cameron is a pro and where nudity was apparent, it was discreet and there was no real bad language throughout.<br/><br/>Reminded me a bit of Braveheart and the William Wallace Scotland v England (we will get our way whatever) and a touch of Jurassic Park with the forest creatures. If Weavers character was meant to be prominent, she certainly had no lines in the movie to demonstrate her vast talent or to show why scientists were there at all in the conflict.<br/><br/>Bless the guy who played Jake, he carries the film completely (should have played the vampire in New Moon as Edward) and he clearly has acting talent. I hope no Oscars for this film because its pure American propaganda, no acting performance deserves to be nominated but consider it for special effects and visuals, that alone but not beyond.<br/><br/>Enjoy the film for what it is and perhaps don't take it too seriously. I get tired of films like this which depict America as a vindictive nation out to grab grab grab - the importance of the mineral the Americans were after was never fully explained - so the story itself was biased and overladen in favour of violence rather than alternatives.<br/><br/>Too long for 3D and not a family film, too many nauseating moments for young kids.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">To say that Avatar is incredible is an understatement. Writer/director James Cameron's first directorial feature film since his Oscar-winning directorial effort in 1997's Titanic proved that he can still churn out critically-acclaimed box office hits.<br/><br/>With an estimated budget of US$280M, Avatar is one of the most expensive movies ever produced, and is the first film ever to earn over US$2B worldwide, making it the highest grossing film ever.<br/><br/>Relative unknown Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation) is cast as Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine sent to the moon Pandora on a mission to infiltrate the enemy by assuming an alien body with the help of scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, who is reunited with her Aliens director). An accident facilitates Jake's acceptance into the alien community, but carrying out his mission becomes complicated when he falls for the alien Neytiri, played by Zoe Saldana (Star Trek), and the world he now sees with new eyes and he has to ultimately choose which reality he wants to save.<br/><br/>Since technically everything else is excellent, I have to gripe about the villains. Giovanni Ribisi (Public Enemies, Lost in Translation) plays Parker Selfridge, a sadly one-dimensional character bent on profits, while Stephen Lang plays Colonel Miles Quaritch, the stereotypical military man who impatiently muscles his way into anything. Both have no depth, no saving grace and become convenient objects of hate. Even Michelle Rodriguez typecasts herself once more by playing yet another tough girl role, macho helicopter pilot Trudy Chacon.<br/><br/>But that aside, the digs on the Bush administration's shock-and-awe tactics and the parallelism on the very current environmental degradation makes this cinematic experience easily digestible even when it takes its sweet time to entertain you, especially in 3D.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is possibly the most over-hyped film to be have ever been released this decade. Despite a rumoured budget of around $300 million, the film itself is a complete failure which lacks as much in substance as it does style. The main cause for this disaster, is primarily because of the one dimensional direction from the so called 'King of the world' James Cameron, who, previously had delivered two exceptionally great film's- The Terminator and Terminator 2. Almost every single shot throughout the gigantic and over-long running time consists of panning shots and those similar. Once noticed, it's only a matter of time until you begin to get agitated. Character development and a cliché'd narrative doesn't help a lot either, and further drags the film into it's failures.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This was a film of two very distinct parts that reminded me of Waterworld. Part one presents a fascinating new world and one learns about its internal logic. Part two is a standard violent US action movie.\n",
       " The opening part of Avatar is a beautiful film of an alien world that exists on a spiritual level that is beyond the comprehension of the humans sent to exploit the planet's mineral wealth. Consequently, the human efforts to subjugate the population can be seen as the vile and ruthless commercial exploitation that it really is. The willfull destruction of the natives' tree home is one of the most shocking movie moments I have ever seen. Soldier Blue's massacre of Amerindian women and children was considered shocking at the time - and still is, given that it really happened - but one would have hoped that humans reaching out to the stars would've evolved beyond such base drivers as conquest and resource exploitation.\n",
       " I suppose violence is inevitable in responding to creatures with such base motives and it is to the credit of a handful of humans that they take the other side (traitors to the human cause... really?), but the unequal struggle between primitive and space-age technology was a tragic waste of so many lives.\n",
       " I won't give away they key about how the tide turned, but in demonstrating their superior ethics and allowing the defeated humans to safely leave the planet, the natives paved the way for the sequel. Sadly, that sequel is most likely to be based on the return of humans with overwhelming force, hellbent on extracting bloodthirsty revenge. I really do hope that Cameron manages to come up with something more spiritually uplifting in Avatar 2.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar had a lot of potential to be amazing. It is still very good, but many argue against it since it ripped off Pocahontas/Dances With Wolves. Plots from previous movies or stories have been used and re- used over and over again and we don't complain about many of them being ripped off. Shakespeare has been redone countless times and there is something new with each retelling of his work. With the retelling of Dances With Wolves via Avatar we have a Dances With Wolves for a new generation. Unfortunately, some of the dialogue and plot points are terrible, but shut your brain off and it's a fun experience.<br/><br/>Let's look at the world of Avatar. It's a moon of a planet in another galaxy that seems to bring our fantasies to life with foreign lifeforms beyond our imaginations - monkeys with four arms, crossbreed lifeforms that seem to combine horses with zebras, giant flying creatures that we could probably only compare to pterodactyls, and the list goes on. The plants in this universe are strange and beautiful in their own way as well. Everything on the moon seems to have a blue or green tint to it, practically force- feeding the audience the idea that this world is supposed to represent a sort of Eden. The most notable factor of this world is the human-like creatures labeled as the Na'vi can literally connect with many of the animals as well as their sacred tree through a link that ironically resembles the way digital technologies connect in this day and age. Such a world and the connection between the natives and nature preach heavily for environmentalist movements. Finally, we have to remember this world was created with digital rendering, and the world is nothing short of beautiful.<br/><br/>Disregarding the elaborate world-building involved in this film, the movie is filled with clichés, cheesy dialogue, and one-dimensional characters. Let's look at various ridiculous aspects of Avatar. The name of the mineral the United States businessman (played by Ribisi) is looking for is Unobtainium. Surprisingly, that is not a joke. The head of the military sanction is a one-dimensional character set out only on destroying the Na'vi since they're \"savages\" (according to his cheesy monologue at the start of the movie) and so that his superiors can get their hands on the Unobtainium. He trusts Sully and believes he will report to him since he used to be a marine and makes a promise to get him his real legs back - that is before his use of the Avatar allows him to enjoy running again. Dialogue coming from this character as well as from Sully and even Sigourney Weaver's character are laughable at moments, making us ask why Cameron didn't consult many co-writers.<br/><br/>What this movie lacks for in quality of writing, however, it makes up with heart. The ideals the Na'vi strive for seem like they have been forgotten in the real world today, and they are what draw us and Sully to them as a community. We cheer for Sully and the Na'vi in the climactic battle within the film which lives up to other great action sequences in recent years even if most of it is CGI, though this film requires heavy use of CGI throughout, so why would the action be any different?<br/><br/>Avatar is good; it cannot be labeled terrible simply because it takes plot points from Dances With Wolves, but it does lack quality based on its disregard for good dialogue and some underdeveloped characters.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's been ten years now since Avatar was released, with revolutionary computer effects at the time with an incredible story to tell, it really is the reason why we go to the movies in the first place. Sam Worthington stars as our main protagonist as he ventures to the far off planet of pandora. The movie has stunning cgi special effects with some revolutionary mo-cap technology at the time which were Cameron's imagination is truly let loose as he crafts a beautiful and awe inspiring planet full of stunning and wondorous effects to tickle your eyeballs.<br/><br/>The movie was a major trendsetter for the 3D movie trend that would follow well into the 2010s decade with this and How To Train Your Dragon being the first two movies to bring the modern cinematic craze back into the movie theater. It really is James Cameron's most imaginative movie and it has aged very well after all these years and is still a wonder to gawk at after all these years</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is a fascinating special effects film which gets just about everything right. THe only problems I have with it were a one dimensional character and an average story line that gives us nothing special. Still, people will be awed by the look of this film, and will talk about the effects for a long time to come. It's a shame they won't talk much about the storyline though, or a certain one note character.<br/><br/>The Story of Avatar is set in the future. Earth is dying and their is a moon called Pandora which harbors a mineral that Earth needs to survive. This moon is inhabited by many weird and dangerous creatures, the most important of which is a race of giant blue skinned creatures called the Na'vi. The Na'vi live atop this important substance which is buried in the ground beneath them, and American forces are sent to try and drive the Na'vi off the land so they can mine this element. One person, a scientist by the name of Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver who is best known as the female hero in the Alien movies) thinks that they can come to a peaceful compromise with the Na'vi and get what they need. Another, Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), believes otherwise and thinks that force is the only answer. He recruits a paraplegic ex-marine named Jake Sully, (Sam Worthington who we last saw in Terminator Salvation) and offers him his legs back in return for some information on the Na'vi which will give the military forces the tactical advantage. Jake agrees.<br/><br/>Since humans can not survive the atmosphere of Pandora, they go in through organic Avatar identities in the form of the Na'vi, while there real bodies sleep peacefully in special machines. Using their brains while sleeping, they are able to control these second bodies and interact with the Na'vi. It is through this new form, that Jake learns about the Na'vi and their ways and falls in love with one of the Na'vi named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana last seen in Star Trek 2009). After nearly three months of living with the Na'vi, he has second thoughts about going to war with these creatures and soon has to choose sides. I will not say whose side he chooses.<br/><br/>THe acting was good, and the pacing was also pretty good for a movie almost three hours long. My only complaint would be with Stephen Lang who plays Colonel Miles Quaritch. His acting wasn't bad at all, but the character itself was too one dimensional, which is also what led to the less than perfect rating.<br/><br/>The plot seems complex, and it is not bad, but it is not an original idea. However, that is not the biggest reason why I only give it an 8 out of 10. Besides the one dimensional character Miles Quaritch mentioned above, the other reason I give it and 8 is because some of the dialoque is lame and corny and seems to take away from what is an excellent special effects extravaganza. If I could rate it on special effects only it would get a 10, but as I've said about movies before, special effects alone don't make a movie great. THe story in Avatar gets about a 6-7 rating which evens the total grade out to and 8. Still not bad, but I was still a little bit let down because of the hype. Recommended, but not a great movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'm not exactly sure when it became a thing among my tribe of film geeks to bash 'Avatar'. I know it wasn't when it came out, because most of the film fans in my circle of nerdy friends went to watch it multiple times and couldn't get enough of it. In hindsight, I suspect it was around the time when everybody and their grandmother seemed to have seen it; somehow, once the film had become the most successful movie ever (unadjusted for inflation) it stopped being cool to like James Cameron's eco-sci-fi extravaganza.<br/><br/>Nowadays the film is often brought up in snarky movie blogs as a typical example for a film with great effects but a dull story, unoriginal ideas and bland characters, as if this were somehow the general consensus among film aficionados. \"FernGully in space\" or \"Dances With Wolves with blue cat-people\" are some of the kinder descriptions the film has to endure - which in all honesty I don't get.<br/><br/>I mean, it's fine not to like the movie (all art is subjective and all that), but how so many self-professed film experts now pretend this critically acclaimed picture - which on Metacritic is rated even higher than 'The Dark Knight' - was nothing but a bland, unoriginal, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster that only succeeded thanks to the (then) novelty of 3D is frankly beyond me.<br/><br/>What I find even more astounding is how the very people who decry the lack of original, director-driven blockbusters in Hollywood are often the same who turn up their noses at 'Avatar': an original, director-driven blockbuster that came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels or adaptations of already existing intellectual properties. \"The ideas in the film are not original\", they claim. Come on guys, seriously?<br/><br/>So you've seen a world like Pandora before? A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests? A world where nature forms an actual neural network that stores memories and builds a collective consciousness? You've seen many films about a bio-database that people can plug themselves into via ancient trees and communicate with their ancestors?<br/><br/>You've watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco-system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs? And by the way: how many \"eco-sci-fi\" films have you seen? Such a worn-out concept and tired old sub-genre, right?<br/><br/>No my friends, in terms of Hollywood blockbusters, these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come, and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons (like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information). But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight-forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti-colonial, anti-imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci-fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience.<br/><br/>To that end, the film uses certain well-known story tropes (\"the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy\"; \"the soldier who realizes he's been fighting for the wrong cause\"; \"the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he's invading\" or the timeless trope of \"the fish out of water\"), but they are not what the film is about. And those tropes are not copied from 'Dances With Wolves' either - any more than that film stole them from 'Pocahontas': they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history, from 'Lawrence of Arabia' to 'Shogun' or 'The Last Samurai' and countless others.<br/><br/>And yes, our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters (though neither are they as bland as the film's most vicious detractors claim), but that's because they aren't really the film's main focus. 'Avatar's actual protagonist, its true star if you will, is Pandora. It's the WORLD we get to experience through Jake's eyes that really matters here, and the film aims straight for your gut - not your sci-fi nerd brain (which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans - now - claim to be disappointed with the film).<br/><br/>More than anything, 'Avatar' wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand-in for our own threatened world, and the film is an unapologetic, uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature - as well as a call to action to preserve them. Which on an emotional level works marvelously: nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree, which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon. It's a genius scene, and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of \"Home Tree\" does in Cameron's film.<br/><br/>So again (I'm trying to hammer my point home here ;-), 'Avatar' is simple? Yes, but that's the point: the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate; the themes are not just derivative re-treads, they're as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone. And that's exactly what Cameron's intention was: to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart-felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world. Which, given the film's success, it obviously did.<br/><br/>Personally, I think 'Avatar' is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right, and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness. And while this may only have been my own individual experience, 'Avatar' was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater - which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D. It was also the last time a film managed to do that.<br/><br/>And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular. It's a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top-notch CGI, filled with fascinating creatures and jaw-dropping future-tech, and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out, non-stop sci-fi action thrill-ride on a scale the world had rarely - if ever - seen before.<br/><br/>Obviously that doesn't mean it's a perfect film, and as I already pointed out, it's fair not to like it for any number of reasons (above all: personal taste), but 'Avatar' is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days. Get over it people: simple doesn't equal simplistic, and the fact that 'Avatar' is neither subtle nor cynical doesn't make it dumb (even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed ;-).<br/><br/>In all honesty, I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film - instead of the most successful movie of all time - many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci-fi adventure classic for the ages. And as far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what 'Avatar' is: a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur. Rant over.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar. For those who live movies within their hearts, they won't deny that Avatar is not just a movie. It's an event in the journey of movies. It's a big cinematic leap. It stands tall with movies like LOTR or Gravity or Batman movies. All these movies have one thing in common, they urge you to come out of your houses and enjoy cinema on giant screens. Even when you are watching these movies at home again and again, they just light up your TV screens and you are glued to them like kids. James Cameron's technical team's shining portrayal of planet Pandora , so many CGI characters having the soul of real actors, relentless action and drama make Avatar a highly enjoyable movie. The lead actor Sam might seem slow or boring but his honest sincerity as Jake Sully is unmistakable. All other supporting actors also give their ample support but it's only and only James Cameron's unexplainable vision that makes you sit through the event called Avatar. Now he has announced Avatar 2 and 3, I know he won't let us down. After all, he gave us Aliens, Terminator 2 and Titanic.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron must have woken up one morning and got a revelation. An angel must have come to him and said: \"You have to use your power to create something unprecedented, something that will shake the very foundation of human psyche\". And so the idea for Avatar was born. Either that or James simply watched \"FernGully: The Last Rainforest\" and then decided to redo it in 3D.<br/><br/>Utilizing the full potential of the 3D technology with what must have been a massive budget, as well as catching the actors on a good year, the creators of Avatar have set a new bar for movies to come.<br/><br/>The special effects are of course central to the film. There is hardly a frame where they are not present. The graphics astonish thanks to the realistic and high quality animation. Realistic movement in characters grabs even more of the viewer's attention thanks to all the freaky colours and lighting. Since the setting is an alien planet, the graphic artists had the freedom of creating beauty that does not exist down here at Earth.<br/><br/>All the actors were believable and well articulated. Perhaps this was done not without the assistance of computer graphics. Is that cheating? Hard to say, when your jaw is on the floor. Not to mention that some, like Giovanni Ribisi - plays the bad corporate - did not get any help from the special effects and yet performed outstandingly.<br/><br/>So have we hit perfection? Well...no. The story and its participants were getting progressively less mysterious and more cliché. Towards the end of the movie, the Na'vi alien people were less like aliens and more like a conglomeration of African, Jamaican and Arabic tribesmen, right down to what they were wearing, the noises they were making and their dialogue. The leader of the Na'vi is actually played by the Native American actor, Wes Studi, for crying out loud.<br/><br/>Also, the whole hippie go-green hype (oil and mining companies - very bad, we get it already) may have been a little too obvious here. If you're going to create something so creative, why stop half way? After all, the concept itself is not particularly original. A little more brain and mystery would really have brought this creation further.<br/><br/>The trip Avatar takes you on is well worth the money you will pay for watching it at a theater. Separately, some things can be criticized, but together, the experience is amazing and should not be missed, no matter what your taste in movies is. Avatar is entertainment at its 2009-best.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Unfortunately Cameron looks down to the public and offers us a story so full of clichés and of a simplified view of the world, people and the Universe in general, that it is truly condescending. Neither he nor the studio behind him respect their audience. And after they sunk a reported 400 or so million in the project who can blame them? They need to recoup at least most of this money, and they do it by trying to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. I think Jim Schembri from The Age sums it up very well: \"There's no argument that, as a showcase for the immersive potential of 3D visual effects technology, James Cameron's sci-fi epic Avatar is an unqualified triumph. But as a story designed to engage, enthral and entertain adult audiences for almost three hours, it is a disappointment strewn with weak characters, environmental platitudes and anti-progress clichés. A compulsive envelope-pusher, Cameron invented a pioneering camera system and ground-breaking visual processing techniques for the film, but perhaps he should have spent a little less time obsessing over the technology and a tad more developing the story beyond the compendium of clichés it regrettably is.\" My vote is 10 + 4/ 2 = 7.</div>,\n",

On Pandora there are life forms such as the navis that are about 10 feet tall have sparkly blue skin, big eyes and tails. The humans have genetically bred human-navi hybrids known as Avatars. Jake is able to walk but falls in love with a female navi and now he has to choose the side between humans or the navis.<br/><br/>The film was absolutely fascinating, interesting, entertaining and emotional. I loved the look on the Pandora jungle and it must be the best scenery in film history and the navis are definitely the best digital characters since Gollum from The Lord of the Rings. The special effects are so amazing that Pandora looks like a real location and you can mistake the navis as real characters. Avatar was almost 3 hours but it didn't seem that long. <br/><br/>Avatar already makes it on my top 5 favourite movies and I intend to see it again and I am already waiting for it to release on Blu Ray because I'm sure that it will be one of the best Blu Ray titles.</div>,\n",

To further explore AND exploit it and its civilization - giant, blue-toned nature creature race called Na'vi's - war veteran Worthington is called in on a mission to replace his killed twin brother by entering artificially generated double bodies of the Na'vi called Avatars... but has second thoughts after learning about the Na'vi's way of life and becoming one of them.<br/><br/>Action/sci-fi auteur James Cameron returns after 12 years with this highly hyped epic. Was it worth waiting for? Definitely yes! We're thrown into the action as quickly as possible and as a result, characters and their development play both second and third fiddle (and honestly suffer as a result), because here it's the world of the planet Pandora itself in the lead role. And some lead: the visual explosion, redefining the line between CGI and real objects, is nothing short of amazing, and means everything to draw us in, accept and surrender to its terms. It's a far cry from the plastic sceneries of \"The phantom menace\" or \"Attack of the clones\", e.g. with Cameron's unsurpassed sophisticated touches, including perfected technical machinery and weaponry. Naturally, this is not for cynics with no sense of fantasy and wonder, as fairy tale cuteness (I honestly had to choke a giggle or two at the first looks and sights of the Na'vi) meets rough, thunderous action. Again, I feel the itch to make a TV-series out of this, to do the whole Na'vi/Pandora mythos justice!<br/><br/>Theme-wise, overly obvious (if commendable) paraphrases and parallels of the white man's burden of the slow holocaust of the American Indians and subsequent colonial heritage are there. So are equally obvious old-time adventure hero clichés. But in all fairness, who else but the above-mentioned cynics would care when we have such a completely fresh and unique ballpark/fairground to play in? I haven't seen many complaints about \"Star wars episode IV\" totally ripping off the plot of \"Seven Samurai\", but still managing to be just as good a movie anyhow!<br/><br/>But this whole vessel wouldn't carry its load if there wasn't a heart that works, which I find in Cameron's huge plea for nature and environmental preservation, with a touch of the need for spiritual rebirth thrown in, just as he did in \"The abyss\". And any movie accomplishing that message to such a degree of bringing a tear to my eye, is easy to embrace. In all, a breathtaking adventure with action scenes all set and ready to move up on any such a best-ever list! <br/><br/>7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I may sound like I am exaggerating, but this movie has, from my perspective, such a surreal complexity, that the viewer (at least me) can feel a deep and warm connection with it. I think it was made in a way to *blow* the person watching it with lots and lots of stunning imagery and dynamic action, but not in a way to overwhelm him/her, but to make he/she feel relaxed and intrigued by the worlds and characters presented. It may seem like a movie about aliens, but, from my point of view, it reflects more the human nature and behavior. This movie is for me more than mind-blowing, it is a relief to see that we, as humans, can create extraordinary fictive worlds, and not just that, but the hope that one day we could live in those kinds of realms, we could create our own version of Utopia, through collective work and passion. And now I am just excited to see Avatar 2 in 2018 as I was when I began seeing the firs part of this movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Months before I had seen so much as a vague concept sketch for \"Avatar,\" I remember hearing that it would \"f*** my eyeballs.\" This statement was never employed in any official capacity by James Cameron or his marketing team, but rather coalesced online from Hollywood hearsay and snowballing hype. After all, this was the film Cameron, geek champion of the early Terminator franchise and 'titanic' personage behind the highest grossing film of all time, had been taming for decades, patiently awaiting the maturation of computer generated imagery and developing dual-lens 3D technology to realize his initial dream in all its stunning audacity.<br/><br/>Well, the consumer-end product is much more subtle than the suggested act of ocular penetration would indicate. Cameron has indeed achieved a landmark in 3D storytelling, using the effect sparingly to enhance audience immersion rather than to superficially draw attention to the gimmick. Set against the risky backdrop of an epic sci-fi/action film, \"Avatar\" mercifully resists the urge to send bullets or arrows whizzing through the screen, or to dredge the forests of Pandora past the fourth wall. Convincing three-dimensional depth of field is his greatest triumph, and Cameron crafts a world both vibrant and vivacious. However, outside the technical mastery and aesthetic perk, the world beyond my curiously uncomfortable plastic glasses quickly unraveled.<br/><br/>To begin, \"Avatar\" is beautiful to a fault. Cameron's Pandora, home to the peaceful, humanoid Na'vi and gobs of subterranean 'unobtainium,' which draw mankind and its drills, is described by militant antagonist Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) as a perilous nightmare of a planet. \"If there is a hell,\" he spits at a platoon of new recruits, \"You might want to go there for some R&amp;R after a tour on Pandora.\" Sounds terrifying, Colonel, but the visuals never really live up to it. Sure, our hero Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) comes to odds with some of the less friendly wildlife, but the forests themselves are always teeming with phosphorescent flowers and rich foliage illuminated by striking filtered sunlight. The bottom line is that Pandora is too utopian to ever feel like a real place, especially in contrast to the gritty live- action segments. There's a degree of intentional juxtaposition there, but the gap is ultimately too wide for a single creative world to bridge.<br/><br/>Besides being one-dimensionally wonderful, the design of Pandora's creatures and locales is seriously uninspired. As a love story, Cameron risks very little in making the Na'vi essentially nine-foot tall humans with tails, and the supporting creatures are textbook fantasy. You have your dragons, your (six-legged) horses, and your garden-variety re-imaginings of other familiar animals with supplemental eyes and appendages. Given that Cameron treats \"Avatar\" as an exercise in world building, its here that his film most disappoints. Beyond the intriguing concept of inter-species connectivity, which allows the Na'vi to link physically and spiritually with the flora and fauna of Pandora, Cameron's creatures are gorgeously rendered but safe and boring.<br/><br/>These predominantly aesthetic complaints may seem trivial in the greater context of the film, and to a certain extent they are, but \"Avatar\" is an effects vehicle, and those elements should be supporting the merely serviceable story rather than detracting from it. \"Avatar,\" for all its unoriginality, still succeeds as a high-octane blockbuster, far surpassing forgettable summer fare like \"Transformers 2,\" or the sorry state of the Terminator franchise Cameron founded. His film is confidently constructed, immersive, and often enjoyable, if overlong and unoriginal. It manages to weave its tale using a compelling new technology without feeling like a glorified tech demo, which is an accomplishment in itself.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" may not be the monumental leap forward in storytelling some anticipated, but it proves 3D can be used for more than making an audience flinch. There's plenty to enjoy when you don't buy into the hyperbole, so mediate your expectations and let Cameron's latest looker do what it does best: fondle your eyeballs.</div>,\n",

I own copies of films that I've given 1 Star Reviews of here, but I wouldn't accept a free copy of this flick as a Christmas present. Sorry, folks, but it's just Big Budget, Highly Overrated $chlock with some of the Worst Acting I have ever subjected myself to viewing. This flick makes the entire trio of the last Star Wars sagas a 12.5 by comparison, and my opinion of them is fairly low.<br/><br/>And if I've ever seen a Bad, But Perfectly Accurate Cliche about the Military (Regardless of whose military it is), this film wins an Oscar.</div>,\n",

I am not going to holler and cry that this was a major over sight when it came to the best picture award (but The Hurt Locker beat this??? Come on???) James Camerons masterpieces are nothing short of eye popping when it comes to visuals, his cinematography and use of cgi only add to a realistic journey anytime i sit through one of his films. In short i think he would be the only director that could afford to do these type of films ha ha!. The only problem i have with this feature is that i didn't drag the family out to see it in 3d in the theatre, and was also told that if i enjoyed it on my 61\" hi definition TV think of it as only being a fraction of how i would've enjoyed it in the theatre. Damn! maybe i will get lucky and they will re release it sometime in the hopefully near future. Great casting here as well. Major kudos to Stephen Lang, it takes a major actor to make you actually hate his character and he succeeds with little work. I will be purchasing this on blue-ray very shortly!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'm not very much into the films of James Cameron, in fact, I hated \"True Lies\" and \"The Terminator Saga\". But I loved \"Avatar\", mostly because I'm very interested into alien life forms and that sort of things, and because this is one of the best alien films ever made. The technology and special effects are just incredible, and the performances and the script are quite good, and the story, despite being somewhat clichéd, was very inspiring and beautiful. I loved this film. Along with \"Watchmen\" I consider this to be one of the very few good movies of the lousy year 2009. I simply cannot understand why someone would dislike such a good film as this. I can't wait to see the sequel!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">If you are going to see Avatar, see it in 3D. I can't imagine it having anything like the impact in boring old 2D as it does in 3D. Possibly 2010 will be the year that 3D finally comes of age? I really loved this movie – it blew me away. The movie just leaps off the screen visually and grabs you by the jugular.<br/><br/>The story is quite obviously director James Cameron's unapologetic take on the white man's conquest of North America and the assault on the Indians (well it could be any act of colonialism really, the British in Australia, the Spanish in Central America\n",
       " .. basically the locals are in the way of the invaders' desire to grab the resources), except in this case, the Indians win. You can call the story simplistic, you can accuse it of plagiarism, but it is what it is and Cameron need make no apologies for it. It's a vehicle for the stunning CGI, nothing more nothing less, it's not subtle but neither is it pretentious or 'posy'. What you see is what you get. And what you get is spectacular. <br/><br/>The performances are all excellent; I loved Sam Worthington in the role of hero Jake Sully. I last saw Worthington in the Australian movie Getting Square, alongside one of my favourite actors David Wenham and I think he has a huge future ahead of him as an international star. Worthington's Sully is a paraplegic ex marine on the planet (OK it's a moon really) Pandora, taking the place of his dead twin brother to become an avatar, mind melded to the genetically modified body of an aboriginal inhabitant of the planet. Pandora is under major assault from the military industrial complex, who are after a local mineral, Unobtainium. The biggest deposit of Unobtainium is right under the local's main spiritual site, and the invaders want to move them. As Dr Grace Augustine, Sigourney Weaver is in her element. Grace is the leader of the avatar program, and determined to protect the locals from the rapacious advance of the miners under the command of Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) a slightly rabid, gung ho Colonel who has little time for the bleeding heart, liberal approach to planetary conquest. <br/><br/>Going undercover on Pandora amongst the locals – the Na'vi – Sully in his avatar embodiment inevitably falls in love and turns from the Dark Side to the side of the angels, becoming a hero who helps them fight off the invaders. His love interest is Neytiri (Zoe Saldana – previously fabulous as Uhura in Star Trek). Neytiri is a bow wielding strong Cameron woman in the tradition he has established of Girlies who can take care of themselves - and I love him for that alone. <br/><br/>That is the bare bones of the story. It is how it is told that makes Avatar worth seeing – possibly more than once. Cameron throws in elements from just about every big movie franchise of the last two decades. There are 'nods' to Star Trek, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dances with Wolves, The Magnificent Seven and even, dare I say, My Little Pony. But it is all quite upfront and obvious, nothing subtle here, so I don't have a real problem with it. Pandora is a low gravity planet and the science makes reasonable sense. My spouse – who counts himself as something of an aviation expert – tells me the helicopter rotors were believable for low G, and certainly low gravity plus a very thin atmosphere might lead to tall, lean people of the type seem in Avatar, I'm not sure the blue skin color is believable, but who knows? Certainly if evolution had followed a similar course to the earth, the absence of a cataclysmic meteor impact might leave a population of large reptiles, even flying reptiles, and a fairly insignificant mammal population. This is all stunningly presented to the viewer in glorious technicolor and 3D which literally leaps out of the screen and grabs you by the eyeballs, aerial jelly fish float above the seat in front of you, primordial creatures leap off the screen at you. I haven't seen anything this impressive since I last went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and I found myself wondering how long Cameron has spent standing in front of the Sea Nettle exhibit? <br/><br/>Avatar is an astonishing achievement, and I am quite prepared to forgive Cameron the simplistic characters and linear story, because he has had the guts to produce something this visually stunning. I'm really looking forward to the next 3D offering that the movie world has to offer.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This is a film that you need to see on the big screen. The bigger, the better. This movie is James Cameron new \"epic\" and anything less that a large screen will not do it justice. The special effects are staggering, even if they are CGI and Motion-Capture. At times, Cameron blurs the points of what is real and what is computer generated. Sigourney Weaver is very good as a humane scientist and gives the films best performance, even if scenery chewing villain Stephen Lang comes a honourable second. Now that I have said that the special effects are indeed special (the planet of Pandora is staggering; every little insect is down to a tee, nothing is missed) and should (nay, will) win all the awards at the Acadamy Awards, lets delve into its weak points. First off, the story is not Earth shatteringly brilliant and has been done many, many times before in different settings and if the love story is redundant at least is doesn't take up to much screen time and the final battle fully compensates for that. Also, most of the performances range from the okay (Sam Worthington) to the bland (Michelle Rodriguez). All in all, a movie well worth seeing, but only at the cinema.</div>,\n",

The new dimension added to our world in the cinematic universe.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">In the 12 years since his mega-epic turned into a 'Titanic' even at the box-office collections, James Cameron has been busy transforming his childhood fantasy into an epitome of Hollywood's celebrated creativity standard. Drawing inspiration from several sources including George Lucas, Wachowski Brothers and Peter Jackson, Cameron created an all new world of unprecedented sights and sounds in Pandora where the Na'vi live in spiritual harmony with all of Eywa's beings. Humans, as always, have a selfish plan that would require displacement of the native race for extraction of a precious resource 'unobtainium'. Pandora's lethal atmosphere and the need for a humane approach prompt the invading Humans to back Dr. Augustine (Sigourney Weaver)'s scientific technique of infiltrating Pandora with Avatars created by mixed DNA of Humans and the Na'vi. Thus, a paraplegic ex- marine, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is chosen for this experiment and while he lays in the sealed chamber, his mentally connected Avatar lands on the stunning surface of Pandora. <br/><br/>Jake's mission is to provide military information about Pandora to his commander while he engages with the natives to gradually become a part of them and eventually convince them to relocate. This engagement reveals to him the the sheer enchanting beauty that lies within the homeland of the Na'vi. The bioluminescent forest grounds, the eccentric creatures that ram through the woods, hounds, little apes and the Banshees that soar over the majestic floating mountains of Pandora are all exotic creatures that are vividly depicted by the trusted WETA studios. Jake befriends Neytiri, a Princess of her land who, with her big golden eyes, big pointy ears and defensive snarls in moments of aggression introduces him into her world. The following tender love story between them is only disrupted by the urgency of Jake's real mission with an unreal deadline. Human greed gets the better of Jake's selfless attempts in salvaging the lair of the tribe and so, War is declared.....<br/><br/>James Cameron leaves no stone unturned on Pandora. His exhaustive attention to detail is simply overwhelming to the eyes that are hopefully wearing the 3-D glasses! With a plot that will by no means get him even an MTV Movie award, Cameron keeps us entertained through the 2 hour 40 minute duration of the film by making it a non-laborious tour of delight, exotica, fantasy, destruction, battle and victory. The plot could have been more convoluted to excite the nervous system or draw more sci-fi fans, the dialogues could've been more epic than generic and our world could've had a more unpredictable future but Cameron caters his Avatar to a wider audience with simplicity in those aspects while the focus of the entire cast and crew was to create the special effects, perfect the depth of field of objects for 3-D, delineate every detail demanded by Cameron's fantasies of another world and make sure it all looks awesome on IMAX. <br/><br/>Avatar is a showcase of tomorrow's motion picture. It sets a new standard in special effects for films and with its beautiful hues and colors, makes an absolutely stunning journey into a fantastic adventure on Pandora. Do your best to catch it on IMAX 3-D..... else, just be jealous of those who did.<br/><br/>9.19 on a scale of 1-10.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">If anyone tells you before seeing Avatar that they were expecting a well written epic, would you think he's retarded? Probably. Our little planet waits for this sci-fi spectacle for one reason--spectacular visual effects in 3D.<br/><br/>I just saw it in 3D in a Bangkok cinema, and I got what I had expected before. So, it's worth the price for anyone paid to see it(As you can see I gave it an 8/10). The phenomenon created by the actual viewing is almost beyond the words. Walking onto Pandora, both the audiences and Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) were awed by a very believable alien world. This is no \"Final Fantasy\", and this is definitely not a Pixar movie, it's James Cameron's visual ambition realized with 230 million dollars. As we see the complete alien ecosystem on Pandora, the lively details of every character and creature on the screen, one can't help being dragged into the world created by Cameron's team. Many scenes felt so heartfelt and thoughtful that you almost want to be a naturalist yourself. But, one can also start to build up another dimension of expectation as the incredible first act is enough to promote a well-developed mythology.<br/><br/>You might be asking why did I wrote such a negative title. Yes, you got the idea. After my expectation was inflated, the 2nd and last act only led to one dimension of story, which was already well told in $19million-budgeted Dances with Wolves. This isn't really bad, but a minor disappointment because this outrageous similarity can take the audiences back to their reasons and minds. While watching the 2nd act which involves some tragic situations, I couldn't help but noticing the Na'vis were actually native Americans in blue skins. The 3rd act only made me notice the lack of depth in the \"civilization clash\" theme.<br/><br/>Still, this is not saying Avatar is not a good movie. On the contrast, this review means to help you stocking less on the story side and totally immerse into the movie's visuals and logics. Concerning logics, I am already decided not to call Avatar a Sci-fi because it's more alike Star Wars. But be warned this is not Star Wars because the scale of the movie ate everything else, including performances. Though, Stephen Lang's Colonel Miles was a strong candidate for this generation's Darth Vader. Enjoy being a Na'vi!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron scores again! I have seen this terrific film three times now. First in the theater in 3-D, the best way to truly experience its awe and beauty, and twice on Blu-Ray DVD. This film is like nothing you've seen on film before. First off, it is visually stunning and brilliantly imaginative. It has everything a film needs to be a classic: fast paced direction, a fine cast, awesome cinematography by Mauro Fiore, a beautiful music score by the brilliant James Horner, unbelievable special effects by a fabulous crew of hundreds, fantastic sound and sound effects which make one feel like they are there on the planet Pandora. James Cameron is expert at directing wonderful films and he finds such talented people to work with. The cast is overall very good with the likes of Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver in the lead roles and such stalwarts as Giovanni Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez, Wes Studi, CCH Pounder and Stephen Lang in the supporting roles.. Many criticize the storyline, but I find little wrong with it. It borrows from Dances with Wolves, Braveheart and maybe Wall Street. It mainly deals with corporate greed. Topical? Hmmm. It's main selling point is truly the visuals, but the story is involving and the cast is good. I felt Stephen Lang played it a little over-the-top, but that's excusable. Cameron likes a bit of gung hoi-sm in his films. I find that so far the film holds up very well after 3 viewings and I'm sure it will after many more viewings. I wish I had a 3D TV.</div>,\n",

Do you fall for classic gutter to hero story arc? well we got 3 hours of the most processed and basic trash you can wish for! Avatar. A movie made for the average gullible viewer. Movie you will forget the moment you will stop watching it. Yawn fest for anyone with an active brain. Or 8 stars for a dumb ass like it was aimed at.

But then so is a visit to MIT. And last, we have yet another overly hyped movie that turns out to be not as great as the media for it leads one to believe. The plot was predictable and trite and done so often, in real life, literature, theatre, and the movies, one just wants to scream, or leave, which some people in the theater did (those who were not snoring that is). And maybe if there was more than just a single indigenous clan on Pandora the tribe would not be so peaceful. Think about that one: All one has to do is look at our own history. But what bothered us the most was that a lot of the action was fast and furious, thus we could not \"see\" it all. Some of us had to look away, close our eyes, or as I like to do, blur my vision; otherwise, it's Dramamine Time. And maybe if there was more to the plot, like a second tribe, and then all the tribes on Pandora get together to chase the humans off of their land, we would really have had something to work with. But if you want to be blown away with extraordinary F/X and not need a lot of brain cells to keep up with what is going on, then this is the movie for you.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"Avatar\" by James Cameron is arguably a perfect film judging by its methodological approach, and from a technical standpoint it still stands unrivaled as a feat of the vision of a director. Add to that charming characters as well as a touching theme, and a great film is in the mold.<br/><br/>The film is a mere spectacle to look at with well-deserved visual effects winning the team an academy award. Cameron did a fantastic job at writing, directing, and editing this film into a smooth script with excellent punchlines. The production design is overwhelming is still to this day practically unparralelled with incredible attention to detail from the sky to little bugs flying around in the evening air. The score by James Horner is nothing short of magnificent and fitting very well with the grand visual scheme of the film.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, and others deliver excellent performances, all of which are portrayed in very natural ways in spite of the sci-fi avatar-driven production.<br/><br/>Avatar has received a lot of hate for its seemingly adapted screenplay from Pocahontas. Rather than focusing on the plot this is a film which really utilizes the narrative in new, constructive and creative ways. As a statement in cinema history, I believe \"Avatar\" is a brilliant example of a director's vision for a film which at the time of its inception molded the state of the art.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">You would think that the man who redefined science fiction and action films over the past quarter century (Terminator, True Lies) and culminated with the best hat trick in movie history with Titanic garnering superlative reviews, earning the all-time box office, and winning a record 11 Oscars, would be satisfied and perhaps go on cruise control with a smaller film. But no, Cameron aims higher with a thrilling adventure that combines game changing special effects that have to be seen on the big screen in 3-D. <br/><br/>In the not too distant future, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a physically challenged soldier, volunteers for an unusual mission on a far away planet, Pandora, a beautiful yet dangerous world where the blue skinned Na'vi are a primitive, enlightened race who are at one with nature and its balance of life as epitomized by the Tree of Souls, a kind of fiber optic tree that has a consciousness. Utilizing a unique technology that enables Sully to become sentient in a genetically engineered substitute Na'vi body or avatar, he is deposited on Pandora to assimilate himself into their culture. Led by a stern, no-nonsense scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Jake learns the ways of the Na'vi people especially through Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a proud warrior (much like the heroine in Heavy Metal) whose father is the tribal leader. You just know that Jake and Neytiri are going to become closer in their relationship. <br/><br/>Sully's commanding officer, Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), expects him to gather intelligence on the Na'vi defense and capabilities in an effort to secure the valuable minerals beneath the Na'vi settlement. It seems that a mining company wants the minerals at any cost. As Sully bonds with these people and realizes that what the military plans to do, he has a change of heart and rallies all the villages to band together for a last stand and a simple battle between good and evil ensues with the Na'vi hopelessly outgunned and overly matched. <br/><br/>The story is simple with political overtones about preserving a green planet and the clash between science and the military. This military is an extension of the bad asses in Cameron's Aliens. There are obvious parallels to the Iraq War with its natural oil resource. You can see elements of The Matrix with its out of body experience, and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi with its David versus Goliath setup. Any fan of old Tarzan films knows how nature is harnessed by the hero. You get the feeling that this planet's life force is a collective much as the trees in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and that something extraordinary might happen. The avatar plot device bares loose similarities to the 1960's TV show Outer Limits episode Chameleon. While Jake has damaged legs, he is able to revel in his new body and experiences what amounts to a rebirth. His initiation into Na'vi life is not dissimilar to the initiation rites in Dances with Wolves. <br/><br/>Apparently Cameron has been gestating this idea for many years, waiting for movie technology to catch up to his complicated visuals. It was worth the wait. He has always been at the forefront of state of the art effects (The Abyss, Terminator 2) so it comes as no surprise that he has single handedly elevated the creative possibilities of 3-D presentation to the mainstream. Cameron does not resort to using 3-D as a gimmick by simply throwing objects at the screen but rather organically and even shots of the planet's jungles are fully realized settings with plant life and insects that jump out of the screen. The motion capture compliments and reflects real acting. What is remarkable is that this film is simultaneously demonstrating multiple visual effects in a seamlessly integrated presentation courtesy of Cameron's fertile imagination.<br/><br/>Production values don't get any better. James Horner composes an energetic yet tender score that evokes his own Titanic and Glory. Although the second half settles into a more conventional war film, that's a minor complaint. There is a reference to Jake's late brother (a subplot that does not add much to the story) who was originally slated for the mission. <br/><br/>Worthington and Saldana (Star Trek), in expressive motion capture, do a very solid job of emoting real feelings and making their love a tangible, believable union. Lang has an intimidating presence as the military commander and it's nice to see his career resurgence (Public Enemies). Weaver lends strong support as the wise, impassioned scientist who will defend the Na'vis even with her life. <br/><br/>Make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking film in terms of technical achievement and theatrical presentation. It needs to be experienced in 3-D to get the complete experience. Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this landmark film.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I did not see this movie in 3D (horrors!). What difference would it have made anyway? I felt as though the evil Mickey Mouse Disney CEO from the \"South Park\" episode with the Jonas Brothers was constantly present on the Internet and TV, telling the \"Avatar\" promotional staff and message board writers that, regardless of the plot, we, the potential audience, should not forget that \"it's in 3D...don't forget to mention it's in 3D!\" Is film now just about technological spectacle that we should totally disregard whether the storyline is a bunch of garbage? Is this what cinema has come to...just enjoy the 3D, and give us the Oscar? How crass! At least the Ray Harryhausen movies didn't pretend to be anything more than entertainment. \"Avatar\" thinks it's something better than entertainment. It's a preachy allegory that rams its message down the audience's gullet, using stock characters that have been in vogue in sci-fi for the past forty years.<br/><br/>Even without 3D specs, I enjoyed the computer animation. Pandora (why this name? I'll get to the annoying allegory presented in \"Avatar\" later) is stunningly beautiful. The aliens DO express genuine human emotion, like grief and joy, very convincingly. Kudos to James Cameron for using the best state-of-the-art CGI techniques to make the Na'vi look realistic. The computer animation for the aliens most certainly DOES NOT look fake. So, King of the World, a tip of my regular specs (in lieu of the 3D ones) to you!<br/><br/>Now for the plot...here's where I'll have some fun and be evil by to peeing on the King's parade! The villains symbolize the evils of mega-corporations in our own world. Then again, this theme has been done to death in far better movies, such as \"Alien\" and its Cameron-directed sequel and \"Robocop.\" The protagonist's union with the alien tribe, and his relationship to the evil conglomerate, is reminiscent of a film that came out earlier in 2009: \"District 9.\" I'm not saying the King of the World and the \"District 9\" people had a pizza party together one day and swapped plots over cans of Bud Light; but, there is probably plenty of plot repetition in Hollywood because there is a dearth of creativity. Great minds, contrary to the platitude, do not think alike; mediocre minds do.<br/><br/>I did like that Cameron made the aliens primitive hunter-gatherers rather than high-tech space explorers. In a sense, the Na'wi, who literally live in the trees in a green forest moon, are Ewoks, expect not as cute and cuddly. Anyone who has seen \"Return of the Jedi\" will start to wonder whether Cameron visits Skywalker Ranch for some R and R with George Lucas, where both men extol their own wealth and genius. The Na'vi are, like the Indians in Westerns since the 1970s, \"noble savages\", with a pedestrian New Age spirit. They LITERALLY commune with nature and worship Mother Earth, whom they call Eywa. Paging \"FernGully\", Dr. Cameron? The fact that Pandora is alive is a thinly-veiled reference to the Gaia Hypothesis. This idea was presented without any preachiness in \"South Park's\" \"Lice Capades\" episode and George Carlin's monologue, \"The Planet is Fine.\" I hate being preached to by a man who, ironically, consumes plenty of Gaia's resources by virtue of being wealthy (we're all guilty of raping Mother Earth, by the way, but \"Avatar\" simply wags its finger at us and doesn't offer any practical solutions).<br/><br/>In all, I must repeat... \"DON'T FORGET IT'S IN 3D!!!\"<br/><br/>P.S.: I rate this film as highly as I do because the actors do a hell of a job, in spite of their clichéd characters.</div>,\n",

Avatar was truly a breakthrough in filmmaking almost comparable to what Star Wars did in 1977, from the visual effects aspect of filmmaking. The motion-capture technology and advanced rendering sistem was nearly invented with this film, and is now commonly used in many films. And this movie is one of the few ones that has no CGI flaw in nearly 3 hours almost entirely shot in CGI, which is quite outstanding. We're introduced to a visually appealing world, really wonderful and also realistic (thanks to the mentioned advanced visuals). The opposite military-sci-fi technology of men makes the whole film unique. Story wise, it almost seems a natives vs white explorers story, just with aliens versus humans, and some misticism of different sorts. The existence of the dragon-like creatures makes the whole thing get a fantasy touch too. Plus we have some good old sci-fi, with the concept of Avatars. Really, this movie has a quite unique merging of different concepts. Casting worked perfectly to me, and so did direction. The ambientalist/freedom message is though kinda obvious, but it's also not as important as it might seem in order to enjoy the film. I really enjoyed the depiction of battles as well.

This film started off good and just got better until the point about halfway through when I fell in love with it.<br/><br/>The acting was superb from all the cast in particular Sam Worthington as the Protagonist, Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana with good support from Michelle Rodrigeuz. The action sequences were exciting, it was superbly shot and the 3D just blew me away. It was amazing and made the scenery of the lush forest and mountains simply breathtaking with perfect attention to detail with the different plants and animals.<br/><br/>The story was good with some unexpected twists and though the dialogue and script were basic, it was never cheesy or corny and there was some good and witty funny one liners and later with a small romantic subplot between the two main leads was touching and believable made the script feel more meaningful and the music was simply beautiful.<br/><br/>This is the best film of the year for me and knocks Star Trek off the top! It's also Cameron's best film and one of the best of all time. Avatar in 3D gives the audience such a unique experience with the visual spectacle. This movie makes Cameron for me stand alongside Steven Spielburg and Peter Jackson as the Hollywood Kings of directors. This cost 300 million dollars to make and five years to do and it shows. This should get Oscars. If you haven't seen this yet. I implore you to go. You will not be disappointed. Absolutely incredible!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Some films just have to be seen on a giant screen and Avatar is perhaps the ultimate example. In 3D and at the pictures it looks stunning. I don't know how James Cameron and his team have done it, but Avatar is the most amazing visual experience I've seen from a film. The blend of colours and effects are spectacular. I've often been very critical of the so-called blockbusters which rely on special FX, but Avatar does it all so well. The story revolves around the battle to save the moon Pandora from the ravages of commercial miners. Clearly there are big themes concerning the rights of tribal peoples V imperial objectives. Leaving that aside, there is plenty of action, with very impressive set-piece battles featuring all kinds of futuristic military might taking on a range of weird creatures. The characters are interesting and engaging, with Sam Worthington a good lead as the disabled marine who is transformed via some unexplained techno-wizardry into a humanoid. The film was quite long, but never relented. A must-see at the cinema: if only I could afford a 3D home cinema!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">My history with this marvelous film covers a broad spectrum. Opening weekend, in our excitement we took the last seats available in a giant IMAX theater near Washington D.C. It was my fault that we set in the second row and I got motion sickness from the 3-D. (Literally had to go out for fresh air a couple times.) So, although I admired the look and risks of the filmmakers... I missed seeing several sections and the plot lost me. Again my fault. <br/><br/>So a year goes by and we are returning from England on a jumbo jet that offers Avatar as in in-flight movie (ha! what waste you say) and I say, yes but. If I don't get a film (as in this case) I may need to revisit and watching a 7\" screen forces one to listen to the dialogue, understand the characters motivation and delve deep into the story -- if it's there.<br/><br/>I was rewarded with a wonderful story of redemption, healing, respect, greed, love, compassion, fear, force and surrender. Bottom line I too recommend it's ideals of respecting nature and natives all the while selling popcorn, tickets and DVD units.<br/><br/>Today, I'm watching my BluRay on my 4k giant screen TV and it hits me... a soldier sent to a remote outpost meets and bonds with the locals. And even though he is an immigrant (another word for stranger), the locals are patient and forgiving eventually welcoming the new person as a friend, even family... then someone with more money/power/resources FORCES their will on the smaller, weaker claiming it is for their own good that they are being robbed, stolen from and killed... just like in Dances With Wolves. (another fine film.) Thanks for reading, larry41onebay.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Amassing more than two billion dollars through worldwide box office collections, Avatar easily qualifies as the most ambitious and successful sci-fi movies to emerge out of Hollywood in the last ten years. The movie, undoubtedly, offers groundbreaking visual effects tailor made for a 3-D spectacle. But does the movie, preoccupied with technology, unwittingly sacrifice cinematic quality? In my opinion it partly does, thus compelling one to question whether the success it enjoyed globally, unwarranted? It is, often observed that movie producers adversely manipulate the storyline and screenplay to accommodate visual effects. Avatar is a case in point. The fusion of special effects and the basic screenplay in the movie doesn't reflect a work par excellence. The movie's storyline in turn, is not very original either . There are aliens and humans involved in battle, albeit occupying different roles without actually doing anything different. It is merely a case of ad verbatim role swapping in an all too familiar thematic setting. In this sense the rave reviews which the movie attracted, allegedly on account of a groundbreaking shift in storyline, seem to be misplaced. The dialogue is not catchy, the characterization a tad stereotypical and the message all too familiar. In my opinion, Avatar is a high quality exhibition of special effects and needs to appreciated as such , but as a movie, it does not score very high and though moderately entertaining , is a run of the mill proponent of 21st century's sci-fi cinema.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Of course the special effects are mind-blowing even on the little 16 inch computer screen i saw this film on. But the story is very much by the numbers. Another good guys versus bad guys story with no shades of gray. The Navi are all good and just about all the humans are bad. It reminds me of Star Wars from 30 years ago in how the story just doesn't grab you.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver have big parts but i didn't care for either of them. Both came across as boring liberal do-gooders. Steven Lang is great as the bad guy colonel. The girl who played Trudy was a real pain. Why does every action movie have to have a girl who tries to be just as macho as the men? Just more feminist propaganda and very irritating.<br/><br/>Still i did enjoy the movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Ah, Avatar. The highest-grossing movie of all time as well as one of the most insanely hyped. It is often recognized as a milestone in filmmaking. I know that I'm far from the only one to espouse this opinion, but I feel that the amazing technology and special effects on display save this film from mediocrity.<br/><br/>Let's get the obvious out of the way. Pandora is of course a wonder to behold. It's a totally immersive experience, and gives you a sense of wonder. The sheer visual splendor and world-building alone managed to keep my attention for a good while.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that is really the only thing about this movie that is truly groundbreaking in any way. The story is pretty pedestrian and nothing new whatsoever. As many have pointed out, it borrows heavily from many other movies of its kind, most notably \"Pocahontas\" and \"Dances With Wolves.\"<br/><br/>The performances and main characters are serviceable, but sadly nothing more. Jake Sully's relationship with the Navi was pretty interesting at times, but is sorely lacking depth. The dialogue isn't that great, either.<br/><br/>One of the film's biggest problems is its 161-minute running time. As I said earlier, the film kept my attention for a while, but during the last 30-40 minutes, I pretty much lost interest. It also didn't help that the themes and messages felt pretty heavy-handed at times.<br/><br/>It hurts me to be critical of this film, because James Cameron is one of my all-time favorite movie directors. I'm giving this film an above-average grade just for the amazing visual experience alone, but basically everything else was average in every sense of the word. Were it not for the enormously high budget that went into making this, it would probably be forgotten by now.<br/><br/>RATING: C+</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Jake Sully arrives on the planet Pandora to take the place of his dead brother in using a creature known as an 'Avatar' to try and move the native people from their home, so humans can mine for a rock that's under it. However, as Sully spends more time with the Na'vi, he finds his loyalty tested....<br/><br/>James Cameron spent around 14 years getting the technology he needed to film this movie. Filming the actors using motion capture technology, then using CGI to replace the actors on screen. It was used for characters such as Gollum in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, and on movies such as Beowulf, however this is without doubt the best use of the technology in a movie so far. The CGI is stunning, creating an imaginative world and also some impressive alien creatures.<br/><br/>It's always hard to judge performances when done using motion capture, but I'd have to say on the whole the cast are pretty good, the stand-out being Stephen Lang as Col. Quaritch. Sam Worthington as Sully is also very impressive in the lead role.<br/><br/>Cameron, as he has shown in the past stages some very impressive action sequences in the last part of the movie, but also directs the quieter moments very well to.<br/><br/>However....<br/><br/>First of all, for all the time spent on the technology side, Cameron should have spent more time on the story and script. The plot line is very predictable, and some of the dialogue is very poor. Perhaps next movie, he should bring in a scriptwriter to help out.<br/><br/>The 3-D side of the movie, while impressive wasn't the immersive experience I was expecting. In fact, I don't think the movie actually benefits being in 3-D at all. I'm one of those waiting to be convinced that 3-D is the big thing everyone thinks it will be, and nothing in Avatar on that side convinces me.<br/><br/>As I said the CGI is very impressive indeed, but as good as it is, and as good as the action scenes are done, there is no actual tension or excitement. Unlike movies of the past, where you had stunt-men doing actual stunts, the reliance on CGI in modern movies has taken that away, resulting in no sense of dread or risk during the action parts. Avatar isn't the first movie to suffer for this, but it is becoming more and more apparent in movies these days and I wish it would stop.<br/><br/>Another flaw with the CGI is that, some of the emotional aspects of the movie are lost. While it is without doubt the best movie yet of it's kind, the technology still, as yet can't get the emotional side of the performances quite right. It is close, but until they can solve this flaw you won't feel for the characters and their story.<br/><br/>The film is also far too long. The central section of the movie goes on and on, and slows everything down. I'm understand why it's there, to show Sully falling for the Na'vi culture, and also in love, but it just feels baggy.<br/><br/>There is no denying that James Cameron has created a movie that looks fantastic. But I wish he'd spent as much time on the script as he had on the technology side. If he had, he might have made a movie that is the so-called 'game changer' of the movie industry that Avatar is claimed to be (though to be fair, I don't think Cameron has said this himself). Instead, he has only made a movie that looks good, but nothing more.<br/><br/>A pity.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">$230-300 million later, James Cameron wanted to make the kind of movie he wanted to make... and it worked. Kids were leaving the prior screening to mine saying, \"It was awesome!\" Adults walked out of this theatre saying it was amazing. The guy beside me right now on the bus is telling his friends over his cell how incredible and really good the film is and he will see it again with them tonight after shopping. Steven Spielberg saw a viewing and said he hadn't felt this way since Star Wars. And in many ways, they're right. Watch the movie in 3D. It is a visual treat.<br/><br/>To dispense of the one standout flaw, the melodramatics and the acting, you have to really ask yourself, is all the really good action movies about the acting? Avatar succeeds because the plot is not as ridiculous as 2012 or Revenge of the Fallen. We can suspend belief because the film is not overly ridiculous, even with the 'indigenous' blue aliens. The only thing that had me scratching my head was having to buy the fact that Pandora, with the twigs, trees, glowing grass and creatures is one giant Facebook and that Aiwa is the Internet connection between them all. But if that is a complaint, I really have nothing to base it on because this is vintage James Cameron.<br/><br/>The theme is man vs nature and man is the bad guy. There is an image shot of the main bad guy in a mechsuit when a helicopter goes down behind him that is vintage Cameron. It shows the destructive nature of man and here he is. But that image is a footnote compared to the planet Pandora. The planet is very much full of life and leave it to the King of the Friggin' World, James Cameron, to be man enough to invent technologies and anything else he desired to realize his vision. That alone is reason enough to believe this movie will stun theatregoers. It really cannot be watched at home. Get the 3D glasses and experience it at the theatre.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar claims to be the revolution in VFX and movie storytelling, and given the pedigree of its director you wouldn't be blamed for thinking it's true.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film is a rather by-the-numbers sci-fi romp with a thin moral message clumsily woven throughout. The CGI is very nice, but even back in 2009 it didn't really seem THAT impressive, and now it just looks quite stock.<br/><br/>James Cameron has always liked his technology and that's fine, but he seems to use films more as tech demos as the years go on, and it's got to a point where the Avatar obsession is getting ridiculous.<br/><br/>Cameron is planning multiple sequels to this film, but quite honestly it barely even deserves one let alone the four he has in mind.<br/><br/>It's a decent way to kill a couple of hours, and it can be fun spotting vehicle designs that are similar to stuff in Aliens and The Terminator, but unfortunately that's the extent of its quality.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I do not think there is any original way of saying that this movie is in one aspect possibly one of the most revolutionary movies that I have seen, but boy is it a bad movie. I realize that I gave Beowulf a good score and the rational that went into giving that a movie a good score also applies here, but the complete lack of anything inspired outside of the technical aspect of the movie is discouraging. I do want to say that the score was good, but did not stand out for me. I saw this movie having to sit in the 7 or 8 row and I had such a terrible head ache at the end of it, but I could not take my eyes off of the screen. I really did not think \"that must be CG\" as many times as I would have expected and did really get caught up in the world created. All of the great things about the technical side can only begin to describe the experience and it really needs to be experienced for oneself. The writing was terrible and I could predict the story line way to quickly. I even saw how they were going to transfer the characters into their avatars permanently within the first 30 minutes. The acting honestly was not that good, but something must be said about the characters that were simply motion captured. I think they could have turned out to be fully fleshed out characters if they were written to be more than 1.5 dimensional. There were not quite one dimensional, but not even close to being fully fleshed out. It is a shame too because I really like a lot of the actors in the movies. My friend I saw it with described it perfectly as the best Fern Gully remake ever. I just want to see what a creative team like Pixar can do with technology like this and not just see what Cameron can do with a near unlimited budget.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">My review for this film will be pretty cautious because James Cameron as a very intelligent movie maker has implied a complex movie structure in here, much more than we explicitly see. I believe that touchy social geneses of today world is so obvious for every spectator who gets in this movie not only on action and technological bases but on emotional as well. Very carefully operated, so many strong messages behind the screen. Otherwise, we would probably have Disney Star War movie or SF Dancing with Wolves. Cameron started to warn the world we are calling civilized with his Terminator robots decades ago but we have never seen him drawing so clear line. Apparently, Na'vis exist ever since the time of the civilized world, they have to exist as opposite of being civilized. Their existence underlined in the start as savage and cruel is justifying the genocide and destruction done on them by our cute civilized world. First distinctive Na'vis were probably American Indians who clashed with greedy civilized colonists that did not want their precious materials only but their land as well. Indians won first battles just like Na'vis, but than ships of the civilized world came back and exterminated them, taking everything from them thereafter (here, do not miss Avatar 2). Similar things have happened over the centuries with Asian Indian, Chinese and African Na'vis for different precious materials, happens today with Iraqi people because of oil, Afghanistan because of drug profit control ... And civilized greediness never ends. Jack Sully the lonely hand of conscience is pretty lonely indeed. We can see that he and his few friends are truly dependent of the greedy empire. Does it ring your bell? Journalists, \"peacemakers\" and \"world judges\", everything bought or blackmailed in most sophisticated ways ... there are tortures and cleansings of whole nations while we are sitting in our cozy little armchairs and giving no sht about that because it is far enough from us, done in the name of us by our civilized army representatives ... and it certainly brings profit and peace to us, we think. Can at least minority of us act against evil only in our dreams, just like Jack? Are we capable of leaving our cozy armchairs for the sake of good? Mr Cameron opens nice questions. As for the SF background of the film most of the scenes look animated, Disney style. The Na'vi humanoid looks like a cartoon character but still fits in the story somehow, could be better for the money spent. Frankly, probably the greatest thing about this movie was marketing campaign. Wow! Compares to that Terminator was zippo. I knew that no movie can satisfied expectations of that hysterical movie marketing but I got more than I expected. All in all, should be seen by both humanoids and Na'vis.</div>,\n",

Endgame had years of build up for an epic final conclusion of the infinity Saga, 10 year in the making with 20ish movies working twards one final goal, KILL THANOS .... i dont get the love for Avatar.. this movie is so boring and so long... it looks nice enough, but, hold on..... wait i need to YAWN !!!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The special effects were enjoyable but the film really lacked substance. The tribal nature of the \"smurfette\" blue aliens closely resembled the tribal peoples of earth in quasi montage of African and Red-Indian semiotics permeating throughout the images and customs and even accents. Cameron then very subtly adds animated nippled breasts and other body parts to guarantee the titillation of a massive audience of young males and I even heard male teenagers commenting on these aspects as we left the Cinema as well as general feedback from this group. <br/><br/>It is beyond credibility that the Americans depicted as the evil military complex invading a planet and destroying all that is natural would have in that context would have completely annihilate this small tribe of only a few thousand using biological warfare let alone incendiary missiles. They certainly would not have allowed the far fetched experiments of mind transformation into biological clones especially using a crippled marine. If the mineral cost 20 million for kilogram one wonders what the hell it was used for. <br/><br/>The whole film was ridiculous and pathetic. <br/><br/>To all you lovers of this movie I am so glad I am separated from you tasteless fools with this film. Sam Worthington emerges as yet another expressionless ugly Australian actor who has used his families wealth to hit the big time.<br/><br/>Of course the film has been a great financial success but so is Macca's hamburgers proving once again that junk food and films are gratifying to the masses but really lacking in true wholesome substance.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Over the years James Cameron's, Avatar has become an extremely controversial movie with some people calling it groundbreaking and a masterpiece and some calling it an overlong and derivative bore. I find myself not completely agreeing with either side but I do believe that it's got far to much um warranted hate. The main hate from this movie comes from that fact that it's got a few blatant similarities to other movies and it's probably this films greatest short coming but it doesn't kill the films it got far to much good in it for it to be considered bad. But one other slight negative with the film is the fact that Sam Worthington is a but bland in this film he just never really stands out or does anything other than what he's required to. But Zoe Saldana is amazing in this film she just completely invests herself in this character and is the greatest motion capture performance since Andy Serkis in Lord of The Rings. The one thing that no one can call derivative in this film is the world of Pandora it is incredible the landscapes look incredible and the Nav'i look incredible they're culture is interesting and entertaining to watch grow. The action sequences look amazing and you feel the scale of these two races fighting each other only through Cameron's direction. In all honesty there's nothing particularly special about Stephen Langs villain but he's incredibly entertaining and holds his own in the battle scenes. <br/><br/>I hate the fact that so many people have turned on this movie when James Cameron so clearly poured his heart and soul into it. It looks incredible and has mostly great performances and is truly a movie that (even though similar to others) is like nothing I've ever seen before. <br/><br/>89%-A-</div>,\n",

Not that but she also gives him oxygen mask. Hahaha... That was the mistake by makers otherwise the film was completely amazing. Thank you.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar<br/><br/>This motion-capture film is directed by James Cameron. I saw it in 3D Imax, and I recommend that version for the effects. The plot is nothing special: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.<br/><br/>Our hero is Jake Sully, and he's a paraplegic whose twin brother died. His twin was scheduled to control an avatar on the planet Pandora, an avatar cued to his DNA. Since they were twins, Jake can take his place but hasn't had the training, so we get to watch Jake get all the stuff explained to him so we know what's going on. Obvious plot device. Generally, the planet Pandora has a mineral we want for commercial purposes, but the planet is inhabited by people who are connected physically and spiritually to the entire planet and its biosphere, and these people don't want us taking their stuff. Jake is sent to the planet's surface where he assumes the shape of a local inhabitant through the magic of science - he's an avatar with full mobility again. His goals are (a) get the inhabitants to agree to us taking the mineral and (b) failing that, discover how to destroy their home most effectively so we can take the mineral with least cost (in lives and money). Naturally, Jake falls in love and becomes one with the planet himself. He leads the aliens to a successful uprising against the hostile corporate take over.<br/><br/>The plot has been compared to \"Pocahontas\" and \"Dances with Wolves.\" I'd guess that's fairly accurate. It's not a bad movie as movies go - good action, great effects. The bad guys are too cartoonish for my tastes, and the ending is deus ex machina, which I didn't like. However, the 3D Imax experience overwhelmed my sense of good film and gave me enough pleasure to like the movie.<br/><br/>The effects people and the art and visual designers really knocked my socks off. One of the problems with computer-generated imagery and motion capture movies is the sterility of the \"sets\" and the lack of grounding of the characters in the world they're supposed to be inhabiting. When real people walk the real ground, they affect the ground - when cartoon characters walk on the ground, there's no disturbance. \"Avatar\" gets around this in part by having a world that is phosphorescent, so when the characters step on things, the things glow. In other scenes, however, the computer-generated characters float on the ground without interacting with it. There's no real feedback from the environment to the characters.<br/><br/>The visuals were compelling - I got a little motion sick from some scenes, just as I would have in real life. The 3D camera work really works - I felt some of the objects were definitely in front of the movie screen - and Cameron didn't play it for cheap thrills. (They were very expensive thrills.) I think \"Avatar\" is a major step forward in motion picture production, comparable to the coming of sound and color.<br/><br/>There are, of course, problems. Motion capture means we see computer-generated characters. Whether you care about what is basically a cartoon is not something I can predict. I don't foresee motion capture as a wave of the future, but that may be a reflection of my generation rather than an accurate forecast. My habit has been to see and care about characters played by Jimmy Stewart, Humphrey Bogart, Morton Downey, Jr., George Clooney; Meryl Streep, Audrey Hepburn, Tilda Swinton, Ingrid Bergman.<br/><br/>Additionally, the bad guys were so overdone they left me vaguely sick. There were no redeeming virtues - the bad guys were bad all the way through. We had no background that gave us reasons; we had no internal struggles with what would have been right. I'd contrast these cartoons with Heath Ledger's The Joker in \"The Dark Knight.\" His character was fully developed, and we understood his evil and felt sorry for him. In \"Avatar,\" Quaritch and Selfridge had no depth.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the world Cameron created and the story worked for me. I think, though, that seeing it in 3D Imax made a significant difference from watching in 2D. I recommend seeing the film in 3D if at all possible. I think the 3D Imax effects cover up a lot of sins.<br/><br/>NOTES ABOUT IDEOLOGY AND SOME American OBJECTIONS. SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Some Americans see this movie as anti-American, anti-capitalism, and anti-religion. While I'll lend some credence to those points of view, they're overblown. I've read about pre-literate humans and their rituals for thanking the animals for sacrificing their lives so that the humans might eat them, and the aliens in \"Avatar\" have this same ritual. I think having it here helps establish the world of the aliens and connects me to it: their world is the world of our Stone Age ancestors, where everything is connected and life is lived among creatures who have a right to exist. This is the basis for the objection to taking the minerals from the planet. It all has a right to exist. <br/><br/>By casting the villain as corporation with military muscle, Cameron picked an obvious target. He did it badly, though, and that's my objection. It's possible to read the movie as a rant against the rape of our planet. It's possible to read the assault on a Stone Age populace as an attack on American military ventures in the Middle East. It's possible to see the exposition of the alien \"religion\" as an attack on American monotheism. I though it was just a movie with good action and great special effects. It wasn't good enough for me to take seriously as a metaphor for anything. From my point of view, the people who were offended by the movie tell me more about themselves than they do about the movie. Your mileage will vary.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar - Avatar is James Cameron's much awaited epic - the likes of which has not been seen in several years. It's great to know that something this long in the making was actually worth the wait. Jake (Sam Worthington) is a marine sent to replace his twin brother in a mission on an enemy planet. Jake is uploaded into an \"Avatar\", a genetic copy of the Na'vi the alien race he is to infiltrate. Jake's loyalties are put to the test.<br/><br/>Avatar reinforces why certain ideas, now scathingly called cliché in the first place, are still so potent in the collective unconsciousness. The problem with so many films that tried and failed to utilize similar themes, is they have lacked the emotional maturity and depth of Avatar. The mere fact that Avatar succeeds so well indicates the truth of it's message. Is Jake going to convert? Of course he is. A relatable realistic portrayal of Jake by Sam Worthington makes us believe this. Who wouldn't want to fly? Who wouldn't want to see so much simple natural beauty and trade it in a heartbeat for their mechanized, false environment? One of the things I liked with that Jake's defection was not just for the sake of his co-star Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), who is played with vitality and heart.<br/><br/>There is great work form the ensemble. Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore all give quality work as the good guys. Stephen Lang plays the badass villain Colonel Miles Quaritch, while Giovanni Ribisi plays a scummy corporate shill.<br/><br/>The aesthetics and scope of the film are incredible. Whether it is seen in 3-D or not the film is a work of art. The planet is gorgeous from head to toe. Its destruction is a painful reminder of the Amazon Rainforest. Some of the creatures resemble underwater creatures, whilst others bear resemblance to the conquered by nature dinosaurs. The Na'vi are a subtle mix of various conquered peoples through history. Part Indian in bone structure, part African. And who took these people by storm in the first place you ask? It is a look into the other side's shoes that Avatar provides. We haven't been the good guys for a long time guys. I love my troops for their sacrifices, but I feel that these are very much the wrong wars.<br/><br/>The film succeeds at being preachy by diving in with it's heart on it's sleeve. The message isn't tacked on: We are the assholes when we go forth with our worst instincts for cruelty and greed. The message is strengthened by a millenia of history. The film jogs it's viewers over to the side of peace and naturalism and has them rejecting corporate greed and military strong-arming in the course of three hours. If that's not a testament to the amazing power of correctly done film than I'm not sure what is.<br/><br/>My tiny problem is the choice of the name for the precious metal the Earthers desire so badly: unobtainium. Yeesh. C'mon guys. How about a little subtlety for audience members over the age of 12? How about \"nofindium\" or \"macguffium\". In such a well crafted film, this feels like a first draft problem everyone was too deeply involved on the project to feel like changing.<br/><br/>Several sites indicate that two sequels are in the works. My initial response was a groan, as I thought this was a great stand-alone film that needed no further examination, but this is James Cameron the master of sequels we're talking about here. I'm sure this will bear amazing children for the years to come.<br/><br/>2009 was a sorry year in many respects, but film was not one of them. Virtually all of the films I deeply enjoyed for using their brains, brawn and wit were financial successes. Perhaps the mass appetite/recognition for quality has not been diminished, only starved in the past few years. Maybe there is hope after all. If we're going to survive, we'll need intelligence, artistry, and ecological conscientiousness, whether we like it or not.<br/><br/>Avatar gets an A.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Without doubt the most hyped and publicly marketed film in the history of contemporary cinema, Avatar has since dominated the big screen in all corners of the world, going on to generate over $2.7 billion in revenue and giving director James Cameron the highly- respectable title of having been at the helm of both the most, and second-most, financially successful cinematic endeavours of all time. <br/><br/>Avatar takes us more than one hundred years into the future, where the Earth (played by the United States) sends a group of Marines to mine the foreign planet of Pandora for an extremely rare MacGuffin known as Unobtainium. Involved in this operation is the crippled Jake Sully, who is given the task of fusing his body with a cloned native in order to gain the trust of the planet's Indigenous population, the Na'vi, and convince them to flee their home in to accommodate the excavation of their sacred site. Along the way, Jake becomes more than friendly with the Na'vi princess Neytiri and begins to question the underlying motives of his employer.<br/><br/>For many cinema goers, this film offered a comprehensively positive answer to the most debatable of movie topics: can a film made with the budget of a small (or, in this case, not- so-small) country which is made to appeal to the masses also be embraced by the critical community?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I'm not one of those believers. For pre-hype about Avatar to include such claims as 'it will revolutionise the way people watch and interpret cinema', it's fair to say expectations were pretty high. I walked into the film expecting a heavy dose of originality to complement the many socially conscious themes suggested by trailers, and ultimately implicated in the film's plot (including a criticism of America's involvement in the occupation of Iraq, as well as the need for us all to make our thumbs a little greener).<br/><br/>What I got was same-old, same-old, Hollywood production-line stuff. A plot recreated dozens of times in different environments, coupled with a 'romantic' sub-plot lacking any sense of depth meant this was 'just another movie' in my eyes. I'm always open to give two thumbs up for innovation in film and, quite frankly, would have had no problem in seeing the closing credits roll following Jake's refreshingly insightful monologue about how 'we all have to wake up sometime.'<br/><br/>Of course, the film dragged on for another 45 minutes, climaxing in a fierce battle scene allowing the special effects crew to show off to their heart's content, which was, that's right, thrown in to appeal to the masses.<br/><br/>Despite this, I am impartially obliged to list three positives to come out of what was otherwise a disappointing film. Sam Worthington's portrayal of Jake Sully was, while by no means Oscar-worthy, leaps and bounds ahead of his previous enterprise in the dreadful Terminator: Salvation. The attention to detail offered in terms of the mannerisms of a paraplegic was something I was worried would be pushed to one side in the scope of such a grand undertaking, but Worthington did the role justice.<br/><br/>Secondly, Avatar has given 3D cinema the push it needed to avoid being just some flavour- of-the-month promotion, and I for one am glad to see it hang around. Avatar is the first, and by no means the last, blockbuster to accommodate this revolution in filmmaking. And speaking of revolution, no one can voice their opinion on Avatar without mentioning the visuals. Not since our encounter with a real-life T-rex in Spielberg's suspenseful 1993 roller-coaster have computer-generated effects taken such a huge step forward. Now if only JC and company could have formed the plot, character development and dialogue to match.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Of course I had heard the hype over Avatar for a long time, but just refused to believe it for many reasons. It seemed very overrated at first glance, as it probably did to most, and I really didn't care to see if for awhile. Now, I am so glad that I gave it a chance, because Avatar turned out to be a visually beautiful, incredibly written and wonderfully executed work of art that indeed is my favorite movie of 2009 and one of the best movies I've ever seen, and that's without me viewing it in 3D!<br/><br/>First of all, yes, it does seem overrated at first glance. Even when the film started my thoughts were that it had pretty bad dialogue and that it was going to be incredibly crappy and a complete waste of my time. I changed that thought within the first twenty or twenty-five minutes of the movie. It begins to get so interesting and the characters start making an unbelievable impact on you and you really start to care for them and the story, within the first twenty or twenty-five minutes, I don't lie. It starts becoming more and more entertaining until you are completely mesmerized and astonished by how wonderful it truly is and how entranced you are in the film and how alluring it is to all your senses.<br/><br/>The movie is amazingly brilliant and even though it was long, I was taking in every second with the utmost delight because James Cameron makes it so enjoyable to watch and has a direction that creates the most pleasurable and sensational atmosphere, as he's done with every movie I've seen by him. The actors and actresses capture their characters superbly as well and make them really believable and likable down to the very core. Sure, the movie didn't bring that much new material, but the way they handled it so delicately is what really pays off and makes the viewer tantalize every aspect.<br/><br/>I thought the suspense, romance, action and all other genre mixes were balanced perfectly, and though the plot was paper thin, it was strong because of how amazingly beautiful the visuals were and how powerfully the actors and actresses make their characters, and how well the CGI makes it seem like you are actually on the planet Pandora and living every second of the film. Simply fantastic, I must say!<br/><br/>Well, people who think it is still overrated after seeing it have probably disagreed with this by now, but if you are a fan of Avatar and appreciated it for the astonishingly magnificent piece of work that it is, I am right there with you. It was exciting and riveting to the bone with CGI and lush, picturesque scenes that are to die for. The plot was well done because of how wonderful every one that worked on the film makes it be and the movie was entertaining as hell. I am proud to say I enjoyed it highly and that James Cameron deserves all the money he received for this marvelous movie. After it was off, I wish it would've never ended.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's basically Fern Gully the live action remake, starring giant smurf native Americans.<br/><br/>I saw it in 3D when it came out, which would have been more impressive if I hadn't already seen Monsters vs Aliens in 3D.<br/><br/>Novelty 3D in the cinema release aside, there's nothing to recommend this (seeming) 9 hour movie.<br/><br/>Also it has about 3 different points where I went, 'oh that's the end of the film... No, wait, it's still going.' After l thought the movie had reached a conclusion or climax, I thought it again after another 15 or 20 minutes, and then again, and then I think again, for an hour after I first thought the movie was about to end.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">So this is what all the year-log hype has been about. This is Avatar. This is the Next Big Leap in film-making. Like Star Wars, and The Abyss, and Jurassic Park, and The Matrix, this is the next generation of special effects and science fiction.<br/><br/>I have to be honest: it is a wonderful cinematic experience. The visuals are spectacular, the animation is nearly flawless. This is a movie almost entirely composed of CGI animation. This is indeed a great leap forward in technology, and (being a big fan of animation), I was in awe of the technical achievement. By itself, it's almost enough to carry the film.<br/><br/>I say \"almost\" because, unfortunately, the film lacks so many fundamentals that have been around since the time of William Shakespeare, fundamentals that, if applied, could have made Avatar a masterpiece instead of a pre-teen Disney flick with stunning visuals.<br/><br/>I'm talking primarily about plot, story, and connection. This is a weak plot, told so many times before you can guess every beat before it happens. You've got a primitive, happy, nature-connected tribe; you've got evil corporations intent on despoilment for profit; you've got their military dogs led by a grizzled Marine vet with anger management issues; you've got scientist-pacifists as their unknown collaborators. Then there's the epic, underdog struggle against a stronger foe solved by a singular plot twist and/or deus ex machina; and the happy tearful ending.<br/><br/>I think what happened is James Cameron had this big CGI vision for this film, but he couldn't invest time or effort on a unique story. Perhaps this is just the way it had to be to make this great technical leap: grab together a simple story told a hundred times before, and use all your effort and energy in design and animation. Perhaps, in the future, we'll see an Oscar-worthy original screenplay told in a CGI universe. Avatar certainly isn't it.<br/><br/>I will spike out the soundtrack specifically in this review. It is AWFUL!! You know what this soundtrack is? It's a conglomeration of music used in Lion King, Pocahantas, and other Disney films. There isn't anything interesting or unique about it, and that's a terrible tragedy. Here we have a new visual experience, and to not couple it with an original, creative, special soundtrack is a damned shame.<br/><br/>I'm still giving it an 8, because it is so stunning it's enjoyable. And I always \"mark up\" according to level of difficulty.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">So how to make a film that keeps cinemas open through the recession? Use new technology, and make sure the story works all over the world. The 3D is of course the only point of this release. It is a mark in the sand. There is no throwing things in your face 3D here - just giving an extra depth to a new world.<br/><br/>I see people asking \"Why does Avatar make marines bad?\" Its because this film must pull its weight around the world - and retelling the invasion myth of America with different winners appeals to world opinion in this particular time with unethical wars appear to be the fault of America.<br/><br/>But appealing to world taste may have gone awry here. This film seems to place itself about two decades backwards in film chronology. It isn't just using Signourey Weaver that signals this. Blade Runner was 1982. Aliens was 1986. Dances with Wolves was 1990. The Matrix, 1999, looks clearly advanced in ideas compared to the sub L. Ron Hubbard rubbish that Avatar develops. Compare \"World tree\" to \"We are all Avatars unless we unplug\".<br/><br/>I thought Lord of the Rings achieved something with a real myth retold strongly in a modern idiom. Avatar seems more applicable to a Dr Who episode from time gone by.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I did not enjoy this as much as I did a while ago in the theaters. I rewatched it recently, and I realized that most of my enjoyment the first time was the hype it was receiving as one of the most grossing films of the year and decade, not to mention it's a 17 year project. If you think about it in the Duke Nukem Forever sense, that its been built up all this time so we should expect more and be disappointed, then you'll most likely be disappointed. It's the standard Dances with Wolves/Pocahontas setup with blue cats in the mix. If you have zero expectations, then you'll enjoy it more. Me, I was expecting better for sure, but it gets buy, sorta.<br/><br/>The protagonist is John Smith...no, Jake Sully, my bad. Either way, he's going to try and help the blue cats on their planet called Pandora. He forms his own Avatar of a blue cat and becomes a member of their tribe, learning their ways and wits, while also getting it on with Pocahontas, (clears throat) Neytiri.<br/><br/>The characters are all clichés, the military bad guy who wants harvest as much as possible from nature, but oh no we the people say you have no right to deprive them of their home. The story is so formulaic. It has little surprises here and there, but I predicted the whole thing.<br/><br/>The film is still enjoying to watch regardless, for a different reason. To me, the enjoyment doesn't come from the writing, characters, or story, cause that'll get you nowhere. The enjoyment comes from the technicals of the film. The cinematography, visuals, scenery, and action are all FANTASTIC!! I was blown away by how good this movie looks. The colors, the clearness, everything about it is just stunning, especially in blu ray. I must sound like a Michael Bay fan saying the visuals are better than the story, but honestly, that's all I was enjoying about it.<br/><br/>If you're expecting a phenomenon to change filmmaking forever, you won't find it here, it's a sloppy story with sloppy writing and clichéd characters. But man oh man it looks stunning, probably one of the best looking movies I've ever seen. It's entertaining for the most part, so if that's enough for you, then I recommend it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar was the best film experience I have had in a theater. I am a huge film buff, and would not ordinarily find myself shortlisting the biggest movie of the year for such a distinction, but for this I am making an exception. The film is not perfect, faltering in areas of writing and some acting, but as a cinematic experience it will remain unparalleled for years to come.<br/><br/>The innovation in technology, particularly the RealD experience, was instrumental to the films power (I watched it in all three 3D systems - Dolby, IMAX and RealD - and found RealD to be the cleanest, least blurry, brightest and most immersive version of the film). A lot of this was nothing new - 3D had been employed successfully earlier that year with Pixar's 'Up' - and yet there is a sense when watching Avatar that you are watching the birth of a new kind of cinema.<br/><br/>Part of this is how the technology is used in aid to the storytelling - instead of using 3D in gimmicky ways, it's Cameron's story that subtly eases us into the third dimension. Experiencing this transition from half an hour of monochromatic, nearly flat imagery into the world of Pandora is like falling asleep in this world to wake up in the middle of one of your most fantastic and memorable dreams. Yes, it is that powerful.<br/><br/>Where Cameron's script falters in the micro sense (cliche grunt talk, cliche executive villain, and I hated that Sigourney Weaver's Grace was smoking cigarettes in a space station), it's made up for the same way he's made his other films work. Yes, it is an awesome visual and action-packed feast - but there is real humanity in the storytelling. I am convinced that without it, his films wouldn't work. He reaches for something mythic, about destinies colliding and heroes being born; about love and fate; femininity and masculinity together - if you allow yourself to drop the critical mindset for a moment, and go with it, it hits on all of these levels at once. That is a rare treat, and that is why Cameron has consistently made the most successful films, ever.<br/><br/>Aside from this, there is very little I can say. If you missed seeing this in the theater, in 3D - you've missed the boat. I wouldn't really want to see this again on a smaller screen. And I would recommend to somebody who hasn't seen it - to wait until they re-release Avatar in theaters, even if it's ten years from now, it was designed to be seen in 3D - on a big screen- and that is how it should be experienced. Like a ride at an amusement park - pay the ticket and see it for real.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'm really glad James Cameron took his time perfecting this masterpiece. Oh, sure it has lots of PC politics ad nauseam, but the moral ground it stands on is firm, let's face it. Sure it demonizes humans as imperialists and murderers of indigenous peoples and the ecosystem, but there's plenty of real guilt to go around there too. But I don't care. I don't get my political views from Hollywood directors, especially one who already has egg all over his face because he thought he found Jesus' bones in a box. The cinematic fact remains that this film is not only eye-popping (especially in 3D!) but compelling as a human drama, and very well acted (even by the cgi characters!). I highly recommend that everyone see this in 3D. It uses the 3D aspect seamlessly and unobtrusively, but it really enhances the storytelling.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It clear that the only reason people went out to see avatar is because of its ground breaking technology. The film in the visual department does not disappoint . The scenery is fantastic and the 3D is great. But there is a downside , after 30 minutes of seeing the effects , you kind of lose interest. Now and then something will \"wow\" you but that about it. The script does not help the film in anyway. It has only been written as a template to show off these effects and nothing else. The story is weak and been told many times before and the characters didn't connect with me. Before I watched Avatar , I heard about the story being similar to other films . I didn't mind this as films are made to be a visual experience and seeing that this is new high technology equipment that Cameron used I surely thought that would be enough to carry me through the film. <br/><br/>Apart from the script , there's nothing negative about the film. At the end of the day it goes down to how spectacular the film is. Cameron wanted this film to excite people and it certainly did but just not me. It seems Cameron doesn't care about using his writing abilities anymore and only thinks about the technical side of the industry which is a shame because Cameron can write amazing stories such as The Terminator's films. But you can't blame him for getting everyone out of the house to watch this film. Many people will be interested on how he did it and plus it all good for the cinema world. Should it win the best picture at the Oscars? I would say yes due to the amount of work that has been put into it and how Cameron is trying to reinvent the way we watch films. <br/><br/>Personally , I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. My reason being because a film that is categorised as a masterpiece has to stand the test of time. What will happen when all films uses this sort of technology? Avatar maybe the first but when everyone gets there hands on it, other films will start to outclass it. For the cinematic experience , it wasn't greater than the lord of the rings trilogy. You could feel the atmosphere , not only on the screen but all around you in the theatre. Avatar failed to capture that feeling personally. <br/><br/>Well Avatar is a good film , it not and will never be a classic to me. I didn't leave me with tons to say after I watched it as it wasn't that good of a film. Tell me, how long can you have a discussion on Avatar before running out of things to say? Not long I bet. Take the 3D away and it leaves you dry</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The plot is stolen from many different movies, there was only 3 good actors, the characters are either bland or stereotypical, and yet it made almost 3 billion. When I think a film is overrated I usually like it. I don't think of it as Oscar worthy, but I like it. Then there is Avatar a film I not only think is the most overrated film in history, but also on its own without the hype a terrible movie. It didn't have any effort put into the story at all. Star Wars took the ideas of many movies together to create something epic, but Avatar takes instead of being inspired by these things is just being lazy by stealing the ideas. It is an awful movie, but people and critics liked it. Why is that? Well that is due to the effects. Few watching, or reviewing cared about what the story was. All they cared about was the effects. Yes the effects and 3-D are great, but without the substance of a well written story it fails. I don't care if the effects are the best ever. Giving this film a good review based of the effects is like walking to your computer, and staring at the screensaver. You think it looks cool so you look at it. Next time you look up it is 3 hours later. Would consider that a good way to spend your time. No you would not, but you think that Avatar is worth your time. This a movie that is destroying filmmaking.<br/><br/>1 star out of 4</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron has always done great films and this is no exception, the best Computer Generated Effects I've ever seen, the 3D look was magnificent, the performances are so wonderful that it made me excited with joy, especially weaver's performance, one of her since Gorillas in the mist back in 1988 and I Saw that wonderful film, A Man goes into the village where he meets blue creatures and other great stuff, great musical score, the writing is crisp, the editing is great, the screenplay is one of the best I've ever seen, the action is also great, great suspense and everything else, i'm glad most critics and audiences enjoyed this as much as I Did, because it shows you the warmth and heart of a great film and this has got to be it, this is something that james cameron did it right with avatar that raja gosnell with the smurfs did it all wrong, yes it was a film about blue creatures, but it didn't have the charm that the comic strip nor the cartoon had and it certainly doesn't have the charm that this movie had, this is simply one of the best films of all time and I Hope to see this one again very soon, I Can't wait for the avatar sequels.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Jake Sully is dispatched to the planet Pandora, he is a disabled marine who luckily is his brother's twin, so he can take part in Avatar program. A program were human's take on grown bodies, part human, part N'aavi (The natives of Pandora) in an effort to interact with and convince the natives it's okay to plunder the planet. As a marine Jake is wooed, coerced, by Major bad-guy to sell out the N'aavi so the humans can do what they want but things don't go quite to plan as the Avatar world becomes more real than the real one.<br/><br/>Apparently James Cameron spent years and years on the technology to bring Avatar to life, but a little less time on the script (Unobtanium? Come on, why not call it hard-to-get-at-ite or virtually-none-of-ix) and after the first fifteen minutes you kind of get sign posted to how the movie will go, after all Hollywood doesn't spend $300 million dollars on a movie that's not predictable, right? So, yes, it's predictable, yes the scripts got holes in it ...BUT, the million dollar question is, is it any good. Well, in spite of these things, yes it is.<br/><br/>It is corny as hell and some of the effects, most notably when Jake is first running about in his Avatar body, aren't brilliant for a film that's had this much spent on it. Also some of the big gun-ships don't look like they would be physically able to fly and these are some of the minor niggles that almost pulled me out of the movie.<br/><br/>That said it is fantastic fun, James Cameron has attempted to carve out of the sci-fi niche, in terms of scale, a film on a level with Frank Herbert's Duen, and although he is no Frank Herbert in terms of writing, as a film-maker he is a master of his craft and you do get taken into this world. Sat there you feel for the N'aavi, and you do feel some remorse for the past sins of generations who wiped out the Native Americans and have seen the Aborigini's also decline. If the film was not successful we would not feel this, it is testament to him that we do.<br/><br/>Where will it all end. Well, more studios will pump money into predictable 3D blockbusters and will see them fail because they don't get that you need more than a few life lessons, big CGI and dots on people's motion capture faces to make a good film, but that takes nothing away from this. It is great fun. It should be seen at the pictures and like the title says, it is predicable, but spectacular!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">After about a hour or so I got this feeling that the story line reminded me of something, a tribe of aboriginals, living in paradise type surroundings, outside boy meets tribe girl, and the bad dudes are the white race! I did not spot Kevin Costner but I just kept thinking the story line is so much like Dances with wolves! There is nothing new when it comes to the story line, hence my score of 8 out of 10. Sure the special effects are top notch, the decor is very colorful, but I felt like I was watching a remake of some kind, nothing was a real surprise, I wanted something new, sure it looked great, but I kept thinking when I get to see the wolf.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Great, great film, but much advertised. The plot is compelling and the special effects are incredible, you see that James Cameron has spent a lot of dollars. This film certainly wins the 'Oscar Oscar or more, the work was excellent. James Cameron developed that great film called Titanic, very unfairly hated this site and the legendary Terminator. I find it very psychological and emotional in his film, even the settings I found extraordinary, including extraterrestrial environments and animals. The success of the awards will be assured, even if the inconsistencies are present as the men who walk while an airplane is in motion, American mistakes.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's unwatchable AVATAR for the first time - especially when it was released - without being influenced by all the hype, with countless critics, fans, and reviewers lauding it as a match FX film, a film ushering in a new era of cinematic freak show, the best movie of all time, and etc. Such praise always makes me feel chilly, which is why I saw this movie for the first time on the theater.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">'Avatar' is loud and colourful. You get plenty of noise for your money and your eyes will be overloaded by stimuli. Visually, it's gorgeous. Graphics are smooth and elegant.<br/><br/>The 3D is a mixed bag; it seems to fade in and out. Scenes with real actors look best; scenes with a predominance of CGI vary in quality.<br/><br/>This is not ground-breaking, history-making stuff. It's just vanilla 3D with chocolate sauce, in need of some more beta testing.<br/><br/>The CGI tended to disassociate me from the Na'vi (the blue space monkeys who inhabit Pandora).<br/><br/>While I enjoyed the switch between Jake's two 'worlds', the CGI stuff never felt real and the graphics used to create them seem a trifle cartoonish. <br/><br/>Consequently, Avatar looks like it's been pasted together with screencaps from a sophisticated MMORPG. <br/><br/>Sadly, the strongest characters are all heterosexual and enjoy freedom to choose their own destiny, while the gay and lesbian characters are consistently disempowered.<br/><br/>The Na'vi are shamelessly characterised via the classic 'noble savage' stereotype, and consequently I couldn't give a toss about their fate.<br/><br/>A mixture of Native Americans and African Americans (two peoples enslaved and abused by white Americans, ironically) they are so dumb and hippyish that I couldn't take them seriously.<br/><br/>During the rare times when they're not babbling pseudo-mystical nonsense at the humans, they play 'cowboys and Indians' with each other and hang around looking moody.<br/><br/>They have no idea how to mobilise themselves against the humans. It takes Jake (a 'Great White Chief from the Skies') to unite the clans and get them doing what they should have been doing since before the movie even started.<br/><br/>Only Jake can do this because--having spent all of several weeks on Pandora--he has magically become a complete expert in every aspect of their language, culture, society, politics and history. And how? Because he's a white American. Yes it's 'Dances with Wolves' on an alien planet. Huzzah! <br/><br/>Avatar is replete with heavy overtones of cultural imperialism and white supremacy. The movie bizarrely subverts itself by embracing these concepts for the sake of the increasingly ridiculous plot.<br/><br/>There is nothing egalitarian or Na'vi-esque about Jake's rise to power amongst the Na'vi. He's just the biggest kid on the block with the biggest weapon and the smartest mouth.<br/><br/>He's the Great White Chief from the Skies who has to lead the noble savages to glory because they're not smart enough to do it by themselves. He's able to bond with the Toruk despite the fact that he's not even a real Na'vi and has only been on the planet a few weeks.<br/><br/>Jake civilises the Na'vi by introducing human constructs to their society and empowers them by providing human technology. He is a Lawrence of Arabia for blue space monkeys. After all the 'nasty humans hurting lovely natives' business, the Na'vi ultimately find salvation in the very race which attacks them. Subtext: white men rule, OK? <br/><br/>Jake accomplishes a 'once in a lifetime' feat which only five of the clan's greatest Na'vi have ever achieved in the entire history of Pandora. He then leads his new people to war, having become more of a noble savage than the noble savages themselves.<br/><br/>Which we knew he was going to do because the movie blatantly telegraphed it at least an hour beforehand. As it did with all of the plot's crude developments.<br/><br/>Movies based on stereotypical plot elements and stereotypical characters are horribly predictable because everyone already knows what to expect from the stereotypes.<br/><br/>Avatar slavishly adheres to this tired old formula which is why the story just isn't very interesting. It wastes new technology on old cheese.<br/><br/>Some have suggested Jake is successful because he has a different outlook to the Na'vi (e.g. more pragmatic and ruthless), and inside information about the humans' plans. But is this correct?<br/><br/>The Na'vi are already pragmatic and ruthless. They're not all sitting around in communes smoking weed. They attack humans on sight (not to mention each other), hence the need for the Avatars. The only 'different outlook' that Jake has is the one he steadily loses throughout the course of the movie!<br/><br/>Is Jake's 'inside information' a deal-breaker? Nope.<br/><br/>The humans already know where the Na'vi clan are living (Sigourney Weaver's character has been running a school there, remember?) <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver's character also knows the humans are straining at the leash and might attack at any moment; she could have told them this herself.<br/><br/>From the moment the first bulldozer tries to roll over Jake, it is obvious to everyone that the humans are heading for the tree.<br/><br/>So what exactly did Jake tell people that they didn't already know or couldn't have figured out for themselves? Nothing that I can see. It's just weak scriptwriting.<br/><br/>Some characterisation is quite good. The Muslim scientist guy is a case in point. Sigourney Weaver plays the lesbian doctor convincingly. But it's not enough to rescue this stinker.<br/><br/>I've barely touched on the plot holes. Examples could be multiplied. There were also some dizzying leaps of logic.<br/><br/>I was checking my watch at the 90 minute mark, yawning after 2 hours and wishing I could grow a third buttock for extra coccyx support by the time we entered the final 20 minutes.<br/><br/>That's when I wasn't laughing loudly at the atrocious acting and cringe-worthy dialogue.<br/><br/>In fact there were quite a lot of laughs in the cinema, and when the movie finally ended everyone just sort of shrugged and walked out. Like me, they were simply glad it was over.<br/><br/>I rate 'Avatar' at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out at a solid 5/10 on IMDb.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">(www.plasticpals.com) I wasn't really sure what to expect of Avatar. I knew Cameron would deliver, but I wasn't sure in what way or to what extent. In case you're wondering, Avatar does deliver – in spades. See it as soon as possible, that's all you really need to know. Still, I feel like I owe it to the film to write a bit more. Earlier I said that Avatar always seemed like \"that movie Cameron had to finish before doing Battle Angel\". Boy was I wrong. Not that there are many bad reviews out there, but honestly those critics can go expletive deleted themselves.<br/><br/>Avatar blew my mind. I haven't felt like this since I saw Jurassic Park as a kid, which is probably why the word \"breakthrough\" is making the rounds. This is the feeling of the bar being raised. A couple of trailers precede the film – Clash of the Titans, an epic visual effects action film, looks laughable by comparison. And Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (which from the trailer is probably Burton's most beautiful film to date) can't match it.<br/><br/>This is easily, I repeat easily the most visually stunning film I have ever seen. More so than any other film, I felt like I was transported to a different world, as if I was inside of a dream. And it's not just due to the 3d effect, which is so natural you will soon forget it is there, but the seamless blend of live action and special effects. In some scenes the exotic flora and fauna are displayed in all their glory in slow motion so you can really savor the details. The best special effects artists in the industry clearly believed in the project and gave it their all.<br/><br/>The performances the world-class animators at Weta wrought from the Na'vi are just as nuanced and convincing as the best scenes with Gollum from Lord of the Rings. Though the Na'vi look more alien than Gollum their emotions come through, quite powerfully at times, and you will feel for them. The subtle hint of the actors they were based on gives them that extra believability, particularly with Sam Worthington's character. Neytiri, the lithe female Na'vi (to the credit of the artists) will make you a furry for the duration of the film, and you won't mind. You will wish that the beautiful but dangerous planet of Pandora was a real place; the proud indigenous Na'vi a real people. Digital characters have come a verrrrrry long way from Jar Jar Binks indeed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the story is not as groundbreaking as the visuals. They say there are no truly unique ideas left in the world, and it is easy to point out similarities to plots or ideas seen in other epic films. And it's true that the third act is pretty much balls-out action. That said, I was so swept away in what I was seeing that I could hardly care. The difference here is that this has James Cameron's signature all over it: he gets your adrenaline pumping scene after scene with hardly a chance to breathe, and somehow manages to weave it all together into a touching story with a deafening message.<br/><br/>Everyone needs to get out and see this. Not for its story, nor for any particular visual effect, or for its use of groundbreaking 3d technology. You need to see this because the King of the World has come back from his long hiatus and brought back something truly spectacular. Unlike Lucas, Cameron hasn't lost his touch. Bring on Battle Angel, your highness, but if you want to revisit Pandora I'll gladly come along for another ride.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This really could have been something special. Influential director James Cameron's first film since the mega-hit 'Titanic'. 12 years of waiting, in part so that the technology was advanced enough for the film to be made. The man who gave us Sci-Fi classics like 'The Terminator', 'T2: Judgement Day' and 'Aliens' giving us his most ambitious piece yet. But for all its visual grandeur, its technical marvel, its fine detail, Avatar ends up being a disheartening failure. Why? Because it makes the fatal mistake of completely ignoring the two things that are crucial in any film, story and character.<br/><br/>The film follows paraplegic marine Jake Sully as he takes the place of his deceased brother on the avatar project. Based on the distant planet Pandora, the project involves controlling a body of the natives (known as the Na'vi) in order to gather information about them. Well so far so good, there's at least some creativity. All that disappears quickly. We learn that the military and business tycoons are there to take a valuable material called Unobtainium (oh how do they come up with this stuff). I'm so sick of these lazy plots that have suits taking what isn't there's. We get the message they're hammering us with, leave the indigenous people and their land alone. Of course Jake is persuaded by Colonel Quaritch to deliver information and secrets about the Na'vi directly to him so he can figure out their weakness in exchange for the spinal surgery Jake needs.<br/><br/>But wait a second, something incredible happens. The more time Jake absorbs the Na'vi's culture, the more he grows to love its people and begins to doubt whether or not he can turn on them. Well I've never seen that before. Oh wait, I have in 'Dances with Wolves', 'Pocahontas' and 'The Last Samurai' to name but a few. It is exactly the same story as all of these. It has the same set-up, it follows the same beats, it has the same character motivations, and it even has the same preachy moral lesson. The white man comes to conquer, but the main character can't fight against the culture he initially dislikes but grows to care for. There is not a single moment in the film where I didn't know what was going to happen next. For all the money spent why couldn't they write a better story?<br/><br/>Throughout all this Jake develops a relationship with a Na'vi called Neytiri and it is literally there just to serve the plot. These two share absolutely no chemistry. There isn't even a reason for them to like each other. The only reason Neytiri changes her mind is because some kind of sprite lands on him and that's a sign that he has a good heart. Sadly the film is littered with convenient and mystical hogwash like that which is never looked at in any detail. It's fair enough that the film has its own mythology, but at least try to give some meaning. The film suffers badly from lack of explanation. Like why are the military so fixed on destroying the planet to gain the material when it's clear that the Na'vi can be befriended with relative ease? It is basically because we need some villains and those mean humans will do just fine. <br/><br/>The only thing as one-note as the story are the characters. Sam Worthington's agent deserves a medal for getting one of the blandest, most expressionless, cardboard cut-out actors ever to grace the screen to helm a film of this magnitude. It boggles my mind as to how insipid an actor he is. Jake as a character isn't very interesting but there are countless actors who could of at least brought something to the role. Zoe Saldana suffers too, but that's mainly because Neytiri is a totally unlikeable and irritating character. You even have good actors like Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang wasted in clichéd roles as the plucky scientist and the colonel blinded by stupidity. In a film like this we need characters that are either relatable or interesting in order to keep them from being swamped. You'd think Cameron of all people would know this. <br/><br/>What I can't discount is just how visually stunning the film is. The world created is something we've seen before, but the detail and vibrancy really is something to behold. This film is gorgeous. The textures, the colour scheme, the shades of light, the environment of Pandora, it all looks pretty incredible and I can see why it took so long to craft. The CGI both stands out on its own and blends with the live-action seamlessly. The Na'vi's design is a bit conventional, but again the detail gone into creating them is there for all to see. The visuals truly are the films only outstanding feature. The same can't be said of the action sequences even though they're are decently staged and can get suitably intense, they're nowhere near as imaginative or gripping as they could have been. That's partly because you don't care who lives or dies.<br/><br/>James Cameron did something here that I struggle to understand. He made a film with such creative potential and possibilities safe. Something that is a boring and hollow experience. Something that is so reliant on its visual brilliance that without it there is nothing to offer. How could someone as talented as Cameron create a story that is so cliché riddled and unengaging? In many ways the film's success is disappointing. It's telling filmmakers that we want more films where the stories and characters can be as basic as possible as long as we get some impressive visuals, where we value style over substance. I want style, but I also want a film that I can be invested in and where I care about what happens. Avatar failed to provide this on any level.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I honestly don't know what people see in this movie. The story is lame, the acting is poor and the message of \"humans are greedy murderers\" is old and overused. Yes, the special effects are pretty good...but so are most movies these days. I think the only reason this movie gets such good ratings is because they try to connect greedy humans with unrestrained capitalism...which seems to be Hollywood's big push, lately. I find this concept completely unrealistic and overly simplified. I give it a few stars for the special effects...but overall this movie is conceptually boring and intellectually irritating.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I'm not going to make this out to be one of the best films ever created or going to tell you that all the hype is complete BS. What I will say is that what James Cameron has done in creating Avatar is another step in the evolution of cinema and one hell of a ride. It's an exciting film that takes you to places no film has before. Like many have said, it's the closest you will come to going to another world and a journey well worth taking. But before that, let me get the negatives out of the way.<br/><br/>Firstly, and this seems to be the main complaint, I think the film borrowed too heavily from the stereotype of the noble savage. It's all fine that there is a distinct good and evil between the natives of Pandora and the invading Earthlings, but the film is very cliché when it comes to it's display of the Na'vi. They are very reminiscent of both the Indians and Africans, right down to war cries and bows and arrows. Creating these humanoid aliens is fine, but if Cameron spent so long on this film, he could have at least been a little more creative in his creation of these Na'vi by drastically changing their culture and way of life from anything representative of earth. Still, I suppose people need something to relate to.<br/><br/>To go with this is a story that is every bit as cliché as, say, Dances with Wolves or any other advanced-man-invades-tribal-man's-home story. This story is the same exact thing as any story about any historical invasion of a technologically inferior group of people, be it Indians, African tribes, Mayans and Incans, etc. Sure, it's taken to planetary heights, but it's still the same old universal tale, right down to the cliché fish-out-of-water hero, hardass military badguy, slimy corporate badguy, and heart-of-gold ally who wants to study and save the native people.<br/><br/>That's my biggest gripe with this film. Instead of giving us a film that uses every story cliché about a group of people invading another, Cameron could have created an absolutely different and imaginary world. He could have created a unique story about that world and how vast and radical it is from our own. He could have created creatures that have never been thought of, indigenous people the likes of which we have never seen, and base a unique story around the uniqueness of this new and fascinating world. Instead, we get hybrids of animals from earth, and even hybrids of humanoid cat-creatures that we could call familiar. Hell, the Na'vi even kiss. Would alien's from another planet know what a kiss is? Possibly, I suppose, but it's a good example of a lost opportunity to really go in a very different a radical place with this film, one I would have liked to have seen.<br/><br/>With that being said, I will say that Cameron is forgiven for all transgressions, because this film is all about Pandora.<br/><br/>Every moment spend there (pretty much the entire film) is an absolute joy. It's exciting and had me smiling the entire time. It's like looking at a moving painting you can't watch enough of. There's a great deal of story involved, yes, but that story is deeply rooted into Pandora itself. And that is what saves this film. Cameron has created a world that we could only wish was our own and it will remain one of the greatest environments ever created for a film. Of course we all know about the amazing special effects. And they are 100% amazing. Nothing in this film feels unnatural, something Cameron has become a master at. You will believe that this could happen in the next 200 years.<br/><br/>You may have also heard about the final 40 minutes. And everything you have heard is absolutely correct. This is one of the most exciting war scenes ever created for film. Cameron has directed one of, if not the, best action scenes in a film ever. It's like Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Top Gun, The Loader scene from Aliens, and a ninja movie wrapped up in 40 minutes. It also contains one of the greatest one-on-one showdowns of any film. Simply put, if you see the film for anything, see it for this final 40 minutes. You may think that waiting 2 hours for this final battle wouldn't be worth it. You would be wrong. Firstly because the film isn't as dull as some have made it out to be. And secondly, it is just that good.<br/><br/>Though some have said this won't revolutionize film, I would argue they are wrong. Though the story lacks as great of a script or plot as it could have, and though it doesn't take the whole alien thing far enough in my opinion, the graphics used in this film and the creation of Pandora have opened the door for the creation of anything in film. Any world can be created, any species can be realized. Cameron, who has created some of the greatest action and sci-fi of our time has created yet another phenomenal and important piece of sci-fi.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">So glad The Hurt Locker won Best Picture this year, much more deserving. I couldn't wait to see James Cameron back in action, like a lot of people, but I was really disappointed.<br/><br/>No originality, AT ALL. NONE. Kevin Costner should've gone for a lawsuit, I mean 'Dances with Wolves' was basically the guideline Cameron made while making the movie! The plot was the most ridiculous, so many other stories recycled into this film it was like Frankenstein. Also, 'Unobtanium', or whatever it was called, was the mineral the big bad bad guys were destroying the land for. Cliché, ANYONE? I mean come on, that had to be some kind of joke. Plus, why were the 'evil' humans even after Unobtanium? If it's saving lives back on earth, I'll be honest and say 'Mine Away, Stephen Lang'.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Sam Worthington isn't quite as bad as he was in Terminator Salvation, but he's still stiff as a board and uninteresting as a character. Thank God he was in his CGI Avatar most of the film. Sigourney Weaver is her usual tough broad, not minding lighting up a cigarette in the middle of a presumably gasoline filled complex. The only character that I thought was compelling was Stephen Lang's, and what a Dude he was! Ripped and scarred up, he's a perfect bad guy.<br/><br/>CGI was good, and that was the only reason I gave this a 4 out of 10, Cameron's million's were well spent on creating Pandora.<br/><br/>If you have to see this, go for the visuals and don't mind the giant plot holes.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The special effects are fascinating, but the characters and plot are as trite as they can be. There's no message here that is not present in many Hollywood westerns, or any film concerning imperialist intrusion into a primitive way of life. To sum it up, If Whitey Wants Your Natural Resources, He'll Tear Up Anything To Get Them. From the 15th to the 19th centuries the world learned this lesson from the Spanish, French, Dutch, Portugese, and English. <br/><br/>I laughed out loud when I realized that Giovanni Ribisi's character wasn't kidding when he referred to the object of his mining project as Unobtainium. That word has been used colloquially by motorheads for at least 35 years as a way of referring to any expensive, high- tech metal, especially titanium and magnesium. I don't know whether James Cameron thought he made it up, or if he heard a couple of bikers talking in a parking lot and absorbed it subliminally. Either way, it turned what was intended to be a significant scene into a big chuckle. <br/><br/>The only reason I gave this overlong cartoon more than 2 stars is the fact that I admire the effort of the actors, as well as the technical expertise of the CG people. The fact that this was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards tells me that either: (A) the choices that year were few; or (B) the members of the academy have lost all taste and perception. <br/><br/>As long as the viewer doesn't expect Avatar to be great cinematic literature. she or he can probably be entertained and not disappointed.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Hailed as a great technical achievement by introducing a new generation of stereoscopic cameras, Avatar changed the movie theater landscape. A couple of years later, it seems already somewhat dated in its use of 3D. Movies like Life of Pi have enhanced standards in 3D, offering a more total immersive experience than here, for example in reflection, depth and other visual effects.<br/><br/>The worlds defined are beautiful and interesting. The cinematography by Mauro Fiore was correctly rewarded with an Academy Award, as was the production design. Some ideas in the movie are also fascinating and modeled on biology: neurons, synapses, sources, ecological diversity and the interconnected networks between all things alive and dead. See how in the end nature cooperates and triumphs over the next quarterly statement.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the integration of several genres in one movie is an accomplishment in itself: war, adventure, science fiction and romance. Despite being a good overall idea, the further detailed script following is less intelligent and especially the lines itself are sometimes badly written, bordering even on the edge of being kitsch and laughable. The avatar idea is in itself great, but again needed more work in the script, just going in and out your avatar is too simple and the idea as a whole should have been further explored (introducing some welcome mythification in the story).<br/><br/>The message is anti-war and pro nature, but to make that statement it needs the war movie format to keep us entertained. It also references Aliens (even Ripley has a new role), and in form and style there is too much overlapping. I hope they fix these problems in Avatar 2.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">An amazing movie.Enriching and metaphorically relevant premise, beautifully displayed.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I think most SF fans will give this film a 10 out of 10. It is an amazing film...but in a way it is also a disappointing one. I say disappointing because the budget was huge and the amount of time spent on it was also huge...so with guidelines like that making a bomber would be probably impossible. I think it is also disappointing because it relies almost exclusively on special effects to make its story or plot function. I think special effects should be not the thing a movie revolves around, they should compliment the story-not be the story itself. The film leaves a powerful emotional charge in its wake which is an indication that the director was trying very hard to create something interesting-but as someone who is familiar with SF and artists in general, I can say that the filmmaker has borrowed heavily from the artwork of Yes album cover artist Roger Dean for inspiration in this films striking visuals, as well as the written works of Anne McCafferty, who wrote the Dragonsinger series of SF-Fantasy books. It is a great film, but how could it not be when a filmmaker can have such a huge budget-no time limit, and a world of amazing creative people to draw ideas from. The hard SF tech in this film looks like it fell out of both a Terminator film and an Alien sequel...go get 'em James Cameron.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I think I've grown to appreciate Avatar far more in hindsight than on initial release, now that we can (mostly) all come to the agreement that this isn't a Best Picture quality movie, let alone the greatest film ever made. However, just because Avatar doesn't quite live up to its hyperbolic initial reception does not make this a bad film in the slightest. Going back to it years later, there is still much to enjoy here from a worldbuilding, characterization and thematic perspective.<br/><br/>The best way to view Avatar is as James Cameron's Reverse Aliens. Aliens is very much a product of 80s politics; a world of \"kill-or-be-killed\" where the West represented the ultimate arbiter of moral and societal superiority, the non-Western world representative of something hostile and parasitic that threatened future generations. Avatar, on the other hand, represents a humanization of the non-Western world, a sincere attempt to understand and empathize with it and recognize its right at respect and existence. While this does unfortunately lend itself to the misguided, offensive \"noble savage\" characterization of the Na'vi at moments, this attempt by Cameron to embrace and empathize with what his films had previously shown aversion to is (For the most part) well handled and well intentioned. The film is distinctly \"pro-Veteran\" without being \"pro-War\", a far cry from the militaristic, America First, \"hoo-rah\" approach of Aliens and its many contemporaries. As much as people like to take shots at Cameron's Avatar as a vanity project, it shows a surprising amount of self awareness from Cameron to the problematic and outdated politics of his previous works.<br/><br/>Much has been made of Avatar's reliance on narrative cliches and formulaic plot elements. We've all heard the comparisons people have made to the likes of Ferngully, The Last Samurai, Dances With Wolves, e.t.c. However, I've long believed that following narrative cliches is forgiveable if you can add something fresh, new and deep to the material. While Avatar shares much in common with these films in terms of story, I would argue that it really does something special in its characters. Jake Scully's naive and childlike former army gruny makes for a rather sympathetic and likable lead, I appreciated how his character served the RDA out of a genuine ignorance for what they were fighting for and what they were planning rather than out of indifference or convenience; as far as he was concerned, the RDA were a well intentioned research organization, providing Jake the chance to walk again out of the goodness of their hearts. Mass scale atrocities are as much the result of ignorance as they are malevolence and Jake's arc from complicit instrument in the RDA's ruthless pillaging of Pandora to wise and self aware warrior ready to take control of his life is handled with genuine thoughtfulness. Despite the adulthood of its protagonist, Avatar almost feels like a \"coming of age\" story, with Jake growing into the man he was meant to be, only from a mental or emotional standpoint rather than a physical one.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington's performance as Jake is criminally underrated, he's an incredibly likable lead with some great comedic timing that I could easily see myself in as an audience member. His wide eyed awe of Pandora and its natural wonders and his hushed, humble voice wonderfully convey a character desperate to do the right thing, but with no idea how. It really is a shame to see Worthington slumming it in Direct-To-DvD work these days.<br/><br/>I never hear Wesley Studey get credit for his role in the film, which is a massive shame as he easily steals the show for me. Studi carries such a commanding, powerful presence and iconic vocal delivery as the clan leader Etyukan that it can even be felt through the somewhat aged motion capture. His performance is reminiscent of the very best turns from Frank Oz's Yoda; strong and wise beyond measure, strict in nature, but with a deep level of empathy and compassion for those under his tutelage.<br/><br/>The worldbuilding in Avatar is absolutely phenomenal, I don't believe it would be a stretch to call it Star Wars-like in its detail, size and scope. Pandora's symbiotic ecosystem makes for a beautiful and touching allegory for not just our own natural environment on Earth, but for the human race as a whole. With even the seemingly small death of a single tree, the potential ripple effects for a natural or social habitat can be catastrophic. I also found myself deeply appreciative of Cameron's display of the patient, progressive behavior of the natural world. Every meaningful relationship in Avatar puts an emphasis on methodical growth, understanding and patience; this is felt in the film's romance, in the relations between the humans and the Na'vi, in the relations between the Na'vi and their banshees. Nature, and emotion by association, cannot be moved by mere force of will alone. Whatever critics may say, the pro-environmentalism aspects of Avatar possess far more imagination and inventiveness than what meets the eye.<br/><br/>Avatar is not a \"perfect\" film or a masterpiece, persay. However, it certainly comes very, very close to being great. The film has far deeper themes than its given credit for that are explored in more interesting ways than the surface readings that many audiences have interpreted. Much like Jake's understanding of Pandora, its people and its wildlife, perhaps we would benefit from looking past that surface in analyzing what this interesting film has to offer. Bring on the trilogy, Cameron!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The last time we had a film that broke through moviegoers in terms of what was visual and what effected us was \"Star Wars\" back in 1977. Now,many years later, James Cameron has brought a film to the screen that serves its' purpose to moviegoers in such a way, I should say the art of film has started all over again.Technology isn't the only reason why \"Avatar\" will stand out as a classic. You may disagree with me if you want. Thats alright with me. All I am saying is that \"Avatar\" delivers what I think is new in the process in the art of filmmaking. It's going to happen. Every several years, there is bound to be a film that teaches us how we should feel about how film should work. \"Avatar\", technically and emotionally, is one of those films that accomplishes that in every way that I have seen. As I was watching \"Avatar\", my thoughts and focus weren't just on the visual effects although the visual effects were tremendously spectacular in every way. It received a well deserved Academy Award for it's effects and none of these effects could not be done several years ago.Now, with the proper technology, It seems that the art of filmmaking has evolved. \"Avatar\" is one of those films that belongs in the evolutionary process. I am going to be truthful here. The one film that will knock \"Avatar\" off the map is \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" which came out in 1968. Just because \"Avatar\" is not really on top, it doesn't mean that it does not deserves the recognition that it has been getting the past year. It goes right up there with films like \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and Star Wars\". \"Avatar\" widens your eyes. It's an unexpected look into a beautiful world of filmmaking. Several years from now, some director will make a film that will breakthrough moviegoers expectancies of whatever film they watch. \"Avatar\" did that. How many times have you seen a film like that? \"Avatar\" is not just a film. It's an experience that will be remembered by moviegoers for years to come.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The film shows a near-perfect planet in the beauty of Pandora. The colorful plants are vivid and the huge waterfalls flow down. It is a very famous visual feast. The applause after watching the film is really a bit touched. It belongs to the most classic in the movie. I hope that the second part will be broken soon.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Of course, it's a feast for eyes. The technical peak position of Avatar is unquestionable. But the film itself is lackluster, or rather lacking originality. Besides, it is an apology that is 500 years late, for Indians and for history.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie can be reviewed in 2 parts.<br/><br/>Visually this is a stunning movie. Even if it wasn't 3D the backdrops, the scenery, the visual effects on the Navi are breathtaking. WETA has upped it a notch. Amazing how far they've come in such a short time. The 3D effect took me some time to get used to but once I was adjusted, WOW. Mind blowing. The motion was so smooth too, even on the effects shots. Just for the spectacle itself I had to give it a 7/10. Someone said this is a milestone movie, one in which people will be comparing the technical achievements of all future movies. I wholeheartedly agree.<br/><br/>The storyline and character development however were sadly lacking. The story is simple, and that I could forgive. However, its parallels with \"Dances With Wolves\" were too close and too obvious to miss. It's bad when you're sitting in a movie and are constantly reminded every 5 minutes that James Cameron photocopied the script to Dances with Wolves and stuck in Navi instead of Navajo. For that I gave him 1 point.<br/><br/>So total is 8/10.<br/><br/>Be sure to see this on a big screen in 3D, iMax if you have it...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">One hallmark of a poor movie is that the experience significantly degrades upon repeated viewings. For all the spectacular CGI, incredible scenery, and highly imaginative landscaping, the movie bores repeatedly with one movie cliché after another. Do I need to count what was stolen from The Matrix, Alien/Aliens, Dances with Wolves? Why rely on what has become known plot twists and conventions? How could Cameron recycle so many overused ideas in one movie? Sure the concept had much potential -- but with the focus on the FX, the more subtle plot details get washed out in predictability. Of course, the movie looks spectacular, especially in 3D on IMAX. The movie could have been so much more...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron is a force of nature. His movies have an all-encompassing, ambient power of their own. The kind of power that makes a James Cameron movie a bigger deal than everything else. Avatar is his biggest yet. Every Cameron trope is out in full force: Bad-ass chicks, space marines, over-the-top action, and a sweeping love story. Avatar is in many ways an amalgamation of everything that makes James Cameron a unique voice in Hollywood. Elements of Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, True Lies, and Titanic are distilled here into a visionary masterwork of classic epic filmmaking and cutting-edge technology.<br/><br/>Avatar's ambitious story follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) as he travels to the rainforest planet of Pandora to replace his late brother in the Avatar program, which allows certain humans to inhabit a body that resembles that of Pandora's native humanoids, the Na'vi. The leader of the program, Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), hopes to use avatars to peacefully interact with the natives. Meanwhile, others, including the greedy CEO, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) and the military leader, Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) look to exploit the Na'vi for a precious resource called unobtanium. Jake Sully is caught between these two worlds when he meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a blue-skinned Pocahontas who introduces him to her culture.<br/><br/>Jake's inner conflict drives Avatar's story, and structurally, it works. Yes, it borrows a lot from Dances with Wolves. Learning from and becoming part of another culture is nothing new, but Avatar presents this classic tale in a fresh way. As a paraplegic, Sully's avatar allows him freedom. It gives him a genuine reason to view Na'vi life as an opportunity to start anew. I can buy it. And once the two sides of him finally clash, the power of that conflict really hits. It's a tangibly large story. Epic and engrossing. The effectiveness of that simple story, well told, of connecting with your supposed enemies is why I resent the disingenuous love story Cameron decided to put front and center.<br/><br/>Before I get to the lavish praise of Avatar, which I consider one of the most special movie experiences of the century, I must address my one nagging grievance. The love story, the Neytiri character, and all the preachy \"bio-spiritual\" fluff that comes with her, irked me. James Cameron has never been known for subtle characters, and Avatar doesn't change that. Dr. Augustine is a tough-talking scientist with a penchant for cigarettes, Colonel Quaritch is a hard-as-steel military grunt with a giant scar across his face, and the CEO practices golf in his office. The point is, these are bold-faced archetypes. Neytiri is no different. She's a tree-hugging, flower-power philosopher. That's fine, but Zoe Saldana's performance has none of Stephen Lang's towering vitality or Weaver's cool confidence. It's all screeching and posturing. She's shrill and angry, and her spirituality quickly devolves into a full-on castigation of the evils of military conquest and deforestation. Shouldn't this spiritual guide be a little more even-keeled? I never believed that Jake would fall for her. Compared to Cameron's other movie romance, Titanic, Avatar seems manufactured. Neytiri is less a character than she is a face on which to pin the movie's heavy-handed message.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, let's get to what makes Avatar the single most monumental cinematic achievement of this generation. James Cameron creates, in Pandora, the most rich, realistic, and fully realized fictional world in the history of cinema. From a design standpoint alone, the imagination ingrained in the animals, plants, and vehicles is absolutely staggering. Pandora is miles ahead of everything else in terms of diversity of life, and what's really astounding is that with all these varied alien elements, Cameron somehow makes this place real. From the high-tech, lived-in military bases to the elaborate Na'vi culture, with its palpable sense of history, Cameron's attention to detail in Avatar is revolutionary.<br/><br/>So too are his technical innovations. The movie is remembered most for it's pioneering use of 3D, and rightfully so. Implemented alongside the uncanny photo-realism of the Na'vi's, the creatures, the mountain-sized trees, and the bio-luminous plants, the 3D is more transporting than anything I have ever seen. All the superlatives in the world can't completely do justice to the Weta team that brought Cameron's gargantuan vision to reality, so I won't bother. The truly commendable aspect of Avatar is not that the special effects are so sophisticated, but that you forget that what you are watching are indeed special effects. Avatar uses 3D to immerse rather than amuse. You are absorbed in the world of Pandora so completely, that it cuts across the divide we have with most films. You don't watch Avatar, you live it, feel it, experience it.<br/><br/>That feeling of absolute immersion is what defines Avatar. It's a movie, with plot, characters, and a story, but that stuff doesn't matter as much as the physical sensation it creates of actually being in a brand-new world. It's true, Jake Sully is less important than Pandora. But those who dismiss Avatar as simply \"pretty pictures\" are undervaluing the impact of James Cameron's image-making. Avatar creates visuals and utilizes technology so well, it makes the audience feel like part of the film. Some people take for granted just how significant that is. Others take for granted James Cameron's direction. Here is the single most ambitious movie ever conceived, and Cameron handles it all with the confidence of a world-class chef. This guy is not intimidated by anything. He is an elite director; the world's leader in action and world-building, and miraculously, he keeps getting better! Avatar is his most accomplished film.<br/><br/>Avatar's success lies in its ability to engross every kind of moviegoer. Science fiction geeks and action aficionados can revel in some of the most thrilling action scenes ever put to film (The final battle alone is more exciting than 99% of blockbusters before or since), sentimental romantics can connect to the classic story, and even those who don't connect to either can experience the once-in-a-lifetime thrill of visiting Pandora. James Cameron has made a picture that defies comparison. There is not another movie that reverberates with the ethereal power of Avatar. Because Avatar is beyond movies. The film is overwhelming; An event imagined and shot on a scale bigger and bolder than anything I've seen. Assisted by James Horner's majestic score and Mauro Fiore's epic cinematography, Avatar totally envelopes us in an exotic world. An original masterwork of popular entertainment, Avatar deserves its spot as the biggest hit in movie history. This is truly Cameron's magnum opus, a movie that burns with boundless passion. A classic that thrills as it inspires awe.<br/><br/>93/100</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron has always been a visionary director, since he burst onto an unsuspecting world with The Terminator in 1984. At $6million, that movie was anticipated by almost nobody; the big film of that Orwellian year was Dune - at $40million, the most expensive film ever made. Fast forward to 2009, a Cameron returns from more than a decade in the film-making wilderness to deliver his most expensive, ambitious film yet. It's rare for any movie to live up to they hype these days, and at a cost of $300million, the critics were sharpening their quills to stab at the self proclaimed king of the world. Comparisons to Ferngully and Halo were rife, but Avatar quickly buries those small minded, trite jibes; this is the real deal, and every penny of its price tag is up there on the big screen. The 3d is as immersive as you'd hope from any big screen blockbuster which requests grown men and women sit in chilly cinemas looking like refugees from the golden era of the 1950s - aka rather ridiculous. James Cameron's script might not be the most polished in the world, but on a comic book, teenage level it works wonders, and it's hard not to be gripped by some of the best action scenes committed to celluloid. Will it make it's money back? Only time will tell. However, for one 41-year-old who has grown up loving most of Cameron's work, the fact i could quite happily sit through the movie again a couple of hours after watching it suggests it will make a pile of cash from repeat business. Do yourself a favour, get to the biggest cinema screening it with a pair of 3d glasses, sit back and enjoy the ride. For once you can believe the hype.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's 'Avatar' has beaten his earlier 'Titanic' to be crowned the most expensive and highest-grossing film ever made. But was this merely an exercise in gross profligacy (between $237m and $500m, depending on whose gossip you prefer)? And is this re-release, featuring an additional (unidentifiable) eight minutes of footage, anything but a cynical scheme to add to the already ludicrous box-office takings (over $2.5bn and counting)?<br/><br/>Americans go to Pandora, a moon of an unmentioned planet, to mine for an element unobtainable on Earth called – wait for it – Unobtainium. The only problem is that the indigenous Na'vi – these sylph-like, 12-feet-tall giants – have a penchant for shooting deadly arrows at intruders, and just happen to be housed above the densest source of the precious element. Diplomacy with the locals is exhausted far too prematurely and all-out war is declared. <br/><br/>The plagiarism is too manifold to mention. But did Cameron think that by colouring characters blue he would hide the fact that the central plot – an interracial love story – is a facsimile of the ones seen in such films as 'Dances With Wolves' and 'The Last Samurai'? A thought occurred to me: Why are Americans, who invest millions to get a thing like 'Avatar' onto the screen, so keen to reinforce their own stereotype as part of the story? <br/><br/>We were promised so much: That we wouldn't notice what was computer-generated and what wasn't, that we would empathise with the cartoon creations as we would do with humans, that we would feel as if we were actually on Pandora. None of these things are true. Such hyperbole is insulting to films more deserving of these effects, films much older than 'Avatar' and therefore more technically restricted, such as 'Jurassic Park' and the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. <br/><br/>Industry experts are telling us that film in three dimensions is the way forward. What they cunningly omit to say is that 3-D visuals are bad for your eyes, and result in everything else being two-dimensional! Cameron predicts that, in a decade or so, all films, irrespective of their genre, will be in 3-D. For the sake of all those who care about cinema, I hope he is wrong. <br/><br/>www.scottishreview.net</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The story of avatar is actually a copy of last samurai, but last samurai was a lot better in terms of character development and story. While avatar is highly overrated by critics and fanboys by its seems to be stunning cgi and story, actually it's quite unconvincing in most aspects. While the CG backgrounds and actions was great at the time, the aliens are too unrealistic and rubber plastic. The character's decisions are as well quite unconvincing and lack of emotion due to immature facial expressions, with mind blending pseudo science crap that couldn't even convince a student. Also waging war against an alien settlement and to exterminate them for some silly resource is just flimsy, since the cost would be much even higher, which also brings much moral issues that is unreasonable to execute in today's standard. Avatar is another highly overrated movie by james cameron besides titanic, and the movie's has an extremely predictable ending.</div>,\n",

The imagination used in the visual effects is incredible. James Cameron has crafted such an impressive film to look at, so why could he not have used this gift to create a screenplay that was more original, that had more depth and that wasn't so predictable? It's still a good story and the film is enormously entertaining, but the script prevents it from achieving that level of greatness that would distinguish it as a truly landmark film. Great score, the art direction and cinematography are superb. It's certainly memorable and good performances from everyone.</div>,\n",

Avatar is visually arresting, well-paced science fiction adventure that offers a view of an alien world that's more detailed than we've ever had the chance to see. The special effects, which are almost entirely computer generated, are a real spectacle - a virtue that's magnified when viewed in 3D. The progressive attitude toward the preservation of wildlife and culture has special currency in Avatar.<br/><br/>The not-so-good news? While quite enjoyable, the cgi effects too often seemed artificial in specific scenes. The aliens seem more human/aboriginal in personality than truly otherworldly, and the villains are evil without much in the way of nuance. <br/><br/>The verdict? Avatar is an exotic, well-imagined adventure that would have been even better if the filmmakers had avoided certain clichés.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is not the best movie of all time. Let's get that out of the way right now. It might be one of the biggest, just like director James Cameron's last film, Titanic, was. And since comparisons to that other Cameron classic is inevitable, let's talk about it right now: Avatar is not as good. Titanic was a huge epic event movie and yet managed to deliver a story that was undeniably personal and human; Avatar doesn't quite do that, and therein lies its greatest weakness.<br/><br/>But let me back up a few steps: Avatar is a very entertaining and thrilling ride, and most definitely worth seeing on the big screen. Filled with breathtaking imagery, dazzling effects, and grand storytelling with big emotions, it's exactly what a crowd-pleaser is made of. Unfortunately, grand storytelling has a way of becoming lost within itself. Cameron's script is strongly lacking in the dialogue department. The words coming out of the character's mouths often feel dry and fake, though the cast does its best with the material. Of particular note is the wonderful Zoe Saldana, taking the difficult role of the Na'vi princess and filling it with genuine humanity and emotion. Yet perhaps her very personal performance stands out like it does because the rest of the movie is so broad. This is evidenced even by the running time, a whopping 2 hours and 45 minutes, a length that is felt on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>Still, Avatar shouldn't be dismissed, and it won't be. As ticket sales already show, this movie is going to be around for a long time, and love for it will flow profusely. Yet there's also something more to Avatar; it is an inherently political movie. The story of the indigenous people being pushed out of their home and impressed upon by the invading humans does not allow for a non-political movie. What's amazing about Avatar is the innocent way in which it brings about its message and the subtlety with which it convinces you of its truth. Cameron uses his tale and its great big emotions to present us with stark images of military extremity and (let's face it) American consumer selfishness. It's quite notable that a movie can get us to root against the evil humans and have the main character refer to them as the 'aliens' by the end. Even the most lightweight film viewer will find it almost impossible not to notice the strong messages, and one must give Cameron props for the way he makes a movie set on an alien planet hit America right at home. The way the themes are naturally embedded in the story allows for easy relatability, and makes it easier for us to consider that some of our methods need to be reexamined.<br/><br/>Avatar is a two-sided film. On a purely entertainment-focused level, it is nothing more than a thoroughly enjoyable, great big action extravaganza, but it has major flaws. However, you have to admire a mainstream film that can examine such relevant issues in thoughtful, honest ways, and promote the most simple message of all: Peace. <br/><br/>Jay Addison</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Ten years after \"Titanic\", People have been waiting for James Cameron's next project. \"Avatar\" is Cameron's ambitious project to explore the Special Effects better than ever. From his filmography such as \"Aliens\" (1986), \"Terminator\" (1984), \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\" (1991), \"True Lies\" (1994) and \"Titanic\", we should never doubt Cameron's resume. In 1997, \"Titanic\" won 11 Oscars, to be equal with \"Ben-Hur\" (1959) as all-time best achievement in Academy Awards. Cast members of \"Avatar\" are Sam Worthington, Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi, and Sigourney Weaver (who has already become iconic tough woman character in Cameron's \"Aliens\"). Thiz movie has a unique story that reflects the originality of the script. While we are watching \"Avatar\", we will not realize that 90% of the movie is actually animation. The technology itself has reached the new level of movie-making. They have already set up the bar so high to challenge in the coming years. The stunning moment that I like to watch over and over again is the night scene of forest landmark. The forest description is filled with the glowing unique plants. There's something exotic and beautiful about that scene. The best thing I love about \"Avatar\", it contains strong environmental issue. In my opinion, Thiz movie also has tremendous hidden philosophies inside. It's all about human need, environmental effect and human heart. Like I have said before, \"Open your eyes, the dream is over. Close your eyes, it's still a dream\".

The story is an utterly trite regurgitation of Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves: See James Cameron saying European/white civilization is bad. See James Cameron saying technology is bad. See James Cameron saying capitalism is bad. See James Cameron saying primitives are naturally wiser, kinder, more ethical, more moral, more \"in touch with nature\", etc. etc. ad nauseum. Of course, Cameron himself made a gazillion bucks with a capitalist enterprise, and has more vehicles and more technology created by the civilization he rakes over the coals than 99 percent of the population, and isn't interested in giving it all up while preaching that the rest of us have to make do with less, but people are obviously untroubled by that.<br/><br/>And, of course, none of the people oohing and ahhing over the primitive culture depicted here have any interest in chucking it all going off to live in the rain forest while wearing a loin cloth, including Cameron, but that's also to be overlooked.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Finally, after a year of hype and endless speculation about what effect it would have on the motion picture industry, James Cameron's Avatar has arrived. Having finished watching it not more than an hour ago, I'm here to spell it out for you: go see this movie immediately. It's a breathtaking spectacle, and one that's almost impossible to process in one viewing. Avatar is nothing short of revolutionary, serving as a visual opus for the ages and a guiding light for the future of filmmaking. So, now that I'm done heaping unconditional praise on Cameron's grand return to the multiplex, let's break this thing down.<br/><br/>Exhibit A: the story. If you've read any of the early reviews of the film, you're aware of the fact that many critics have declared Avatar a success solely on the technical front. This was something that worried me as I excitedly donned the yellow 3D glasses issued me by my local Regal Cinema, but not even 15 minutes into the film all of those fears had dissolved. The story is solid all around, and it features a number of standout performances. I have to tip my hat to Zoe Saldana first and foremost. Saldana plays Neytiri, a member of the Na'vi species that inhabits the planet Pandora. Working just beneath the photo-realistic surface of a CGI\n",

       " she manages to elicit the strongest emotional response from viewers by really making us care about the welfare of her people.<br/><br/>I have to be honest: going into this, the premise seemed a little too Dances With Wolves (and thus in grave danger of succumbing to cliché and, of course, the resultant eye-rolling). Thankfully, though, the story is presented with enough originality to stand on its own. Cameron nicely balances what can only be described as National Geographic-esque documentary footage with the story of a budding romance between Jake Sully (Worthington)—a marine with a chip on his shoulder—and Neytiri. There's also the presence of a greedy corporate executive and a hardened military Colonel, both of whom execute their respective roles admirably. The narrative is completely absorbing, and only on very brief occasions does it falter and break the trance it has on the audience. These moments come in the form of treatises on global warming and the many ways \"terrorism\" can be defined, and they are indeed noticeable when they arrive (mainly because they're in such sharp contrast to the otherwise engrossing story line). Cameron, it seems, works best when he's dealing with broader philosophical concepts (see Terminator 2: Judgment Day). There are also a handful of other \"Oh, that's convenient\" moments, but these are also few and far between. Really, the tale Cameron spins for us is very well constructed. It's all logical, and despite how fantastic some of the things you see on screen may seem, you still believe in their existence.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the effects. In a word, they're phenomenal. I'm always hesitant to use the word \"ever\" when writing a review—I think long and hard before actually including it in anything I write—but Avatar is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. Even though the Na'vi are entirely fictional, they look real. I mean, really real. This is also the case with every other organism inhabiting Pandora. The success of what you see on screen is due mainly to the fluidity of movement (especially in the case of the Na'vi); the sense that it's all \"organic\" pervades every frame, and the attention paid to detail is mind-boggling. It's clear that Cameron is really enjoying mulling over the intricacies of a piece of Pandoran fruit, for example (especially when Jake's avatar takes a big bite out of it), and we can't help but be swept up in the grandiose nature of it all. In one particular scene, where Jake and Neytiri are running across a phosphorescent/bioluminescent mold of some sort, things verge on sensory overload (and I mean that in a very, very good way).<br/><br/>The use of 3D is, of course, integral to the convincing nature of what you're seeing, and there are no gimmicks here. Unlike past movies where objects stick out and threaten to poke you in the face, the third dimension is subtlety (yet effectively) utilized in Avatar. As a matter of fact, it won't be long before you forget that you're wearing dopey yellow sunglasses. When people call this film a viewing experience, that's exactly what it is: an experience. I can talk about it 'til I'm blue in the face, but you won't really understand until you strap yourself into the center of the theater and dive headlong into the entirely believable world that Cameron and company have created.<br/><br/>And, as with any good James Cameron movie, there are plenty of \"awweeesoommmeee!\" action moments. Again, I think it's futile for me to try and describe them, but they rival anything from his earlier entries (yes—that includes Aliens and T2). Especially great is the epic final battle, as is a heart-stopping chase scene that occurs early on between Jake and an indigenous beast.<br/><br/>If ever there were a movie that you absolutely must see on the big screen, this is it. And, if it's at all possible, see it in IMAX. You can thank me later.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's interesting and it's exotic, and so imaginatively rendered! Indeed, a cinematic thrill-ride! The film's CGI effects deliver a natural and unspoiled world to compare with a world of machines, and its digital characters are gorgeously stunning to behold! And the film does seem like one amazing futuristic action-battle razzmatazz, directed with the most uncanny computer-generated 3-D technological feat, James Cameron's epic film is, in fact, an eco-minded epic, gastulated with the most humanly issues, universally familiar ever since the colonial times. Indeed, the film's rich themes are immensely dark! Indeed, its story injects themes of colonization, imperialism, militarism, cultural differences and cross-cultural communication, and genetic engineering...all of which any misstep taken could be disastrous to peace, nature and humanity. <br/><br/>Needless to say, this film does again echo Cameron's trademark film themes of corporate greed and the love-hate relationships with technology. Indeed, like the love between Jack and Rose in Titanic,' this love between the movie's Jake and Nevtiri, is solid that could only wither when 'death doth them part.' And in war, there will always be those who'd be willing to fight as long as it's a just war, as exemplified by Michelle Rodriquez' Trudy. <br/><br/>James Cameron's film captures two worlds... Earth that is highly and technologically advanced and which we are familiar, and the other, a seemingly 'primitive' and physically-fit civilization of the Pandora planet, in which terrain and life remains little altered since God's generous Creation! The year is 2154, the year when modern and advanced technology has given way to the moist exclusive and unique weaponry and robotic achievements for war and science does allow avatars to be created for one human race to look like another. <br/><br/>Wouldn't anyone be as flattered as Sam Worthington's Jake Sully to be selected to be as part of the exploration team of the exotic Na'vi world, especially when it's headed by the brilliant botanist, Sigourney Weaver' Grace. After all, their mission is for the good of human curiosity, scientific research, and knowledge! After all, Jake does understand that his twin brother had died while on the same mission, and that, he has the same genetic match of his brother to easily replace him without posing any unsuspecting lab complication. As we follow the wheel-chair bound Marine veteran in his avatar status into the Pandora planet, what is captured is so amazingly dreamlike. It's a world filled with mysticism, and in which nature thrives in absolute pure beauty and in abundance, with blue-skinned, golden-eyed, and very tall and slender beings functioning with and around nature, and complying with nature's forces... sans technology; sans machines. Indeed, an absolute contrast to Jake's own harsh world of man-created machines and scientific labs! Though the presence of Grace serves to remind Jake of his mission, it is in Pandora that Jake finds his rebirth of life.... his ability to walk and fly without constraints, a refreshingly new way to live, and he is also falling in love. And Jake does enter a world in which unimaginable creatures, like viperwolves, thanators, and banshees,roam! <br/><br/>Oh, I do love the scenes in which Zoe Saldana's Neytiri, under the order of her mother, the Na'vi shaman Moat, teaches Jake the survival tactics of the Omaticaya people. My favorite moments are when Jake tries to control and bond with a banshee, and later, with the Direhorse! But when Jake discovers the real reasons for the interests of Center's Administrator (Giovanni Ribisi's Parker Selfridge) and Stephen Lang's Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) in the Pandora planet, will he continue his mission? The Pandora planet has a rich natural resource, a rare and valuable mineral called unobtanium, deposited beneath a Hometree. Will Jake continue his scouting for Colonel Quaritch's soldiers and lead them to the mineral deposits? And will Grace and all her team members, including Jake, support the exploitations of Pandora's inhabitants? Will Jake betray his Earth people and can he be able to win Neytiri and the Na'vi people's trust? What if he goes against Selfridge and Colonel Quaritch? After all, these evil and greedy two have access to the lab that controls his avatar! <br/><br/>What follows is our observance of the character dealing with their conscience, as Pandora continues to face attacks and destruction, both from ground and from air, as nature and people are blown to bits! The amazing CGI effects make the battle - between Earth's military-industrial forces and the oppressed, arrow-bearing inhabitants of the Pandora planet - very engaging. And Director Cameron does take his story to its climax, ultimately reminding us that nature is not a force to be reckoned. And ultimately, this film is about 'good' winning over 'evil.' Every character, human or digital, is interesting to follow, providing his or her conscience to his/her role in delivering the film's themes, And overall, the film is spectacularly mesmerizing and very enjoyable!</div>,\n",

Sure the film is a near apology of the militaristic and weaponry worship James Cameron peppered his other films with. But at the end of the day, it's still just Pocahontas.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. There are one or two wow scenes, and they are not dependent on 3D. But it really feels like Cameron wrote the final battle, then worked backward to make sure all his pay-offs fit just right. Kinda thin folks. And though it does keep you going to the credits, I won't be paying to see it again and this is in no way a \"game changer.\"<br/><br/>As for the benefits of 3D? By this point I've seen half a dozen movies in 3D theatrically in the last couple years and Avatar has not changed what I felt about the experience. With some exception, after about 15 minutes, the sensation of 3D wears off. Your eyes adjust and you are still left with a somewhat lumbering two and a half hour movie. Also, in 3D, the imagery is soft and in 90% of the movie, it contributes nothing. But hey, its worth it just so you can say you saw it in 3D right?<br/><br/>Not bad, not great.

I don't think any movie can ever beat Avatar's special effects for a long long time. It's pretty early sure but I think Avatar will be judged as one of the greatest movies of all time. It has a classic storyline of good and evil, right and wrong, but it is only with blue aliens instead. Cameron has created his own brilliant world and populated it with aliens with a unique mythology. We want to know how to be like them but only action hero Sam Worthington can discover the secrets. The idea of the Avatar is one of the most original sci-fi creations. It takes a certain inspired brilliance to have Jake Sully a wheel chaired guy to become a creature of the forest through virtual reality. The 3-D in Avatar is by far the best I've ever seen. If you want great 3-D than Avatar is the way to go. James Cameron is the King of the World and if I were him I'd simply retire because he has made a great movie, too great really. All other Sci-Fi epics pale in comparison to Avatar. Stephen Lang's character is a better villain than Darth Vader...</div>,\n",

It also seems to enjoy monkeying about with huge issues, concepts and themes, such as genocide and religion, though there is nothing depicted here that we haven't seen done before, and done better.<br/><br/>Even its visuals – which are supposed to be the film's crowning glory – are immensely overrated, and however splendid they may be, they have been outdone time and again by the greats (Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Robert Zemeckis, Baz Lhurmann, Steven Spielberg, Jim Henson...). After all, when has CGI ever stood a chance against puppetry and stop-motion animation? A dimension is added by the stunning 3D, but a dimension is taken away by the paper-thin, unsustainable plot.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it still manages to be entertaining and frequently rather affecting, but it's excruciatingly slow-moving for an action film and surprisingly ordinary for the highest-grossing film in cinema history.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang try their hardest not be outdone by colourful trees, unintentionally hilarious digital monsters and blue-skinned, elf-like Aborigines.</div>,\n",

The damaged hero who can do what nobody else could do, not even the natives, the stupid military man, the commercial leader of the outpost, the reasonable scientist who knows better but is not believed, the \"good\" natives with their holy secrets. Come on people, we are in the 21th century, movie making is over 100 year's old and we can not come up with anything better than that for a great movie? OK I admit the graphics blew me away, they are beautiful. For that reason alone this movie earns some points. But a movie is not just about nice pictures. It is also about story. Without a decend story a movie becomes nothing, a facade. It is a such a waste of the beautiful effects. <br/><br/>And so the time watching this is also wasted</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">With all the hype, \"Avatar\" had a lot to live up to. I thought it was a really great film, but it did not live up to all the hype for me. It would be one thing if it was the first 3D movie experience, but I saw \"A Christmas Carol\" just two months earlier and knew what to expect on that front. <br/><br/>The look of \"Avatar\" is very cool. The landscapes are all wonderful to look at and with the all the glow-in-the-dark surroundings paired with the 3D environment it really made me feel as though I was in an attraction at Disney World rather than in a movie theater.<br/><br/>The concept was pretty cool as well. I liked the fact that Jake lived these dual lives. It seems like careful planning would have to be taken when that sort of thing is to be achieved and it was done quite seamlessly here. <br/><br/>As for the story goes, I thought it was okay. It reminded me a lot of \"The Last Samurai\", only not done as well. The way that the enemy of the natives is taken in and then grows to love and belong to the civilization that he was once out to destroy. \"The Last Samurai\" ends much better than this though. Here it is very predictable that the good guys will win, Jake gets to become one of them and gets the girl, and the humans are shipped home while nature prevails. <br/><br/>A small nitpick that I have with this film is the year that it takes place in. 2154? So 144 years in the future the human race will develop all this new technology, discover an new planet in a new solar system, travel to it, and begin living and colonizing there? James Cameron really has a lot of faith in science and technology flourishing quickly.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Looking into Hindu mythology, when Gods descend to Earth they acquire avatars to make themselves known by human beings. Of the recent years' TV animation series let's look over \"Ōban Star-Racers\" from Jetix and \"The Last Airbender\" from Nickelodeon for avatar concept. In Ōban Star-Racers, the Earth had been threatening by antagonist galactic races and human beings were expecting a savior from space who is called the Avatar. On the other hand in the Last Airbender, avatar concept was completely confused with Prophecy. Aang the Avatar was born in the form of human being, which is wrong; because Avatar is a form of a God which has no destiny, no life, no death. <br/><br/>Herein James Cameron's Avatar, the concept is truly appropriate to the origins of Hindu mythology: When humankind explores the planet Pandora, they aimed to search for underground resources; so they send an ex-serviceman to the natives in a DNA mapped hybrid body(which seems like one of them) to capture their secrets. Becoming the Avatar of natives by time, the ex-serviceman saves the planet from humankind, turning against his origin. <br/><br/>Exploring a new planet, descending on the ground, trying to capture it by blending within natives, but failing to do so... This actually is the same storyline with a Sci-Fi legend: Franklin Schaffner's \"Planet of The Apes(1968)\". Still keeping its sense with having the most terrifying ending of all science fiction works ever created, Planet of The Apes has so many things in common with Avatar. The Apes and the Na'vis both seemed atrocious and uncivilized at first. Then we realized that they're in fact very cuddly creatures. Both Charlton Heston and Sam Worthington became beloved with a female native, and we're introduced to their untouched and God's gift virgin nature. Then as in Star Wars and Abyss, humankind declares war against the natives to capture their lands and resources. <br/><br/>Another unique similarity between Planet of the Apes is that humankind is the evil-side again. So the same message we get with a deeper self-criticism is that humankind is the one who destroys the nature and is responsible of all wars. Wasn't this the Terminator's message as well, spoken out by Sarah Connor? \"It's in our nature to destroy ourselves\". All to the good, we didn't lose our World to apes or cyborgs this time.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie has one major flaw in my opinion - no back story - it assumes that the audience is already familiar with the history of the plot - it just starts off with humans on the planet pandora (obviously weve been there for years) according to the very brief narration and that weve been trying to work things out with the creatures known as the N'avi. Now ,i know nothing about anything going into this movie . so i have no idea who anyone is ,who the navi are or why we are on pandora - its like jumping into the middle of a book that you have never read. I for one don't like movies that have no backstory and just make things up along the way. We find out that avatars are some type of hybrid alien/human bodies that humans can transfer their consciousness into and inhabit, OK now im really lost ? there is never any story behind it all. such as what happened to earth , when did we discover pandora and why are we there to begin with , its all just assumed that we the audience are ignorant. eventually we find out that the greedy humans along with a military wack job want to plunder pandora for a material that is worth millions. so we have the hero become an avatar and ends up falling in love with a native catlike girl alien and then it becomes a clichéd battle with unbelievable bad dialog and too much visual effects that are designed to make you forget that the movie is another 2 hours long..<br/><br/>Like I said in the title of my review. Nice visual effects but otherwise -a confusing disjointed borefest. 3/10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">A HUGE disappointment! I don't like going to the cinemas and wasting fifteen dollars on one movie but Avatar seemed to me like a movie the would blow me away completely and probably earn a straight ten from me. So, how can this \"masterpiece\" be a complete failure, in my professional opinion, and better yet why is it in the top 250? It has got so much attention for like two months and it is getting even more famous over the last couple days but it does not mean this is the best movie in the world. Who cares if it has gotten 8.8 on IMDb or if it has broken the all time box office record but in the end you have to ask yourself: \"Was it really worth it?\". And for me, sadly, it was not what I expected, I was petrified that it descended down my ladder more quickly than Epic Movie, and the first-half seemed to me like the movie was wasted. The 3-D was not cool and the glasses hurt my nose, it hurt so much that I had to take them of repeatedly just to massage my nose and was I thankful for that. Sure, Avatar looks visually great, it may have the best graphics in a film ever, and it really makes the movie worthwhile but you have to give all the credit to the money. Without it Avatar could suck my brass balls! Please disregard that last comment! Thank you. James Cameron has directed my favorite action film of all time, Terminator 2, and for that I am eternally grateful but Avatar hypnotizes people into thinking that it has the best story ever when it doesn't. The graphics and the world of Pandora just cover up how sh*t the story really is. Just to put it straight, James Cameron has disappointed me......a lot! A respected and a well known director making a film about blue people is hilarious especially if they are called the Na'Avi. The film starts out slow and boring, no action, no laughs, just plain slowness and it surprisingly remains like that for an hour and a half but paces up in the rest of the remaining time. I really expected more from this film! Sigourney Weaver gave the performance of a hard-a$$ scientist who, obviously, starts to develop emotions in the end but it was so sad to see that it didn't leave a good impression on Avatar. Sam Worthington did really good in playing the wheelchair bound Jake Sully who takes up the role of being a Na'Avi and it is when he is a Na'Avi, he gives a good and strong performance. Stephen Lang who plays the f...ed up Marine was a walking cliché because in every eye candy the mean guy has to be strong and fearless and Stephen delivered that right on the mark. Zoe Saldana did pretty good in playing a Na'Avi but her accent immediately gives her away. Giovanni Ribisi was my favorite actor in the film for many simple reasons, he was funny, cool sort of guy, and he offered the kind of personality which made him unique from the rest of the bums.<br/><br/>(May Contain Some Spoilers!!!) In the year 2154, Jake Sully, a wheelchair bound guy, arrives on the planet Pandora and he immediately realizes that he is not in Kansas anymore. First of all a war is raging on between the humans and the Na'Avi over a precious material which is buried in the blue peoples sacred ground. Second of all, he realizes that technology has somewhat evolved and transformer-type war machines along with a few more weapons have given the humans advantage to unleash hell on Pandora. He signs up for the Avatar program and expects the unexpected. He can suddenly walk again and with his new advantage he does a bit of \"searching around\". He meets a girl (Zoe Saldana)and after getting used to the blue parasites lifestyle, he starts developing feelings for them.<br/><br/>(Spoilers from hereon in!!)The world Pandora is amazing and you should see the movie just for that. The floating mountains and its weird inhabitants are mysterious and interesting. The horse-looking things look very realistic along with the flying things but it all sums up to fun. The soundtrack and music are the best I have heard in a long time in a movie because it gets wilder and adds more coolness when there is a big battle, like at the end. The battles were great since here weren't any boring action scenes and the film gets interesting after a battle. A lot more. If i could choose to watch Avatar again, I would happily decline since what I am doing right now. There are lots of styles in an action scene from fighting with bow and arrows to fighting with guns to using your body, this film really does contain ACTION. The film is too long and a few unnecessary scenes should be cut from the film because they don't offer anything except time wasting. Anyone who likes action, good music, big fights, weird rituals, and crazy scenery should definitely watch this movie because they will be blown away. The rest of them would find it long, boring, slow, dramatic, time wasting, ball-sucking, sh*tty acting, money wasting, sh*t tasting, sleep-making, rubbish, dumb, hilarious, retarded, bad graphics, and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Story - 6.5 Action - 7.5 Special effects - 9.0 Graphics - 7 Soundtrack - 9.0 Total - 7/10 - Could have been better!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is a special-effects laden adventure with a tiresome story. It is only the technical nous which gives Avatar a certain gravitas that one has to acknowledge. The 3D for all its efforts is not pioneering and the media fanfare seems to be misplaced.<br/><br/>Having watch Avatar the 3D effects are underwhelming. I have not seen any 3D films in recent years and was expecting technical wizardry, and effects which would revolutionise the cinematic experience. Instead although the effects are good and better than the standard fare it was a tremendous letdown. At times the images become blurry and in other intense action scenes rather messy. As the 3D effects did not meet the high expectations the story had to come more to the fore but its formulaic plot and threadbare story do little to propel or inject excitement.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the persistence to provide so much of Pandora and the Naavi way of life. It languishes in Pandora for so long that you begin to crave some human reality not the pomposity of how wonderful the world looks. The Naavi are not given enough screen-time for us to have a natural empathy for them, instead the film focuses on spirituality and the beauty of Pandora. The second-act is unashamedly stereotypical and preachy about the natural world. The second-half needed to inject fresh impetus after is initial technical offering but it plants itself in very run of the mill territory.<br/><br/>Avatar is overly long and overly dramatic. Unfortunately, its blanket of special effects stand alone in providing the entertainment factor as the structure of the story is weighed down in a very familiar formulaic manner.</div>,\n",

If you can find a IMAX theater within driving distance...make a day trip out of it.<br/><br/>The digital details of this movie has set a new standard for digital picture. Add to that that they did it in 3D !!! Ohh and it is not just a handful of shots in 3D...Just about every scene has 3D...in fact it is like you are watching the live movie being made, you truly feel immersed in the movie.<br/><br/>The story is very good, best summed up as Dances with wolves meets Starship Troopers. There is very good acting, with some distinguished voices like Sigourney Weaver, Wes Studi and CCH Pounder. I like that James Cameron filled most of the rolls with lesser known actors, so you can focus on the story.<br/><br/>There are Mechwarriors in the movie that are some of the best I have ever seen. Awesome.<br/><br/>The only minor quips I have are that the movie is long, which can become taxing on the eyes in 3D mode. Almost wished it was in 2 movies.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I agree fully with my friend Ian's statement: \"What 'Avatar' does is change the standard formula for making a big film.\" I was very impressed. I can't see a thing wrong with it, while having lots to praise.<br/><br/>Avatar has set the highest imaginable standard for the amount of detail and the attention to perfection applied in every aspect of the images (including the three dimensional aspect) and with similar attention devoted to the sound design.<br/><br/>I find it hard to understand those who could not appreciate that the three dimensional aspect was a valuable factor in at least 90% of the film.<br/><br/>I was happy that the Pandora flora and fauna looked much more realistic on the big screen than they do in the bits I've seen on TV, and it doesn't require much suspension of disbelief in the cinema.<br/><br/>This is a very sound story too - just with the invading humans getting much less punishment than they clearly deserved.<br/><br/>Today James Cameron announced that in mid-year he'll be doing a cinematic release of the \"director's cut\" - with 40 minutes extra footage. I'd be happy to see that too - but I sincerely hope that they include an intermission. Even the original edit tests the limits of bladder control.<br/><br/>Every minute and effort put into the making of Avatar has been well spent - and I am in awe of the proved skill and devotion.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Yes indeed, this film is the greatest piece of fiction ever to come out from any film industry I would say. The new world, their systems, their 'humans', the animals, the birds, a whole new language for God's sake! It is an amazing and out of the world piece of imagination, and I can't even begin to imagine how much of hard-work and dedication it must have required. It is the highest earning Hollywood film ever, an achievement fully deserved! Watching it for the third time in my life I went through the entire film with a smile on my face. A smile that one wears when you are really enjoying something, and I did every bit of just thinking that this dream-world is a product of someone's fantasies. It is the kind of film that I would stand up for at the end to clap in the theatre. The most impressive thing for me has to be its language. The production of those avatars just to be able to have people like them as well was quite unique I thought.<br/><br/>The most clever part of the film was, the person who later on turns to be one to stand in their favour and to appreciate their world, was shown as a physically disabled person, so he was in the best position to judge the physical beauty of the entirely different world. He was bound to appreciate it more just for the physical freedom and abilities that he could enjoy in it. Basically, his whole world had changed, making him automatically feel to belonging more to them than his former life and world.<br/><br/>The fact that we had here been thrown into an absolute new world meant that it needed for the to be as long in length as it was. So I am kind of coming up with a justification for the only flaw that I could think of.<br/><br/>All in all, it is stunning and more of an experience than a film, the kind of experience that I would get if I was to visit a country, or something.</div>,\n",

This IS a victory of style over substance and yadda yadda yadda...but there's enough just enough substance to sustain the story line, and the style alone is worth the price of admission. For those of us weaned on \"Star Wars\", welcome to the new paradigm.<br/><br/>Cameron, whether you love him or hate him, has changed the game with this puppy. From a purely technical standpoint, \"Avatar\" is absolute state of the art. Don't know if this flick will translate real well to your 36\" flat screen at home, but throw in some stadium seating, 3D, and a big screen, and this is a an \"E\" ride at Disney.<br/><br/>We all liked the circus when we were kids, so let's not pretend this ain't fun. Pretty colors, rhinos with hammerheads and floating mountains courtesy Roger Dean. What's not to love, huh? On a side note, the movie has pulled in about $1 billion in the first 2 weeks.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar, Avatar twinkling from afar. I wish I may, I wish I might review your wonder near as bright.<br/><br/>UPDATE: AFTER SEEING THIS AT A DIFFERENT THEATER, I WANT TO ADD THAT 3D EFFECTS WERE BETTER, AS WAS AUDIO, BUT IMPROVEMENTS ARE STILL NEEDED TO MAKE 3D A RELIABLE ACROSS THE BOARD STANDARD. BUT STILL AN EXCELLENT MOVIE.<br/><br/>This is not a negative review, so everyone can breathe free now. I liked the movie as it was done, Unfortunately, for those of us who can be overly analytical, I really think some things needed to be done to make it a better appreciated 3D movie. Perhaps I should say that I have my doubts about the capability of the theater I was at even though it is one of the newer ones. As a result, I have to see the movie again at another theater.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS HERE**** The 3D effects were good but with obvious fault. The less important, tiny features stood out better than the more important, screen filling creatures. Colorful plants were cute and charming, knives and arrows pointed at the screen seemed almost real and disarming. Flying and falling, which I thought would thrill, were flat, giving me little more than a chill. Running through the jungle was exhausting to say the least, dodging bushes, branches, huge trees and wild beasts.<br/><br/>Seriously, after all the hype and high expectations I did find some things that needed more attention. For a true 3D movie, I wanted 3D sound as well. The beasts and huge machines that should have made the ground tremble and send sounds of thunder were not as impressive as they could have been. It seemed that more attention was given to vision than to the audio and it was way too noticeable. Again, I will be seeing Avatar at another theater which may correct that problem. However, I am not able to see Avatar at IMAX, so that's out.<br/><br/>While the Na'vi were well done, I didn't see the advantage to watching in 3D as opposed to seeing it in digital. I could have been happier seeing it in digital because I would have been less critical of the faults of 3D. Not that I disliked the effort, because I think Cameron did a great job - much better than most other directors probably would have done. But he could have used something that J. J. Abrams used, flaring or glaring flashes of light that gave screen images the appearance of being lively. Abrams may have used it a little too much in Star Trek, but it worked very well. It's just that bright lights in Avatar were not as bright or real as they could have been.<br/><br/>While the story was good, it was a little much to see military and corporate people in the year 2154 being so cruel and soulless as some appeared. I do not believe we can be such idiots so far into the future. The Na'vi were much more appealing and spiritual. Their desire to work with nature gave them a definite advantage in the \"smarts\" department. I was wondering why no one gave Enya a vocal part during rituals at the tree of souls. She would have fit beautifully. Yeah, that's right, I like Enya. And yeah, that's right, I am saying this is somewhat of a chick flick with heart and soul. At least Avatar has huge battles and Tarzan-like scenes with wild animals doing harm to man-kind. And there were wild animals that were tamed and loved. So there was definite balance.<br/><br/>So, to finish, I say see Avatar. It is a very good movie and 3D effects were very good but they also missed the mark when it came to getting the full affect from visual and audio immersion. That's not a complaint, just an observation. I hope Cameron continues in this effort to perfect 3D because I think he can do it after learning from his mistakes.<br/><br/>Even after all the things I did not like, my love for the movie as a whole I am glad to give this a 9/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I was reluctant to go see this as I'm not sold on the 3D craze, which is currently sweeping the cinema-world. I had seen \"Up\" and \"Fly me to the moon\" before this and was expecting more or less the same. In my opinion, that's what I got.<br/><br/>James Cameron is a master at creating stories, characters and relationships which the viewer can empathise with. He's no genius but he is solid.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that Avatar is now the biggest grossing movie of all time. It's got all the ingredients of a mainstream smash and almost executes to perfection, but that's all it is really. Elements of the story are terribly clichéd; some parts are borderline silly, and there's nothing in the action sequences we haven't seen elsewhere before, it's just bigger and more 3d-er in this movie. It could also arguably be a bit shorter. I did find myself yawning on the odd occasion.<br/><br/>For kids (eg 7-15), this would be the ride of a lifetime. It's a bit too rough for younger viewers but the editing has been handled really well, to make this accessible for a wide demographic. There's no blood n' guts but it's not exactly the A-Team either. Think \"Return of the King\" and you've got a similar level of violence.<br/><br/>To summarise, it's great but not mind-blowing. As for the 3D, I found that by the end, I was oblivious to it, which is the same for good old 2D.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Pandora is a wondrous place that expands the imagination. I really enjoyed the idea that the Navi would make physical contact with the Banshee and sort of \"mind meld\" for flight together. The sparkle that emitted from the trees as they ran was like phosphorescence in the ocean. In fact a lot of Pandora reminded me of life under water (we SCUBA in our family). Sadly that's where the positive ends for me.<br/><br/>I thought the story lacked character development; the audience has to fill in a lot of story line and history, and the worst part was how evil were painted the humans. They were written as barbarians without concern for the Navi which I just don't find believable. Seems like a political statement was behind the writing.<br/><br/>Lastly I found the 3D distracting. I think the 3D push is coming from the studios rather than from the audience. Certainly there will be a segment of the population that is enamored by 3D but overall I'm quite happy with 2D. For me the story line is much more important than the image. I can still enjoy old black &amp; white movies if the story is believable and the direction is done well. I went to the 3D showing and paid $3 extra out of curiosity but won't do that again. If this is the best the industry has to offer, and I found it distracting, then there is no reason to be curious again.<br/><br/>One thought lingers about the movie. I didn't feel there was anywhere for this to go in the future. Star Trek and Star Wars always left me wanting more. I would like more of Pandora and the Navi but the plot just didn't lend itself to a follow up. So I am left feeling detached from it rather than a part of a movement.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">An 85 minute movie expanded to 2 and a half hours. James \"Titanic\" Cameron's less than titanic effort has a paralyzed marine being sent to the Planet Pandora to fetch a substance that can be used as an energy source on a fuel hungry Earth in the future. The CGI effects are OK-but they wear their welcome out fast. The trite and very hackneyed story seems to have been lifted from Dances With Wolves,Pocohontas, Alien, Cameron's own Aliens,The Lost World, Atlantis-The Lost Empire , Journey to the Center of the Earth,and the Wizard Of Oz-especially for the first 20 or so minutes that are filmed in standard format before the film goes CGI,kind of like the black and white opening of Oz before Dorothy arrives there and it goes to color. The planet Pandora itself features flying dragons and blue indigenous natives that are a poor parody of American Indians. It seems as if Cameron is saying that only the white race of people can be the saviors of this world, and that even though the indigenous peoples are very smart, they just don't have the intelligence to fend or themselves.All the clichés are there, the love interest, the greedy industrialist, the strong , liberated woman, etc, etc. For a short time it is eye popping, even dazzling, but from then on it slowly sinks{get it?} into its own pretensions.Worse still, there really is no sense of humor or comedy relief to lighten things up a bit. Its as if Cameron is saying \"wow, just look at it. It's awesome, isn't it?\". Well, the real fact of the matter is that it is not. Cameron has always been a props and FX director and still has a lot to learn about the human element and character development . Since this ass-buster runs for what seems to be an eternity, why didn't he attempt to make the characters interesting? He knows that today's multiplex bred filmgoers just don't seem to care so he takes the easy way out and gives us an FX movie that is just overkill.It is all style, no substance and leaves you with a cold and empty feeling. I'm sure this movie will probably do good in the awards department, but that does not justify you giving up two and a half hours of your life to see it.You've seen it all before-and much better too.Even the current Planet 51-a not too good sci-fi parody -comedy of an astronaut landing on a planet where the aliens are based on 1950s American pop culture offers some fun and laughs manages to outshine this. This film is just so ordinary that it is a crime.See it if you like-just don't expect too much. Cameron thinks that the CGI effects of this film will be \"the next big thing in film-making\" Guess again James.If you can wait 9 or so weeks, you'll be able to rent this at Blockbuster.WARNING! Do NOT take little children to see this movie. They will become just as bored as you-only faster.My rating-one star.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">There were disappointments, but I'll save those for last ...<br/><br/>I went to this screening with higher expectations than I had for any film in quite a long time. I opted for the 3-D version to see how 3-D has progressed and was not disappointed. In fact, I was very pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of the 3-D presentation. The technique was better integrated into this film than any other example I've seen; creating a nice standard text on things to do right if you want to make a good quality 3-D movie. Most films seem to add 3-D as an afterthought, barely making any impact on the presentation and sadly lacking imagination and creativity. That was not true with this offering, it was very creative and superbly imaginative. Avatar is a stunningly creative integration of the 3-D effect into the entire scope of the film to sometimes breathtaking result.<br/><br/>That being said, lets explore the rest of the film: I did love the rest of the CGI effects, the best I've seen to date in any film. The look of the planet imagined here is the best I've seen - I wonder what Ray Harryhausen thinks of the current state of the art as seen here? The sets, in fact, the whole visual presentation apart from the 3-D were equally outstanding. Saying it is a visually stunning, superb film would not be too effusive in praise.<br/><br/>The cast was excellent throughout, creating a wonderful film that will doubtless become a classic. Stephen Lang did a masterful job with the Colonel Miles Quaritch character, injecting just enough sinister personality to make a worthy antagonist to the bluish aliens; the Na'vi on the planet Pandora. Hardest to judge were the characters of Jake Sully, portrayed by Sam Worthington, and Neytiri, played with great gusto by the exotic and erotic Zoe Saldana. My problem with these characters is I don't know where their craft as actors departed from the CGI. The end results, however, were wonderful characters with more depth than one usually finds in science fiction films; especially Saldana's contribution. Zoe Saldana managed to make her character charmingly feminine and sexy as well as fiercely brave and courageous; something most actresses have trouble doing credibly in action movies. Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chacon, and Giovanni Ribisi as the patently evil Parker Selfridge were all outstanding; adding a lot to the film's realism and credibility.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but notice how scrupulously careful the makers were to avoid showing even a glimpse of an alien breast - I suppose there are Christian censors on Pandora too. I imagine many will think the Na'vi were styled after African and Native American culture. Perhaps they'd be right. I think it must have been difficult to concoct too exotic of an alien culture or it may have been too time consuming to present. It is at least solidly done and well constructed.<br/><br/>One thing that must be applauded is the richness of the flora and fauna created for the planet Pandora. The film makers outdid themselves in that department; doing so well that at times the abundance and richness they injected into the film nearly overshadow the rest of what was going on in the film. Great touches in that regard was how small objects, insects, floating leaves, etc., were used to enhance the 3-D effects to stunning success.<br/><br/>I'm likely in a very small minority of film goers who are disappointed with anything in this film. It undeniably outshines even the classics like Star Wars. Still, it missed the mark for me in a couple of areas. The elements that really let me down (more disappointing than I can describe) were the overall technology depictions of the earth people - referred to by the Na'vi as \"sky people\". Considering that the time-frame when this story was supposed to take place is 2154, 145 years from now, some of what the film makers chose to depict as examples of the preeminent technology of that time were terribly late-twentieth century-ish.<br/><br/>I may be prejudiced by having spent decades working with the military's most technologically advanced weapon systems, but it didn't seem to me that it should be so much of a stretch to do better considering the effort that went into every other element of the film. For example, I know how to creatively solve the problem of interstellar travel in a much more entertaining way and hoped someone in the film's production end would catch on, but it wasn't to be.<br/><br/>Also disappointing were the rather contemporary - to our time - communications, weapons and aircraft; there won't be anything like what they chose 145 years from now. And the oxygen masks; not very creative there either.<br/><br/>Last, but certainly not least, were the disappointingly 20th century clothing. I certainly would have liked more imagination there. Perhaps the most noticeable example being the strategically snipped wife-beater that Michelle Rodriguez wore.<br/><br/>I did like the visuals for what they did with the computer depictions but I think even those could have been done better.<br/><br/>Well, maybe next time . . .<br/><br/>The disappointments were easily forgivable (even the uncomfortable 3-D glasses were forgotten shortly into the film) considering the tremendous overall visual quality of every single thing they put on screen. There are not enough words of praise to adequately recommend this film as great entertainment with the caveat that in spite of the PG-13 rating and the exclusion of bluish alien breasts, it is very violent; so some parents may wish to consider that before toddling their offspring off to a Saturday afternoon at the movies.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I must say that even though i really wanted to watch this movie,i still expected it to suck!I think that in these days,big budget movies are usually being eaten by great visuals.By that i mean that visuals oftenly distract you from holes in the script.And i can't say that,that's not the question with this movie too.Avatar is definitely not a movie that shows us something new in the way of storytelling or even the general idea!It's pretty obvious that it's been highly influenced by such movies as Dances With Wolves!To be completely honest,the only thing that's flawless in this movie are visuals!And they are so,so great.Especially in 3-D.But still,i really can't find a reason that would make me hate this movie.Maybe that's because i didn't expect it to be as good as James Cameron said it will be,i don't know.<br/><br/>Avatar is a very interesting and tense movie with a predictable plot and bad character development!And even though i gave it nine,i still must admit that it DOESN'T DESERVE IT.At least not for what was said it will be because if you judge it by that,you will definitely be disappointed.It's a classic story with a classic ending and everything else except for the revolutionary visuals!But it's still very,very enjoyable to watch.And even though the characters were very shallow in a way that they're not complexed enough or maybe even at all,they're still quiet lovely and interesting and you will definitely care for them.Just as for the entire Na'vi civilization which is pretty well described in the movie but also obviously influenced by the native Americans or should i say indians!<br/><br/>I can find a large number of mistakes that this movie has.I can also name at least ten movies that obviously influenced James Cameron to make this one.But i wont.Instead i'm just gonna take it for what it is and enjoy it's thousand times already seen but still beautiful story!This movie is definitely my recommendation to everyone.Just don't expect it to be what James Cameron said it will be because you might and probably will be disappointed.Except for the visuals!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">When I first heard that James Cameron was doing a sci-fi movie again, I was surprised. Because the last film he did was the 1997 classic, \"Titanic\". After watching, \"Avatar\", this is what I said, \"I love this movie\".<br/><br/>The reason why I love this movie, is the visuals. They were really amazing. Also the acting was great. Sam Worthington does a great job as Jake Sulley and Zoe Saldana does a nice job as Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver also does a good job as her character. Plus, the action scene's were great. We have seven to ten foot blue aliens fighting humans in giant robots. Nuff said. The story was also good. I didn't care if people thought the story was a rip-off of the Disney film Pocahontas or Ferngully.<br/><br/>Overall, \"Avatar\", is a great movie that is definitely worth watching.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It goes without saying that the special effects were astounding, but I found myself just as riveted by Avatar's all out attack on a breed of small-minded, petty people who spoil the Earth yet proudly wave the flag, believing they're the Chosen Ones. They deserve zero respect for their rapacious attitudes, among which is the denial of any man-made errors, like AGW.<br/><br/>The bad guys in this film are the same types who nearly wiped out the bison in the 1800s, and, at the time of this writing, have done a real number on the Gulf of Mexico's waters. They can also be found spewing lies against the environment on talk shows hosted on networks owned by their kind.<br/><br/>To disrespect the very thing that keeps you alive in the name of money &amp; false pride is evil. The value system of these people is beyond corrupt.<br/><br/>Yes, there were a number of clichés and strong similes in this film, but all seemed justified. Let's hope more filmmakers have the guts to go all out and not soft-peddle the phony \"conservatives\" of the world who don't want to conserve anything but greed and avarice.<br/><br/>Very good work, Mr. Cameron!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">You will surely be mesmerized by the visual scenes in James Cameron's Avatar.But it's not the script that hooks and magnetizes you.I feel that special effects for that matter are the trappings used to embellish a movie and they work only if a movie has a rock-solid base content. Unfortunately, Avatar gives more preference to special effects, while the writing takes a complete backseat.Avatar is merely a long, boring, silly and expensive excuse to find a new type of movie.Dialogues are irritating with nothing new and exciting to offer. James Cameron has undoubtedly put in a lot of effort and hard work into his new movie Avatar, whether it's the costumes, settings, and special effects.There's no denying that James Cameron's intentions are genuine and noble, but, seriously, did the Oscar winning director of Titanic got carried away by special effects? No doubt, the basic idea sounds interesting and the viewer would love to be a participant in this movie but what comes across is amateurish.Unfortunately, the script is way below average. The story is nonsensical, the story lacks soul, you don't feel for any single character in the movie. James Cameron as a story teller fails big time. The first half is never ending, but towards the end it gets even more boring. Imagining life many years from now is exciting, but what unfolds on the screen in the second half is probably equivalent to a third degree torture. It painfully drags, the special effects although great, outshines the story and you no more care for any of the characters. The special effects too starts to get monotonous towards the end. 30 minutes into the second half, you desperately await the end for the credits to roll. Yes, it's that bad! In short, Avatar is yet another major disappointment of 2009. A utter waste of so much money spent on this never ending tale. This futuristic tale has absolutely no future! On the whole,Avatar rests on a thin plot and that would curtail it's reach to a major extent.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron's Avatar is probably one of the most overrated movies of the last decade. Avatar is the textbook definition of style over substance. The film is cool visuals and decent action and that is all. The film has no interesting characters, the villains are all comical stereotypes with no dimension at all, and it is predictable from beginning to end. The plot of this film has been done to death in tons of other films, so there are no surprises. This film does not deserve to be the highest grossing film ever. Plus the film is way too long. Many scenes could have been cut and it would have been the same movie.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the plot, which is extremely predictable. From the first ten minutes I could guess how the film would play out and I was right. The plot is basically the plot of Dances with Wolves but with aliens instead of Native Americans. You have a soldier who is hired to drive the natives off the land. However, as the film goes on he befriends the natives and learns of their culture. Eventually he joins the natives and fights his own people. I would not be so upset if they just took a few elements from Dances with Wolves. However, Avatar is Dances with Wolves, just with aliens. There is almost no difference at all.<br/><br/>What's worse is that the characters are really lame. Sam Worthington's character is generic and not interesting at all. Sam Worthington does not do a horrible job performance wise, but half of the time he looks like he is ready for lunch. His character is the stereotypical good guy and the fish-out-of-water. He is also kind of an idiot. For example, that scene when he first is transferred into the avatar body and has legs is cringe-worthy and goes on for too long. He just behaves like a little kid that got his new toy. The supporting characters are boring as well. Many of them are just devices used to move the plot along like Michelle Rodriguez's character. Sigourney Weaver is in this too. She does fine but she cannot save the cast.<br/><br/>The villains are even worse. They are unbelievable stereotypical and one-dimensional. One of the villains played by Giovanni Ribisi is just the stereotypical rich guy who only cares about money. The other big villain played by Stephen Lang is the over-the-top one-dimensional general who wants to destroy the Navi civilization for no other reason than he is the bad guy of the movie. These seem more like Captain Planet villains than ones you would see in a supposedly adult film like this.<br/><br/>It is a shame because James Cameron used to know how to write good characters. He wrote Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Hudson from Aliens. He also created iconic characters like Sarah Connor and John Connor from Terminator. Cameron could also write good villains like the T-1000 from Terminator 2 or Burk from Aliens. Now he seems to care more for the effects and the spectacle of a movie rather than the story and character. With both this and Titanic before Cameron has given us oversimplified characters that are mostly there for forced drama and/or to drive home a message that you see on countless after school specials. He had fifteen years to work on Avatar, so there is no excuse for a predictable story and bland characters like what we have here. He obviously cared more about making the effects look amazing (which they do) and the story and characters were just an afterthought.<br/><br/>There are good things about the film. The effects look amazing. Pandora is very colorful, unique, and pleasing to the eye. I have not seen it in 3D, but I heard that it was pretty good. The acting is fine except from Sam Worthington. It also has some decent action, particularly at the end with the final battle. The film has some entertaining parts like some parts at the beginning and the final fight. Many people who defend this movie say that it is more about the experience of being on Pandora.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a good experience in the theater, but that does not mean that the film is good. A film needs more than spectacle to be good. There are lots of films where I had a good experience watching the film in theaters, but as I thought about it more and watched it again at home I find that the film is not that good. X-Men Origins Wolverine is a film that quickly comes to mind. I did not even have that great of an experience watching it in the theater actually. It was fun to look at, but the story and characters were too bland for me, and I was just bored. I found this to be a very boring movie.<br/><br/>Overall, if you want to sit through two hours and forty minutes of eye candy then by all means see the film, although most people have seen the film by now. I personally, found Avatar to be an extremely long, predictable, simplistic, boring movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">3D ERA OPENERS to WORLD\n",
       " There isnt much I would dislike about the movie hence rated 10.<br/><br/>I hope the story part could have been not so stretched, still the 3D thing took it over.<br/><br/>I watched this movie nearly 17 times lol to enjoy the graphical effects in various theaters in my country.\n",
       " Never thought, a new ERA WAS BORN with this LEGACY</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">By definition, an avatar is a descendant who is a modified reincarnation of an ancestor. The definition really doesn't apply to the characters in Avatar who assume alien form to survive in a hostile planetary environment; they're more like participants in a virtual reality environment. Rather, the definition applies to the movie \"Avatar\" as a whole. As I saw it, \"Avatar\" is an avatar, in a way, of Star Wars. While \"Star Wars\" took the framework and concepts of King Arthur and Camelot and placed it in space, \"Avatar\" took the framework and concepts of cowboys and mystical Native Americans and placed it in space.<br/><br/>Therefore, you have, as I believe Boston Herald critic James Verniere put it, \"Dances with Giant Blue Ewoks\", which is a rather comprehensive description. The only tweak is that instead of traditional cowboys, we have the traditional bullheaded military/industrial complex obsessed with conquest and pillage. So, as a majority of the posters here have sagaciously observed, originality is not \"Avatar\"'s strong suit. But then again, was \"Star Wars\" original? The only original movie is arguably the first one ever made, and even it had to borrow from oral and written folklore and stories.<br/><br/>Okay, enough digression. \"Avatar\" is certainly derivative, but is it any good? It's astonishingly very good I think, because James Cameron is not only a master of technology, but also good storytelling. As you felt for Luke as he journeyed toward adulthood and his Jedi destiny, you will feel for quadriplegic Jake as he gropes his way forward towards physical independence, love, and defense of a higher spiritual good. Sure, you've seen these morality tales before, but seldom with such impeccable CGI (and 3D) depictions, intense characterizations of both human and the alien Na'vi, unrelenting adventure and violence, and compelling spirituality (\"God does not take sides, but preserves the universal balance\"). \"Star Wars\" had these elements, and of course soared to popular and critical acclaim. \"Avatar\", \"Star Wars\"'s avatar, of course duplicated this feat, even more so.<br/><br/>P.S.: Pandora strongly reminded me of a planet you would find in the \"Star Wars\" mythos. Wishful thinking, of course, since they are separated by immense time periods, but I would find a \"Star Wars\"/\"Avatar\" crossover interesting.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Movies like Avatar make me miss going to the theaters. Let's hope things will turn around in 2021 so the new movie can be released because I'm really looking forward to it. Avatar represents the very best of watching a movie on the big screen. Years after I watched it on the big screen I saw it on television and it didn't capture the magic at all. It felt so puny when compared to the experience in the theater. In IMAX 3D it was amazing. I still vividly remember the experience. It was like you were really there in this huge, immersive world. Cameron's movie was a mega success and deservedly so because it really did change the movie landscape. It was a marvelous technical achievement. And the story was also pretty good as it had a deeper message. A classic.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">So I watched 2009's Avatar well is it an instant classic well yeah. Is it the best movie ever no! So why a classic. Well this movie was the first really to fully utilize modern 3-d and has done it in a way that was very satisfying, especially since this review is based on my second watching in 2d. Also the animation is spectacular from start to finish. When I think of the artistry that goes into just one second of a movie like this my mind gets blown man. So why is this movie not the best ever, well several reasons but lets focus on some core things, one it is pretty predictable, two the story though original contains many not so original concepts. Well what does \"two\" mean, well if you change the Na'vi to American Indians you have the plot to almost every movie done about the white man versus the American Indian. Also, if you replace the other main plot point, the need for a greedy nation to have power both literally and figuratively, you have the plot of any anti American movie dealing with the middle east. However, the Na'vi and their world are beyond interesting, and the incorporation by Cameron of both the sci-fi elements he has explored in the past and his love of \"aliens of the deep\" make this a very satisfying ride. At the end of the day you have to remember this is basically a kids movie, so to look to harshly through any other lens is sort of off the mark. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The return of James Cameron to the great cinema, with the movie Avatar, and what a return. Avatar is simply something unprecedented, Cameron excelled, he takes on the story of Pocahontas (more or less) and makes a MASTERPIECE.<br/><br/>Cameron has created an entire world that is Pandora, with places full of mysteries to unravel (more or less like a second Middle Earth), but in a world totally different and beautiful to look at. The film's visual effects are simply PERFECT. Not only, but created a language and a people, the Navi. The way that Cameron creates is that people master, are a people \"indigenous-alien\" with its own language, which seems so real throughout the film. The film is not only real but also in environment the people themselves, the dialogs between the characters are so real that when you watch your mind looks like it will explode. Just proves that James Cameron is a master at doing more screenplays. The soundtrack nor comet, simply perfect, is one of the other to exciting and dramatic. The cast think it's fantastic, could not ask for more. Sam Worthington proves he can be a really good actor; Zoe Saldana continues be sexy even when she is in a blue-alien body; and we still have Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Giovanni Ribisi, all doing an amazing job.<br/><br/>All in all, I think \"Avatar\" is amazing and epic, a real MASTERPIECE from cinema by James Cameron, where I laughed, cried and jump of my chair throughout the all movie, I fell in love with the characters, and Pandora, and I'm anxious to get back to it, we see how there will be sequels.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I haven't seen many films in 3-D since it became newly fashionable. This was the first, and best.<br/><br/>The film's technical credentials are so awesome that I'll begin with them. Visually, the film is simply stunning (in 2-D and on Blu-Ray too). Our hero, Jake Sully, is linked to an avatar so that he can penetrate and explore pristine forest on the alien world of Pandora and persuade the native people to move, thus allowing mineral companies in to exploit the planet, some of which is, of course, sacred.<br/><br/>He ends up lost in the forest and it is from that moment that the film's stunning visuals really take hold. The light is haunting and the forest's animal and insect inhabitants look truly alive.<br/><br/>Accompanying the visuals is some of the loveliest film music I have heard in a long time – maybe since \"Gladiator\". It is haunting when it needs to be, uplifting when it needs to be, sad when it needs to be – at all times, adding to the magic of what we're seeing. I don't buy film music much these days, but this CD was playing in my car the same day I saw the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story has nothing much to recommend it. As I was watching it, I thought \"'Dances With Wolves' in Outer Space\", a description that seems to have occurred to others too. \"Avatar\" contains every cliché and ill-informed prejudice – primitives good, civilization bad – that Kevin Costner's earlier film contained and is just as crass in showing the effect they have on each other. To that extent, it might as well have been made in monochrome. A correspondingly average script doesn't give the actors much to work with and their performances are no better than satisfactory.<br/><br/>But it's worth seeing AND hearing all the same. Think I'll watch it again this weekend\n",
       " <br/><br/>Rating: 7/10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I knew from the trailer it would have been a good one, but I didn't know how much I would love it. My idea of a good movie is the essence of something that has originality, insatiable acting and a whimsical storyline, something that I couldn't come up with myself. This movie really had me thinking of the possibility of another world like this one. James Cameron; the writer and director of this film found a way to create a mystical plot, beyond anyone's imagination unto the screen for us to enjoy and lament upon. Even the love story is unique and sensational, beyond words.<br/><br/>I immediately did research upon returning from the movies, because I really enjoyed this one. I learned about the techniques used to digitize each actor and actress into their 'Na'vi' form and the exceptionally attractive artwork. I further discovered that the writer behind this movie had it set for release in 1999, but held it off until now because the technology introduced would not be as open to us now. We have seen many movies that presented technology that literally left you flabbergasted at the endeavor to create something beyond belief, but 'Avatar' would take your breath away.<br/><br/>The names and the language within the movie would leave you wondering whether this language was 'the real deal'. I discovered that the language and culture of the 'Na'vi' was developed by Cameron himself. This creativity and professionalism was presented by Cameron in other films, but this one takes the cake.<br/><br/>Set way into the future the plot revolves around the Na'vi and their homeland Pandora. Pandora itself speaks of a box which holds the evils of mankind and once opened, all the evils would be revealed. The choice of Pandora reflects the actual lifestyle of the Na'vi after the humans invaded their homeland.<br/><br/>This type of inner depth which director James Cameron chose to develop was what impressed me most. I appreciated the relationship between Neytiri and Jake Sully. Sully himself was simple minded, but according to director Cameron; Sully would be 'a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world'. Very few movies com along like this one often and I was hooked from beginning to end. I remember a particular scene while the humans reigned doom on the Na'vi's and took away their promised tree, I had grown attached to these people so much that their pain was shared and Neytiri's expression and passion for her culture was welcomed with open arms.<br/><br/>The Na'vi are essentially a huge family with deep ties among each other. It was amazing how open they were to teach others their traditions and were willing to merge 'an outsider' into their family. I can't grasp officially how the creation of this culture was done off screen, but I could truly believe and accept the possibility of there being a culture like the Na'vi out; a twelve feet tall race open to culture and nature. Their world actually seemed more functional and less complicated than the actual human lifestyle.<br/><br/>There were a few inconsistencies within the movie, at least there were a few that others pointed out, that I couldn't have really cared less about. Sometimes when you are so in to a movie you begin to lose any curiosity into plot developments and just 'go with the flow'. There were such few, but the ones pointed out detailed the inability of the Na'vi's arrows to penetrate the flying machines in the first war fight and in the fight with Sully as lead, they easily penetrated the windscreens. My theory in defense of them would be the positions they captured in the first fight; it was weak and unplanned and the distance barely gave any harm, especially since they had no clear view of the screens and aimed relentlessly. A second inconsistency pointed out dealt with the humans' inability to breathe without their masks and then we have them breathing without out their masks in the end. My theory to counter that would entail a bit of uncertainty, but on top of that Cameron did list the possibility of sequel movies and maybe all of those would be explained.<br/><br/>If it were me alone none of those mattered at all and the best parts of the movie, which is everything else, made me fall for it deeply beyond words. I would forever cherish one of the best couples created on screen; Neytiri and Sully. I admired the way Neytiri referred to Sully as 'Her Jake', which reenacted their love for each other and made me ignore the possibility for them to be together given Sully's situation. What impressed me further would have been the scene where Sully began to suffocate for air and Neytiri hurried to save him. Despite the fact that she realized his true form, she still loved him; she didn't mind holding a small man in her arms. To her it wasn't a small man, but 'Her Jake', however mushy that sounded.<br/><br/>However soon the sequels arrive on screen, I would be one of the many awaiting in hope that they are perceived just as well as the first. I actually began this review a week ago and bit by bit, it came along. I just needed to get the words right and made sure the movie sunk in enough and I love it even more.<br/><br/>Lexa Reviews <br/><br/>http://lexabuti.blogspot.com <br/><br/>___________<br/><br/>Five Stars<br/><br/>Grade A++ <br/><br/>___________</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">With this film, Cameron has truly pushed the envelope in terms of computer-generated imagery, in ways that special effect companies could only dream of when the first motion-captured computer-generated character, Gollum, hit our screens back in 2002. Avatar features a 40%-60% divide in which a majority of scenes in the film take place in entirely CG-created environments, and I have to say that, objectively, it is absolutely impossible to tell the difference. Whereas so many movies are still struggling with convincing, realistic CGI – computer-generated creatures, animals or other imagery are always painfully obvious to me – it is absolutely stunning to see a film in which the CG-generated imagery is so photo-realistic, laypeople could easily mistake the 12-foot-tall blue aliens featured at the center of the film as really good make-up jobs. The effects team behind the movie has managed to include an unprecedented amount of detail into the CG-created environment and characters that every frame of the film has something fascinating to notice, be it the wrinkles and imperfections in the Na'vi skin to background movements in the deepest reaches of the CG jungle. And the fact that Cameron blocks these scenes just as he would in live-action, utilizing the same camera movements and a surprising amount of \"handheld\" photography, makes the effects work even more impressive and convincing. The greatest achievement of the film, though, is definitely the motion capture work. Throughout film history I have only ever encountered two entirely CG-created characters that convinced me so much with their emotions and evoked such a strong emotive connection that I had completely forgotten they were computer-generated: Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the aliens from this year's District 9, specifically Christopher Johnson, Wikus' sidekick. But with Avatar, Cameron has managed to create an entire population of CG-created characters that, with the help of the latest motion capture technology, move, behave and most importantly, convey emotions and facial expressions in an almost eerily realistic way, leagues ahead of the expressionless faces in other motion-capture films. If anything will be said about this film down the line, it will be that it was no less than a groundbreaking technical achievement.<br/><br/>What's so great about Avatar, though, is that it isn't just a technical achievement. Anyone could find a way to showcase the latest special effects technology without investing in anything else besides the technology. But Cameron is a storyteller, and he sets out to use these new, groundbreaking techniques to bring the mass audience something they have never seen before. Cameron is no stranger to pushing the envelope in this way: The Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Titanic were all groundbreaking films that pushed computer-generated imagery to higher and higher levels; but what made all those films work was the fact that they showed us things we had never seen before. The scale of the Titanic. The mechanics of the Terminators. The expansive underwater world. In Avatar, Cameron and his design crew set out to create a world we have never seen before. I have read a few articles criticizing the art design on the film, from the creatures who are all pretty much weirder counterparts of Earthbound fauna, to the ecosystem which is basically just a larger-scale Earth jungle. While all of this may be true, I still think that the world is so rich, from the Na'vi culture to the look and feel of the alien plants and creatures, to the fascinating secret the planet and the Na'Vi keep which is revealed to be a strikingly clever and interesting concept, that it is absolutely impossible to dismiss it as anything less than breathtaking. And the envelope-pushing special effects and 3-D photography only help to immerse the audience into every detail of this new and incredible world Cameron and crew have created.<br/><br/>All this admiration is not to say that the film is not without its flaws. Cameron is very open about the fact that he makes movies catered for mass-audience consumption. What he won't mention and what is also probably his biggest flaw is that he totally underestimates said audience, and writes a script using an over-simplified version of a very familiar premise, stock characters, cheesy dialogue and shameless kitsch thinking that these are the only ways to sell a story to the general public. I think that the box office success of films such as The Dark Knight prove that the mass audience is hungry for meaty, intelligent, deep blockbusters, but Cameron is a romantic and a classicist at heart, and he goes with what's familiar and what he knows will work. The plot of the film, after all, is really just another version of the Dances with Wolves/Pocahontas story but set on an alien world and in the future – ignorant white man is sent out to spy on indigenous culture by infiltrating their numbers, only to fall in love with the values they represent and lead them into battle against his previous comrades. Every plot development is entirely predictable; every element introduced in the first act is so conveniently brought back in the third to help the protagonists. Cameron can't resist including a romantic sub-plot, inspirational speeches, or cheesy and totally kitschy exchanges. He also can't resist making his antagonists so inhumanly evil that they become nothing more than exaggerated caricatures of evil. But I can't deny that I wasn't nonetheless swept away in the epic adventure, and the films visuals are just so rich and so new and so unique and beautiful and mesmerizing and inspiring, and its technical achievements so weighty and grand and important, and the set pieces so effectively put together, so thrilling and sweeping and action-packed, and the performances and motion capture work so pitch-perfect (except for Sam Worthington, who for some reason still just annoys me), that it's impossible not to treat this film like the groundbreaking cinematic event that it is.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I must say Avatar has changed cinema as we know it. And Hollywood will really need to step it up if any film will have any chance of beating Avatar in the box office. This is the film of the decade, by far. But now I will review this as a movie. How is it? It's pretty enjoyable, the world of Pandora is just breath-taking. But what really did it for me was the uniqueness of the story and the make of the film. There is no other film like it. I'll be honest, this movie was nearly perfect. Why? By just looking at it and witnessing the character development and the land of Pandora seems to feel like a character in the movie. You feel sad when their (spoiler) land gets destroyed and the Tree of Life gets knocked down. I don't want to spoil anything else. But experiencing this film is right now a moment to see something inspirational. You won't regret seeing this film, even if you don't like it, you still will admit that it wasn't that horrible. I recommend this to anyone. Enjoy!!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Strangely enough, I think, at least from one angle, the movie most similar to this one is American Beauty. Both movies were loved when they were released and hailed as some of the greatest achievements in all of cinema. But as the years passed, the backlash set in ans soon enough, you couldn't throw a stone without hitting someone who didn't like these movies.<br/><br/>Not that this isn't also true for a lot of other movies, including Titanic, Little Miss Sunshine, and, more recently, Frozen, all of which are on this list. But all those movies still have sizable fandoms.Not so for American Beauty, a movie you have to look around to find fans of. And certainly not so for Avatar, a movie in which you have to practically be Indiana Jones to find fans of, at least on the internet. For all the technological innovations it brought upon the industry, it is a movie that not a lot of people seem to like. Basically, it is the answer to the question, \"What would LOTR's impact have been on the world if it had been disliked?\" When you say that you like this movie, the first thing that a lot of people say is that, \"But...don't you see that it's just Fern Gully (a movie that I first learned about by these comparisons), Pocahontas (Eh), and Dances With Wolves (a movie I like better than you and did not find that boring even though I watched the four-hour long version). It's not original.\" (Malice is not intended, but feel free to read that in the most whiny voice possible.) Yes, it is like those movies. You fools might think that you're the explorer of your generation by realizing that. But let me break it to you: your beloved Star Wars/LOTR/Indiana Jones/ Whatever is a lot like a number of movies too.<br/><br/>As I said in the ESB Review, there are few big budget adventure movies that are quite like other movies from decades back and books from centuries back and plays from millennia back. There are a certain amount of stories and elements that just stick close to peoples' hearts. And so those are repeated again and again. Not that this is a bad thing. I adore LOTR and many other movies that follow this formula. If you want to hate Avatar, fine, I don't care. It's not even my favorite thing with 'Avatar' in its name. But hate it for reasons that are more fully fleshed out than \"It ripped off X and Y.\" By the way, after you read this review, I highly recommend reading Joseph Campbell's' Monomyth if you haven't already. It's the definitive work on what I've just described.<br/><br/>So now that I've thrown darts at some of the reasons why people hate this movie... I suppose that I should now say why I like it. Here we go. It's not the main character, who is as forgettable as any. The rest of the actors are good and are able to elevate a middling script (people don't watch Cameron movies for the writing, though in this, as in his other movies, it's fine) but they are not great. The top honors go to Zoe Saldana, who takes a rather flat role and infuses it with humor and wit and some majesty.<br/><br/>The music is enough to carry the film at parts. James Horner (who died just this year; RIP) puts together one of his most masterful scores. That statement is impressive considering that this a man who scored more great movies than many people have even watched and who composed the Titanic soundtrack, which sold more copies than any other mostly orchestral soundtrack in history. It feels tribal and majestic yet lively and energetic, and is a good fit for the film as well as a good listen on its own right.<br/><br/>But that's not why I love the movie. I love it because of its world. Some would say that you have to separate the technical accomplishments from those of the film. But as an 'atmosphere and tone' guy, I say that's impossible. That would be like asking someone to go to Costa Rica but only to do activities, not to check out the scenery.<br/><br/>Simply preposterous. And the film is impressive sight. I do believe that I've never seen a live-action film that managed to wow me as much as this one did. Anyone who doesn't think this film looks good doesn't believe that the best CGI is not only supposed to mimic reality, but to fundamentally enhance it. I do. This is also why I love the Hobbit movies more than you, though they are not on this list.<br/><br/>Not including this film on this list would be like not including the moon landing on a list of the top 100 moments in the twentieth history. It was such a step forward that to ignore it would be leaving a gaping hole in your layout. And so, while I go back to party under Hometree with the Na'vi and give props to whoever made its language, I will end with two final thoughts.<br/><br/>One: this film should have won in the Oscars over The Hurt Locker. That still hurts, even now.<br/><br/>Two: thank you, haters, for moving onto this film and off one my ten favorite films of all time, Titanic. Just sayin'.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"I can't believe it's only been three months. I don't even remember my previous life.\" A quote that could have easily come from a \"World of Warcraft\" addict is uttered by main character in \"Avatar\" after a session in an alien body he's been tasked to control. This is precisely the level of immersion the audience was expected to get onto watching the latest Cameron's attempt at grandeur.<br/><br/>Just like \"Titanic\" ten years ago, \"Avatar\" is so massive an effort in film-making that it's inevitable to find in it things to love, things to hate and a lot in between. It's also inevitable in this age of heavy marketing to adjust expectations according to hype and evaluate film based on how close it met them.<br/><br/>Marketed as nothing less than ground breaking film revolution, \"Avatar\" most certainly isn't. A lot of movies, most notably \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\", \"Polar Express\" and \"Lord of the Rings\" series, have pioneered and polished ALL the technologies utilized in this feat. And don't even mention the \"3D\" projection; if you're even slightly prone to migraines it's advisable to attend plain old 2D screening. What \"Avatar\" is, is for the time being the technological apex of what can be achieved in film-making. There is hardly a flaw in beautifully created alien world of Pandora and its inhabitants. Stereoscopic projection may have even contributed to the awe inspiring vistas of vast spaces that are all CGI.<br/><br/>Also marketed as a unique, life changing story, \"Avatar\" doesn't even come close. In a nutshell, it's a tale of a handicapped army veteran getting involved in military supported exploration of alien world of an Earthlike moon of Pandora. Pandora has all kinds of wildlife and topping the hierarchy are tribes of humanoids. The vet assumes the identity of an artificially created humanoid, controlling it remotely (hence the \"avatar\"), infiltrates a tribe, falls in love with the place and is soon forced to pick a side in an upcoming conflict between his own kind and \"humanoids\". <br/><br/>The predictability abounds as the story borrows heavily from many sources, such as \"Dances With Wolves\", \"Pocahontas\", \"Matrix\", \"Romeo and Juliette\" etc. It also borrows from contemporary controversy of USA foreign policies and environmentalist issues, painting it strongly left/liberal.<br/><br/>This, however is not the story's problem. In context of Hollywood constantly trying to perfect the formula it peddles ever since the producers took over the industry, one could say \"Avatar\" is an apex in exploiting the same old routine of Good vs. Evil, Industry vs. Nature, Love vs. Betrayal, Music on Queue and Happy Ending. It does move at times but for all the wrong reasons and only thanks to experienced but uninspired direction of Cameron.<br/><br/>The problem with the story is the ambition to deliver a deeply convincing and poignant tale of man's place in nature and a reflection on the ways of western culture. There is enough symbolism and parallelism around to account for that. Themes range from phenomenology to modern politics. However, the ambition very quickly falls back on tried and tested clichés audience is believed to like so much; biasing characters towards pure good or pure evil, vain meanderings about \"spirituality\" that really only go around in circles, conveniently and predictably closing all opened questions towards the ending not leaving anything to ponder about after leaving the theater. One has to wonder about the major opportunity missed only because the characters and their motivations were overly simplified.<br/><br/>I recall that small part of the audience gave into applause after the credits rolled. They either applauded the technological marvel of \"Avatar\" or because the good guys won in the end... or, as I suspected, they felt obliged to recognize the ambition and seriousness that was supposed to grace what is already rather hastily called \"the greatest movie of the decade\". It must be the latter because the applause was rather short and feeble.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Man, how life changes. 5 years ago, in the theater, I really liked the movie. Half a decade later, I catch an FX screening on cable. Darn, did my rating this time around drop. It could be my refined tastes, or the increased abundance of CGI. But this re-watch convinced me that, unless the sequels are amazing, Avatar will be forgotten as CGI technology improves. At least it deserve to be. :/ <br/><br/>Nothing about the plot or character stands out as unique (beyond the setting) or realistic. The themes of prejudice, war, and environmentalism have been done to death. Of course, practically anything can be great with good writing, characters relateable to the human condition. But no. The characters are universally stock and bland. There's the good, native aliens and there's the evil, modern, greedy humans. There's no shades of gray. A film that runs 161 minutes should have more depth than this. Oh, and let's be honest: nobody actually believed the main romantic interest...did they?<br/><br/>Why don't I hate Avatar? Well, because visually, it is a beautiful movie. The CGI is very good and used abundantly. Its practically more of an animated film than \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\". It does a great job at portraying an alien jungle, its inhabitants, and the sci-fi elements. The battle scenes are alright.<br/><br/>I'd only watch it if you're really attracted to its style. As the years go by, there will be more and more movies that can match Avatar's specs. Sooner than later, Avatar will be average and forgettable. Its already surprisingly ignored for the highest-grossing movie of all time. Without its effects, its completely derivative, so I wouldn't recommend it highly.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">As usual, James Cameron delivers a visual and technological tour de force while simultaneously proving that he has zero narrative originality and horribly clichéd story-telling concepts. In a different era, a writer director that put out this leftist propaganda would have been tarred, feathered and run out of town on a rail or perhaps even hung for treason. In our era of hypocrisy, no one even chuckles that a megalomaniac tycoon produces, writes or directs a multi-million dollar movie critical of the very economic conditions which ALLOWED IT TO BE MADE. Lame quasi-native American themes of \"Dances with Wolves\" and \"A Man Called Horse\" are clumsily interspersed with naive callow condemnation of corporate greed and the war on terror. A general nature worship pantheism pervades the shallow and ignorant philosophy shoved down the viewers throats. The bio-luminescent plant life is vaguely reminiscent of \"Lothlorien\" in Lord of the Rings and is very beautiful until you realize that from a biological standpoint it serves no purpose and thus wouldn't exist. Alan Dean Foster's \"Midworld\" is not the least of sci-fi authors who deserve credit or at least mention by Cameron for his \"Pandora\". The portrayal of the military in this film is insulting, naive and maybe treasonable.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"Avatar\" is, for all intents and purposes, hardly on the same level of visual medium as a \"film\". It is, it was, to me, an experience. An experience that I happened to witness in a movie theater (luckily enough in an IMAX 3D theater)...and during this experience I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I got excited, but most of all, I was entertained. Entertained, entertained, entertained.<br/><br/>I knew going into the theater that Avatar would be cliché. I did. And I didn't care one bit. I was too preoccupied with the mind-blowing experience before me to care about how stupid a line was or how well I could predict the plot. With Avatar, it really doesn't matter. And to say this film would be nothing without its effects is like saying orange juice would be nothing without the orange. In other words, the effects cannot be separated from the film, NOT BECAUSE the effects make the film, but because story and effects go hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in a way that is not only appealing to the eye, but for the most part, the hearts of the mass audience.<br/><br/>In a way, Avatar's plot not being the most original thing in the world was a good thing. Suppose it did have some wonderfully complex story - would I have enjoyed it as much? Probably not. It doesn't make Cameron lazy for not using original ideas...I mean, Pandora itself is pretty original for film-making (name a movie where a world has literally been created). This is the man who dreamed up the idea for Terminator, we know he has original plot ideas, he didn't need to prove that to us with Avatar.<br/><br/>Avatar is probably the greatest film experience, ever.</div>,\n",

Then the blue things came on, and I tried, but I soon realized that these effects were the film's big attractions. No, I couldn't watch much more.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is a rare movie. Not only is it a stunning example of CGI, excellent writing, and acting that truly brings characters alive, Avatar is a movie that has a story worth telling. Today we are surrounding with movies, especially science fiction, of repeated stories of alien invasions, war, battles, etc., Rare is the movie that has all of these but actually has a story with telling within the CGI and visuals. Avatar is that movie.<br/><br/>The year is 2154 and humanity has begun colonizing other worlds. Pandora is a world rich with resources and former marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is chosen to replace his brother on a mission that would hopefully change humanity's role on the world. Crippled though not defeated in spirit, Jake is willing to do anything that could get him back the ability to use his legs and the Avatar program may be just that and perhaps something more.<br/><br/>His arrival to Pandora opens up a world that is beyond imagination. Working with Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), who makes her disdain towards Jake openly, Jake is thrown into the Avatar program where he mentally takes the form of one of the Na'vi who are the native people of Pandora. At first seeing his mission as a marine would, Jake has no problem gathering intelligence for Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) who leads the military contractor wing that provides security for the mining operations on Pandora.<br/><br/>Jake realizes that there is something more to Pandora and the Na'vi once he befriends Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). He becomes accepted by her tribe slowly once he begins a series of rituals that teach him not only how to understand the Na'vi, but to become one. Jake one day realizes that he is torn between his loyalty to his own race and marine identity and his new found people, and love, for Pandora. The battle that comes is one that will not only decide if Pandora will survive, but also if Jake will remain the man he once was. Pandora, a world of beauty and innocence, is facing its greatest challenge and Jake becomes the only man, and Na'vi, able to save it.<br/><br/>There is a spiritual theme that runs through Pandora. The idea of environmentalism and new age thought runs through the Avatar but not in a way that is forced or condescending. Unlike other movies that preach a message, Avatar lets the idea of defending what is pure run freely and it is this that makes James Cameron's writing one of the best this year. No matter your religious beliefs, there is a spiritual message that is in Avatar and one can compare the corruption that humanity brings to Pandora much as sin did to the Garden of Eden. There are those who will not like this but that is okay. Even if you don't enjoy the ideology behind Avatar, the movie is still one of the best this year. James Cameron deserves best credit for what is one of the most original movies ever made.<br/><br/>10/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is a 3D benchmark program married to an early script of Pochahontas. It's a Walt Disney movie and the way it is colorful and fun only underlines the fact how lucrative it is designed to be. The story is about war and extinction, stuff like that is not colorful and fun. Yes, it is a wonder of computer technology, but technological wonders happen every day, just look at your 50 gigs pendrive smaller then your thumbnail, since when do we credit that as art? I do not find avatar a particularly bad movie, but as a general piece of filmmaking it is not worth more praise than a worse Disney vehicle and the way it now forces cinema to convert to a 3D entertainment park is not something I regard as a benefit to the world.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">After hearing about this movie for almost 7 years, I've finally watched this and think its awesome. It has great visual effects, a fine cast and an amazing soundtrack. I also like this movie better then Titanic. I mean it has some sad scenes in it, but is much more powerful then Titanic. Its also sort of like the animated film Ferngully the Last Rain-forest, but with more action. It also does have an environmental message that we need to protect all the rain- forests. I think the best scene in this movie was the battle sequence between both the Earthlings and the Na'vi and the hero Jake Sully against the villain Colonel Miles Quaritch. I also like the flying sequences in the movie when Jake and Neytiri were flying those bird like creatures all over Pandora. In the end after the great big battle between the humans and Na'vi, most humans were exiled from Pandora back to Earth never to return. Some however were allowed to stay cause they respected Pandora's environment. Jake also became a member of the Na'vi society and all's well that ends well. Awesome movie here and I so recommend this to other people who have not seen it. It also reminds me of Star Wars a little and I don't care what James Cameron thinks of The Force Awakens cause that's still my most favorite movie of all time.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Visually engaging and beautiful. A cast that does a good job on every account. A movie easy to digest. Perhaps too easy? A bit of a too familiar storyline. A fairytale narrative, that has been used countless times by Hollywood before. But the movie flows very well and is conducted without any major flaws. And the sci-fi aspects, are interesting enough to at least give a bit of a unique concept for the story to take place within and even gives room for some deeper philosophical thoughts about life, to a degree. This movie is like a fantasy dream, and I mean that in a good way. And with strong characters that fights for what they believe is right for them, which is a good message for anyone to take in. Even if the movie is predictable and follows a safe path it manage to be engaging and sometimes emotionally gripping even. It achives very well at what its meant to do. And it's a VFX masterpiece. Even if nothing will really surprise you in the story, it will still engage you and entertain you. And even if almost nothing in this movie is real, it still feels real. It's a vision of heart and spirit.<br/><br/>That some really loves this movie and sees it as one of the best movies of all time, is something very understandable.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Well, I'm going to have to give this movie a full rating because it really lived up to my expectations.<br/><br/>We have here a science-fiction epic set on an alien world. It's a classic story of a \"good-guy\" hero who must overcome a battle within himself to do what is right.<br/><br/>Although the movie doesn't exactly have the biggest twists, turns, or surprises, it simply sets out to do what movies like \"Star Wars\" (the ones in the 70s, and 80s, that is) did... to stun us a little with the latest in special FX, give us a classic \"Romanesque\" story, and enchant us with a very creative world. This movie did what it set out to do, perfectly... and maybe even a little better than perfect.<br/><br/>The world is so detailed, and rich. Every animal looks as if it is real... and everything just matches and seems convincing. The \"humanoid\" race that inhabits this world is very interesting, and the way the world works \"together\" is amazing. This may be one of the few sci-fi adventure movies where the computer animation actually works in favor of the storyline. Animals and beings do not look like animations. This realism, this pushing of the limits, is what science fiction is all about.<br/><br/>But you obviously cannot have just a beautiful movie without no storyline or character to back it up. There is a lot of character in this movie. All of our human characters, the alien race, and the avatars all equally have great character. And the storyline, although nothing extraordinarily original, is chiseled from \"classic\" storytelling. Good versus evil... doing what is right... all spun neatly together.<br/><br/>What a wonderful escape this was! It was dazzling, and even got me thinking a little about what life is really out there on the various billions of stars that make up our galaxy, and the other billions of galaxies out there.<br/><br/>And that's what movies like this should do.</div>,\n",

This masterful slice of storytelling tracks the explosive action on the planet Pandora.<br/><br/>A paraplegic marine is sent in to learn the ways of the local creatures on the planet. For this mission a team of scientists create a genetic being intimately linked to his human form. This Avatar can eat, breathe, sleep and adapt to the harsh conditions on Pandora. <br/><br/>But Jake Sully doesn't anticipate what is about to follow and neither does Neytiri - his love interest - of the Na'vi clan.<br/><br/>For the humans, it's about stopping at nothing in their quest to mine the rich minerals on Pandora. But this is a sacred world where the creatures are at one with one another and God. <br/><br/>With Cameron's direction the heroes of this story take the viewer on a ride of a lifetime in arguably the greatest special effects film of all time. This is true movie genius and Cameron deserves all the praise that is being heaped on him.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">If you like heavy-handed metaphors, laughable dialogue, and predictable plots, you'll love \"Avatar,\" auteur James Cameron's latest creation.<br/><br/>Technically, \"Avatar\" is a blend of Cameron's past efforts. Like \"The Abyss,\" it taps into the supernatural qualities of nature. Like \"T2,\" it captures humanoids visually using innovative special effects. Like \"Titanic,\" it juxtaposes a Romeo/Juliet-type romance with chaos and destruction. Unfortunately, while those three films are great, \"Avatar\" is not.<br/><br/>James Cameron has never shied away from foreshadowing. Every one of his films builds suspense through eerie happenings, musical cues, and suspicious dialogue early on. \"Avatar\" takes foreshadowing to a new level. Early on, characters literally say what is going to happen for the rest of the film. You could easily outline the entire plot about twenty minutes into the movie. Obvious parallels are drawn early on between the Na'vi (the blue humanoids) and the Native Americans, with the greedy white invaders standing in for....well....greedy white invaders. Then you get the obligatory environmentalists, as well as the morally conflicted protagonist. The plot proceeds as you would imagine. I won't spoil it, but as I said, it basically spoils itself. In fact, it bears a lot in common with Disney's \"Atlantis,\" a much better film.<br/><br/>Even with a hackneyed plot, one would expect that the great James Cameron could weave a great film through effects, actors, and plot tweaking. The plot rarely wavers from that which is expected. While plot twists are obnoxious in most cases nowadays, one or two would've been welcome here- so long as they weren't outlandish.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it's not bad. Sam Worthington's Australian accent seems out of place, but he puts in solid work as the subdued paraplegic protagonist. He struggles with the daily video diary entry scenes, but these are simply plot devices on Cameron's part to inject narration. Some of the supporting players are real stand-outs. Giovanni Ribisi provides comic relief as the mostly apathetic corporate representative on board. His character serves no purpose other than to provide laughs, but he manages to steal a few scenes with his dead-pan delivery. Sigourney Weaver is very good as the ship's leading scientist. She molds a complex-seeming character out of one that was surely flat on paper. The cast's best performance comes from Stephen Lang as the grisled colonel. The character is a cliché, but Lang allows the audience to relate to his perspective.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is very pretty. The world certainly looks real, the blue people move about smoothly, and the battle scenes look convincing. What's lacking is visual flourish. The Na'vi look off-putting and somewhat stupid, and their strange screaming does nothing to dispel this. The creatures on which they fly look like something straight out of \"Star Wars Episode III,\" and the same could be said of the lush tree-centered environment. The choreography of the battle scenes is also mostly weak. It doesn't raise adrenaline so much as it numbs the viewer.<br/><br/>On the whole, \"Avatar\" is derivative plot-wise and lacking in style and novelty visually. However, some solid performances and a few visual master-strokes make it an average movie, rather than a bad one.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This movie has seriously made an impact on me and I never expected it to. The first thing I noticed, the first thing I think anybody who has watched this movie noticed, was how realistic the CGI was. The first time I saw an Avatar in the tank, I couldn't believe how real it looked. It was just simply amazing. But when he travelled to Pandora in the Avatar, the scenery was something out of this world, it was like something I've never seen before. Totally outstanding and brilliant and beautiful and colourful, it's worth to see it just for that. The Na'Vi looked so realistic that you'd forget they weren't.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie were quite simply brilliant. Granted that they somewhat reminded you of characters in past movies but there wasn't a character I hated and the emotion was there all the way through the movie so it worked like a charm. You actually cared about the characters you were supposed to care about and you hated the characters you were supposed to hate. I couldn't find a fault with the acting, the cast were chosen correctly. The story is brilliant though it has been done before through other movies but this worked phenomenally. James Cameron gives out such a powerful message from the movie. We, as the human race, are so obsessed with money and power and unimportant materialistic things that we truly forget some of the important things to live by such as love, pride and faith which he portrayed through the Na'Vi and I think that's a beautiful message and I hope many people can see that.<br/><br/>The 3D effects in the movie was truly amazing and seeing this movie in 3D or \"real D\" was one of the best experiences. Truly mesmerising, I truly advise and urge anyone and everyone out there to see this movie in 3D otherwise you will seriously regret it! I have seen this in 2D and 3D and I've instantly fell in love with it. Visually gorgeous to the eyes, characters built to amaze and the story brilliantly told, this is easily one of the best movies of the decade!

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">There is a definite downside to overhyping. It doesn't matter how good the movie is, if its being touted as the next coming of Christ, anything short of that will be met by with rage from the fanboys. After the first trailer, Avatar seemed to be clearly heading into this territory. A seemingly predictable plot, strange looking blue people and a bunch of unknowns boded poorly for the movies success. I myself was unassured, but knew it had to be seen anyways. I'm glad I did, because Avatar is the best blockbuster experience of the year, although not without its faults.<br/><br/>Avatar skips through the opening pretty quickly, starting off with paraplegic ex-marine Jake Sully (Worthington) awakening after a six year journey to the new world Pandora. Pandora is littered with various dangerous creatures, spirit dandelions and a valuable rock known as Unobtanium, but most importantly for our purposes the hyper-spiritual humanoid race known as the Na'vi. Unfortunately, the Na'vi have settled right on top of the richest Unobtanium reserve on the planet. Industrialist Parker Selfridge (Ribisi, with the least subtle character name ever) wants them off, and ex-Marine mercenary Quatrich (Lang) is more than willing to blow them to hell to get them to move. The science team, led by Dr. Grace Augustine (Weaver) is more interested in studying the Na'vi and their connections to the Earth, and want a diplomatic solution to the mining issue. When Sully's brother on the science team is murdered, he is brought in due to his genetic structure being compatible with his brother's avatar, a Na'vi-human crossbreed body that can be controlled remotely.<br/><br/>Sully's job to infiltrate the Na'vi becomes more complicated when he begins to fall for their culture, their spirituality and Neytiri (Saldana), a warrior princess. The core plot itself unfolds very predictably, and from the trailers alone the basic structure is given completely. The plot moves along at a brisk enough pace though that, even if its coloured within the lines, its a fun journey to take.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the movie is the lack of subtlety in the spirituality of the film. The deity Ewya that the Na'vi believe in is invoked far too much, oftentimes unnecessarily. It gives the movie a bit too much of a tree-huggy nature to it at times, and could have been done without.<br/><br/>The plot is clearly meant to parallel Iraq, and as such many of the humans are portrayed as boneheaded violence monkeys (guess which side thats supposed to be). There are a couple characters to offset this thankfully, but enough need to be still violence monkeys to allow for the climactic battle, which is like a ramped up version of the Ewok fight in Return of the Jedi. Its an amazing action setpiece, and if thats the sole reason you wish to see the movie, it will not disappoint.<br/><br/>The effects were one of the most hyped up aspects of the movie, and they do not disappoint at all. The computer effects are some of the best ever seen on screen, and succeed in creating an entire new world. The Na'vi people themselves manage to avoid the \"uncanny valley\" effect and are entirely believable, rarely seeming robotic or, well, computerized. The environment is completely believable, but not that far above what one sees in modern video games. Some of the landmarks, such as the floating mountains, are a bit excessive. Sci-fi can explain away many things, but gravity should still make the mountains rest on the ground. And what the hell is a flux vortex or whatever, aren't we above making up sci-fi gibberish? The 3D effect is very well done. The only time I'd seen it done well before was in Up, where it was subtle to the point of almost being unnoticeable. In this case, it is noticeable, but never distracts from whats important. There are no pop-out moments to draw attention to it, but the effect works wonders to immerse the viewer in the movie.<br/><br/>Cameron wisely stuck away from A-listers, with B-list recognizable faces mixed with complete unknowns. Sigourney Weaver is by far the biggest star in her movie, but is believable enough in her determination (a very similar performance to her own in Gorillas in the Mist) to not let this get in the way. Worthington, a complete unknown before production on Avatar started, is an excellent lead and can possibly become the next big action star. Saldana brings a very elegant flow to Neytiri, and Ribisi is an excellent pigheaded moneyman.<br/><br/>The true standout in my opinion is Lang as former Colenol Quatrich, the badass mercenary who warns of the low gravity making the marines \"soft\". Lang, who showed his funny side with a memorable role in The Men Who Stare at Goats, now portrays one of the most convincing and frighteningly badass villains in film. Its one hell of an entertaining performance, and here's hoping creates many an internet fad.<br/><br/>Avatar is an excellent blockbuster, but the predictibility of the story perhaps makes it slightly less than the heights the fanboys had hoped. Still, its an amazingly entertaining movie, and a must-see experience. Just try not to get over-hyped.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">During the first half of the film we are introduced into the marvelous and alien world of Pandora. Special effects are top flight and oonceptual science fiction elements are tightly woven.<br/><br/>Alas this marvelous setting is squandered on some kind of wacky morality play in which evil humans driven by overbearing caricatures of the military and corporate worlds act like monsters to destroy the hippie wonderland.<br/><br/>The whole second half is boring and rather predictable, although I'll admit I never thought it could plunge to this level of crude self=satire. By the end I was reminded of Sigourney Weaver's plan to \"nuke the place from orbit\", just to rid of these ridiculous stereotypic Natives being saved by the Great White Hunter and his renegade sidekicks.<br/><br/>There is no subtlety at all in the second half morality play. We are being force fed a phony morality until it is reborn in a massive episode of projectile vomitus of hovercraft brought down by pterodactyls. Enough. The beautiful people with their private jets and hundred million dollar self aggrandizing lectures don't expect to have to live in the jungle. They expect us to live their, in obeisance to their Angry God of Carbon.<br/><br/>Way to ruin what could have been a very good movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Nearly two decades in the making, $300 millions spend and apt promises it will revolutionize cinema as we know it, Avatar reclaims James Cameron as the most visionary director of our generation. The movie can be described as an amazing 3D experience that uses the sci-fi plot as a platform to present its unique style. Avatar is just that spectacular blending Cameron's inherent ease in telling the story with the use of new astonishing technology on full display. The pro-environmental message of the movie may not be original (among others it was superbly explored in Hayao Miyazaki's epic, Castle In The Sky), yet it doesn't even matter since the movie is so powerfully conducted and ingeniously conceived. Cameron has created the new civilization that is equally potent and galvanizing. With their distinct characteristics and language, Navis feel totally authentic. The computer generated backgrounds are just pleasure to behold with the high level of detail and highly exotic feel. Avatar also wouldn't be the same movie without its tour-de-force action sequences that raise the bar ridiculously high. Nonetheless, I still felt emotionally involved due to a surprisingly moving performance by Zoe Saldana. This kind of emotions cannot be generated with computer. She even overshadows Sam Worthington who happens to be very reliable in the leading role. Overall, Avatar is one hell of a ride worth taking again and again. It has never been more apparent than now that Cameron is the king of the world. 10/10 (A)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Usually it happens, with films that introduce some technical innovation, that the fascination only lasts for as long as the next technical innovation appears. In Avatar, it doesn't even last that long. Once your eyes get used to the crispy images and colours, you realize that this is really only a cartoon on high-definition.<br/><br/>So on to the film. This is pretty much the Conquistadores versus the American-natives allover again.<br/><br/>So on to whatever ideas are to be found here.<br/><br/>I am willing to indulge the whole philosophy that nature acts as some sort of network and that we should interact harmoniously with it. It's just that the whole idea is leaking in the sense that in a nature that works in a Darwinian framework, it doesn't make much difference if the hunter respects the prey, or if a species is becoming extinct due to extraneous factors. Nature is chaos and you can find all sorts of excuses to justify chaos, or learn to live with it. But it's still chaos, and chaos has no sentiment.<br/><br/>The last part of the film is \"Rambo\" and \"Aliens\" allover again, and to be honest, no matter how advanced the computer graphics are, this is less impressive than Cameron's past adventures.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">After over a decade since the film 'Titanic' became the highest grossing film of all time and placed itself in-between Ben-Hur &amp; Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King for the most academy awards ever won by a single film, James Cameron returns to bring the audience 'AVATAR' a film rumoured to be more expensive than any other film (if so it would be the third time Cameron has broken the record) and is claimed to be a revolution in 3-D technology and visual effects. And after all the hype and media attention Cameron has given us a brilliant film, well told and brilliantly crafted. Cameron's direction is perfect and confident, after allowing the likes of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich to try and direct large action films he returns to show them how a master does it. The acting is superb and supported by the incredible visual effects, Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver's performances all shine through the blue creatures known as the Na'vi. The visual effects are incredible and if Avatar - likely to see a best picture nomination as well - does not sweep the technical categories it will be a joke on the Oscars, worse than the Golden Compass winning visual effects over Transformers. James Horner's third collaboration with Cameron as a composer is once again a triumph and while I still prefer the Titanic soundtrack, his music is a perfect blend of Aliens, Titanic and original music that you have never heard before. The pacing is wonderful and nothing short of an epic and if I had a problem it was only with the dialogue. I would prefer if James Cameron wrote the screen story but co-wrote the screenplay with someone else. The film is certainly a milestone and should definitely be seen.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I had hoped with all the hype, this flick would be something other than a rip off for light minded teens and kids.<br/><br/>I saw almost immediately plagiarism from Aliens Two. The dark glasses, the Marines, ah, sucks.. how did this guy get paid for copying this film script.<br/><br/>Yes, the special video effects are enticing and actually charming, but a movie this alone does not make.<br/><br/>One contributor of like minded view said the film writer took all of three weeks to write this copy cat work.<br/><br/>Only a two from me.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the distance future, the human race have discovered a unique planet, Pandora, in which a humanoid alien species, the Na'vi, exists. A highly valuable natural resource can be harvested from Pandora, and great lengths are taken to gain some control of the planet. Jake Sully, a paraplegic war veteran, is offered the chance to take part in a mission to help communication links between humans and the Na'vi by using an 'Avatar' which resemble the Na'vi in appearance. This involves him accidentally getting into the position of getting to know the Na'vi as well as possible in order to eventually persuade them to allow the humans to extract Pandora's valuable natural resource<br/><br/>There is an obvious colonialist subtext which clings to the narrative of Avatar from the film's opening minutes and this is quite possibly the most rich the narrative ever becomes with little else to provide much depth to the films essence. The story for Avatar is interesting but it is far too cluttered with linear directions on how the film should flow from one scene to the next that by the credits it feels like Avatar has accomplished very little. This is mainly due to the lack of insight provided into the world of Pandora and even the nuances of the Na'vi themselves. Both are explored purely on a foreign viewpoint and it can be argued that this works in conjunction with the world being presented by the human character of Jake, but even when he begins to fuse his being with that of the Na'vi, not much more is presented to the viewer. There is a lot going for the film but it is disappointing that more is not made of it. Another problem lies with the Na'vi themselves. Their language, voices, dress code and cultural mannerism lack any distinct criteria beyond metaphorical elaboration. The Na'vi are, simply put, a mere fantasy retelling of the indigenous tribes of Africa or even American Indians. While this does help the colonialist theme of the film and in making the narrative appear more real, it nevertheless makes the story less unique and only disregards any originality the Na'vi could have as a species. It does not come as a surprise then that the human protagonists are mainly Caucasian and the Na'vi counterparts are African or Native American.<br/><br/>Acting is a slightly better department but the actors don't have much to work with as characters fall into defined stereotypes and the odd lines of dialogue lack consistency. Giovanni Ribisi is one of the more spirited actors but he plays a conventional power hungry executive: he becomes representative of the two-dimensional nature of the villains. Caricatures do not stop there but they are less identifiable in the heroes of the story. Worthington provides a more delicate approach to his character showing a clear distinctness in tone between his human and Na'vi selves. This does become questionable at times when even at times of unease his human self appears somewhat lackluster. Zoe Saldana is a pleasure to watch, even though she is a Na'vi, and this is purely because she is more in tune with her character than any other actor. At the end of the day, character development is on the weak side, with one character seemingly deciding to make certain decisions even when little evidence was provided for the character to do so. This also goes as far as character relationships being glazed over, even by the last third of the film where characters seem closer than originally expected.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint the musical score and computer generated imagery work wonders. The music definitely adds to the emotion and feel of the film heightening the more sad and courageous moments while also aiding in scene transition. The computer imagery is staggering in scope encompassing an entire environment. There is the odd scene where textures lose their realistic look but it is in the quality of the animation of characters, creatures and flora where Avatar shines.<br/><br/>While sex is implied, there is no nudity beyond the Na'vi wearing little in terms of clothing. Language consists of mild profanities and the odd blasphemous term, while violence ranges from a variety of gunfire and stabbings among others; violence is never gory with minimal blood visible, though some acts can be a little extreme.<br/><br/>Avatar is an ambitious film and it deserves to be so with the majestic landscape of Pandora, and her inhabitants, nearly being adequate substitutes for reality. With the well conceived musical score, Avatar has the technical factors nailed but it all falls apart when the film's core narrative is added to the mix. For all the possibilities available, the film forgoes depth for simplicity and convention. If anything, Avatar is an enjoyable film but an enjoyable film with substance that does not equate to its hype.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The premise of the film is that a man, the protagonist of the film was a paraplegic ex marine, sent to an alien moon. Now you have to accept this premise, that it's possible to mix the DNA of this human with the natives of this orb, and to create the physical appearance of the indigenous 12 foot tall human like creatures, but with characteristics of the human. And then the human can be placed in a device where he provides the thought process of his navi avatar.<br/><br/>It worked for me.<br/><br/>Now my reader I ask you to remember the first time you discovered the wonders of our world, the first time a butterfly landed on your shoulder, or you chased fireflies, or came across a stunning natural vista. Our lives are a series of discoveries such as these, but they get to be fewer as the years go by.<br/><br/>I made this connection, that I, that we, are all avatars in a way. But we are not from a different world but from something else, from all that shaped us over the eons. I am not a spiritual person, in fact I'm what could be referred to as a radical rationalist. But, the organism that I'm so attached to, this self, this person who was born 70 years ago with only a relatively short time to go, is so much more than this short span of my life.<br/><br/>I'm an avatar, not from a different planet, but from all that came before me with DNA, some of it still functional, from primal organisms that lived billions of years ago. It's all unfolds in this organism, all the drives, all the urges, all the love and all the hate. At times it seems alien...because it is. I fear heights because I can't fly, and deep water because I have no gills, and snakes because those who survived had this fear and those who didn't never quite made it.<br/><br/>And probably, with all the fears and urges, all the passions that are part of us, there is something else. There is a capacity for the pleasure of being a part of something beyond ourselves. Certainly sex is a drive that has to be overwhelming, or we would have ignored it when we were under stress....which we usually were. But other pleasures..... being part of a group, a tribe, a country..... participating in a communal sing, a ceremony of belonging..... the joy in a moment of peace when all seems right with the world.<br/><br/>The word for this film, for me is found in this meaning of \"epiphany\"</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This movie was hyped. A lot. More than probably any other movie in history. This hype eventually piled up so high that the film itself could never catch up. But, shockingly enough, it came damned close to doing just that. Like Star Wars and The Matrix before it, this film marked the beginning of a new generation of visual effects, and like those films, delivers enough in other areas to leave an impression that was more than just skin deep. Despite this movie's singular flaw (the script), this cinematic titan delivered more than enough thrills to compensate for James Cameron's occasionally iffy writing.<br/><br/>It also does something that no other film has managed to do before: it truly makes you feel like you are there, in its world, and you find yourself filled with a genuine sense of wonder as you try to take in Pandora's rich flora and fauna. The quality of the special effects has been discussed to death already, but this is the factor that anchors the film, the aspect of it that was the main source of the astronomical anticipation (other than the name \"James Cameron\"). However, if visual splendor serves as this movie's anchor, then the ship is built mainly from two materials: story and acting. The story (or, more accurately, stories), though they have been told countless times before, seem to never fail to leave a mark on audiences, and the resonance of one in particular is felt almost too strongly today. The clash of science, commerce, and militarism make for some great scenes of dialogue and tension, and add a philosophical aspect to the film, especially taking the constant contrast between the human Pandora and Na'vi Pandora into account.<br/><br/>Of course, the world of Pandora wouldn't be at all believable without characters populating it, and the actors fit their respective roles like gloves. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana work incredibly well together onscreen, and truly bring their roles to life with some of the most underappreciated performances of 2009. One final part of the movie that I feel was the most unappreciated is the soundtrack. James Horner's best yet, it combines most of the best aspects of modern orchestral scores with those of traditional tribal melodies to match the setting of Pandora, and as a result is some of the most purely beautiful music anyone who cares to download the soundtrack will ever hear. Though you only leave Pandora just under 3 hours after you arrive, Pandora will not leave you for a considerably longer period of time. While it may not have been the best film of 2009 in terms of raw quality, its emotional impact, outstanding direction, and truly spectacular eye candy easily make it one of the most entertaining.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Last time I saw it was the first time of its release. And I must say, I may not remember every detail that much, but boy do I remember this film. It will forever be burnt in my brain the things this film created, influenced, achieved, and so much more. I've noticed a lot of trolls on here and other sources bashing this film ever since the Marvel Cinematic Universe spectacle of eye candy Avengers: Endgame, which I did love dearly and considered one of the greatest movies in that year and of 2019s generation. But it has been over 10 years since Avatar and I feel like a lot of people forget the legacy this film left. It didn't need over 20 films to reach the nearly 3 billion dollar mark. Success is success regardless of how it was achieved, but Avatar did so much and achieved a whole lot with just one movie alone. I really would like to watch this film again. But watching it in 2009 for the first and only time I made an oath to myself to never watch it again... but not in a bad way, because I will only watch it unless it is released in theaters again. It's a \"cinematic\" spectacle of eyecandy. That's the film it's supposed to be. Script is great, acting is great, and sure you can bash the film here and there on plot and some things that can be predictable, but I'm sorry for all the people who hate this film, but you clearly don't understand the impact and importance this film had and still has. I most certainly cannot wait for part 2 all the way through 5, and I'm more than certain James Cameron has way much more to offer than we the audience think.<br/><br/>In conclusion, guys look, Avatar is the biggest chapter point of the late 2000s, coming out in 2009 after 2008s biggest and one of the best movies ever the Dark Knight, no one thought anything could compete, not saying Avatar is a better movie folks, I will take the Dark Knight over a lot of films and honestly it is in my top 10 films ever. What I am saying is the significance of film and transcending the genre on a insane spectacle is something that Avatar manages to do with the insane effects that have been worked on and to this day looks way better than almost any movie that comes out. Avatar is a 10/10 for me and for many people because of this. It's not supposed to have the most groundbreaking dialogue EVER and etc etc etc. but that does not mean it doesn't have any, it's a solid story overall solid film behind the spectacle of AMAZING EFFECTS BEYOND COMPARISON. let me put it this way folks... believe it or not there's a lot of people complain about the simple plot of Jurassic Park and look at it as \"outdated\" but what they fail to understand is the movie isn't supposed to be any type of level of citizen Kane, casablanca, it has very solid performances but the effects are magnificent... do you understand now??? Ok let's give more examples... Steven Spielberg's Jaws In 1975 transcended a genre with amazing effects of a shark that was deemed nearly impossible the effects changed the entire game, even though the plot wasn't the BIGGEST groundbreaking and some dialogue can be nit picked... still no?? Ok, how about let's go to the 80s when James Cameron does it again and creates one of the greatest action movie ever Terminator 2: Judgement Day?? Why is it one of the greatest?? Because of its feats of effects, and I can't deny the performance and script etc was amazing hands down but the effects and the idea transcended action movies to a different level... then 90s Spielberg does it again with Jurassic Park... and then 2000s is Avatar... and I'm sure we can all agree that avengers endgame is 2010s through 2019s movie that changed the game you get my drift folks???? I'm telling you... years and years down the line Avatar will be looked at and it might not be \"the best film\" but folks it certainly does not hold it back in anyway shape or form for the legacy James Cameron created yet again.<br/><br/>The point I'm making is there's always at least one amazing film that transcends a genre with awe in effects to different heights and certainly needs to at least be a solid movie to deserve the praise. A lot of people argue endgame wasn't as good as infinity war, some argue endgame wasn't good at all and was bad... but they can't deny what it achieved, on Avatars behalf it will always be remembered and deserves everything<br/><br/>\n",

It's about a small American boy in South America, kidnapped by an forgotten indigenous tribe, and raised as an Indian. The boy grows up and eventually falls in love with Kachiri, a girl in his clan. All is beauty and serenity, until one day white men invade, and steal the women to turn them into prostitutes, Kachiri included, and then it became a battle of primitives vs. guns. Very similar in terms of general thematics, and how beauty can be found in nature. Of course, there were no soldiers, no heavy artillery and no 3-D, which, by the way, was pretty shallow throughout Avatar's inordinate length, and I would be a whole lot happier if someone would invent contact lens that would work for 3-D instead of those cumbersome glasses. Technically, though, the film in magnificent. And while the story is noticeably predictable, and there was a sense of video gamery afoot, all in all, Avatar is a gorgeous, feel-good movie that is never boring throughout its 162 minutes (though I can't wait for the 10-hour ultimate directors cut :)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Avatar\" is a film directed by James Cameron about an ex-marine, Jake Sulley, who has become part of a project known as the Avatar Program. The Avatar Program is a system where humans can walk through Pandora, which is the home of a race of people known as the Na'vi, as one of the people, and when I say one of the people, I mean your essence in the body of a Na'vi. These are known as avatars. What we learn from Jake is that he was injured in combat, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. He also had a twin brother who was part of the Avatar Program, but he was killed in action. After being called in, he is given a mission: make contact with the Na'vi, and make them trust him, this way the soldiers and the businessmen can obtain a mineral. During his experience on Pandora, he meets Neytiri, a woman from the Na'vi tribe, and daughter to the leader. As Jake begins to learn about the Na'vi and their beliefs, he begins to have a change in view about everything, and his heart grows fonder of Neytiri. And I am going to stop right there because I do not want to give too much away for those who have not seen it. PROS: The visuals were superb. Seeing it in IMAX 3D gave it something that would not be appreciated if you saw it in 2D in a regular theater. The development of the Na'vi was really well done. I could tell that Cameron had a huge appreciation for the Na'vi. You felt their pain, you really did. The music was also fantastic. James Horner, who scored movies like \"Legends of the Fall\", \"An American Tail\", \"The Land Before Time\", and \"Titanic, which he won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. I felt that the score is part of what made the film, and the music was one of the reasons why I wanted to see \"Avatar\" in the first place. Zoe Saldana carries a pitch perfect performance as Neytiri. I have liked her since Gore Verbinski's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" and Steven Spielberg's \"The Terminal\". But it was \"Avatar\" that brought out the best in her. She added depth to the character that Cameron could not, which says a lot about her. CONS: The story was incredibly clichéd. Even though there were differences, it was, as someone else has said, \"Pocahontas\" in space. Also, the dialog was bad in certain areas. I laughed a little when I know I should not have laughed. However, Cameron also made \"Titanic\", which had laughable moments in the film, mostly involving Jack and Rose. Furthermore, the characters were one-dimensional. You did not care about them at all. It was your basic James Cameron story: There are good guys, and there are bad guys...and then there is everyone else. That is it. I have always been partial to movies that present 3- dimensional human beings. John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" comes to mind, where the only villain in the whole film was the monster. You would think that James Cameron would take advantage of making 3-dimensional characters in a film that is meant to be seen in 3D. Jake Sulley, which is moderately portrayed by Sam Worthington, had poor character development. I sat through basically the whole movie thinking, \"Why should I care?\" even though I did not want him to die, there was still that part of me that had no emotional stake in the outcome as far as Jake was concerned. James Cameron has always had, I think, a poor ability to create good characters and get the audience involved. He is great at making innovations in film, sure, but that can easily be removed. To me, the great filmmakers of the world get you involved on an emotional level with the film. Steven Spielberg does that in just about every film that he has ever made; Peter Jackson has been doing it ever since he made \"The Lord of the Rings\". The list can go on and on, but Cameron does not fit. All in all, \"Avatar\" is a movie that I probably will not see again, because there is no point for me to see it. If I had no connection with the characters, and if I did not care for the story, then there is no point in seeing it twice, unless I am going to make fun of it and ridicule it in a playful manner. Did it deserve its Oscars that it won? Yes, with visual effects being a given. But was it worthy of a Best Director and Best Picture nomination? Probably not.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The special effects are overwhelming and may cloud most people's judgment as to whether this is a worthwhile film or not. Let us eliminate that factor first and examine the story first because it is important.<br/><br/>The story is really a poorly disguised analogy of a story that has oft been repeated time and again throughout human history. Will we ever learn? One race, species, or form of life wants something that happens to be at a place that another race, species, or form of life is already occupying. The solution? Move the indigenous civilization! If they won't go willingly then they will be forced. In today's world it is called eminent domain. To put a perspective on this it is easy to draw a parallel between the indigenous Na'vi of this film and Native Americans even down to a horse-like creature that they ride and their weapon of choice: bows and arrows. Once again Western civilization encroaches in the form of Earthlings. In the film Earth is apparently a dying world because of the very problem that we are now bringing to the Na'vi world, Pandora. We want the resources that just happen to exist underneath the most sacred real estate for a Na'vi forest clan. To draw another parallel we are essentially destroying the forest much like we are doing today to our own Amazon rain forest in order to mine the Hell out of it. If the natives, animals, or anything gets in the way that's just too bad. There is really very little sympathy for the dying Earth's plight here and most likely this is justifiably so. Since the viewer will readily identify with the human side of things in this story there is very little need to do a lot of character building or motive explanation.<br/><br/>Most of the story attempts to convey the Na'vi point of view and their way of life. Attempts to be diplomatic and woo the Na'vi have failed because the Na'vi really don't need or want anything the Earthlings have to offer. These are some very seriously spiritually grounded people and the viewer will find themselves wishing to be like them and feel sorrow that we as a race have veered away from the things that ultimately matter. The Na'vi world is very beautiful and respectful of all living energy. They have all they need and see no reason to trade it all away for 'lite beer, video games, and Nikes'. So, now you should have the general idea here.<br/><br/>As noted the story is not new but it is handled very well. It is compelling and never boring. Much of this did indeed have to do with the special effects which are nothing short of amazing. I kind of fear that while the movie espouses a non-technological theme it is ironic that the human actors are completely usurped by the CGI actors. Alas, it appears to be the shape of things to come. I also found it a bit askew that while the human race has acquired all of this technology that allows us to spend 6 years in space to get to Pandora in the first place that we have failed to advance spiritually as well nor have we been able to find the natural resources we need without resorting to destroying other planets to get them.<br/><br/>Bottomline: Not a new story but handled very well. Excellent special effects!! This is a movie well worth watching a number of times if only to once again try to feel some of the original commonality and respect for this planet we once shared with the lesser clans of this world.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Certainly loved the dreamy world that James Cameron has beautifully created and masterfully directed!! The art director has done an amazing job; the stunning colors and landscapes will keep your bottom stuck to your seat and your eyes fixed on the screen throughout the almost-three-hour movie. Avatar also has some great performances by Zoe Saldana (she is absolutely sensational as Neytiri!), Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, and Sigourney Weaver.<br/><br/>The movie's sole letdown is the story! A cliché that you've probably seen thousands of times before. The brave white man who curiously discovers- and later becomes part of- a less civilized community, influencing and being influenced by them. The story also ponders on other \"cliched\" themes such as spiritual courage and the identification of man with nature. However, the plot line, as simple and cheesy as it is, is beautifully drawn and, at some parts, will certainly stir the emotions of the audience.<br/><br/>Avatar is one hell of an experience you don't wanna miss!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Im sure this has been said in other reviews but when I watched it the first thing that I thought was Dances with Wolves with aliens<br/><br/>if you want to be manipulated then this is a good movie if you see it for what it is then its pretty boring</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Frankly, I didn't think James Cameron would pull it off, but he did. Avatar turned into a groundbreaking work of art... if you look at the visual side of the movie. If you watch this movie in IMAX 3D – as you should – it will be an unforgettable experience. You have the feeling that you've actually been to the planet of Pandora. You'll really think that an alien race like the Na'vi exist. James Cameron did a great job inventing their language, habits and rituals. He also put a lot of detail into the planet itself. The exotic animals do not all convince, but the trees, plants and insects are stunning. Especially the images of the floating mountains are unforgettable. <br/><br/>But does Avatar also break ground on a story level? No, it doesn't. Like many visitors have concluded before, the movie heavily relies on a flick like Dances with wolves and borrows elements from a game like Assassin's Creed. This scifi tale is pretty predictable actually, but that doesn't hurt in any way. You know the good side will win eventually and you know the hero in the end gets the girl. In order to see that happen you'll be more than willing to sit through the whole 165 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Oh, perhaps there's at least one thing that can be considered groundbreaking storywise. To me this was perhaps the first time that a director/writer succeeded in showing a believable love story between a human and an alien. The chemistry between our human hero and alien heroin didn't have Titanic proportions, but it worked.<br/><br/>At this point (Dec 20th) it is clear that Avatar is a big hit worldwide. I don't know if it will cover its costs but the hype is there. I only wonder if the audience understands the fact that James Cameron used two major American tragedies to achieve the right sentiment for the story. The first one is obviously the tragedy of the Native American people. Like the Na'vi they were slaughtered by the (white) men in the name of greed. In the story of Avatar they win the fight, but as we all know in real life it was different. Is this a case of alternate history? The second tragedy used by Cameron is a powerful one: the collapsing of the World Trade Centre. In Avatar it translates into an impressive and moving scene, but one could wonder if tragedies like these aren't too sacred to be used in entertainment movies like these. Here they're only used for dramatic effect, not for a (political) statement. But maybe I'm just nitpicking here. <br/><br/>Avatar is a impressive and unforgettable movie experience. James Cameron establishes himself as the great moviemaker he is and I cannot think of anyone who can resist his imagining of a this wondrous fantasy world. After 12 years of silence, the success of Titanic behind him and stories of an ever increasing budget, the pressure on James Cameron must have been inhumanly big. But still, the man delivers. <br/><br/>Avatar is not a movie. It's an event!<br/><br/>9/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I see many people rate this one-star. They are contrary for the sake of it. This film may not be your cup of tea, but one star? One star says this film is without worth, worthless. Sorry but that is not Avatar.<br/><br/>Even if you hated the story, the visuals are amazing and would deserve more than one star. When watching it, you forget about the 3D after a while... and actually the 3D isn't the main selling point, it's just the luscious visuals of Pandora that are amazingly brought to life in this movie.<br/><br/>The story itself is quite good, not hugely imaginative, but good enough.<br/><br/>But mostly I just can't believe people would give this one star. This film doesn't deserve it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Just finished watching the 3-d version of this as I wouldn't recommend experiencing Avatar any other way. I'm sure there has been much mentioned in previous reviews about Avatar in its strengths and weaknesses but here is what I got out of it.<br/><br/>As far as appearances go, this movie is great to look at, everything seems immaculate in its detail. Some of the creatures seem very real in some of the close up shots. The character played by Sam Worthington is the protagonist I can root for as the wheel chair bound hero turned Nav'i. The monsters were biologically creative with their telepathically physical qualities. It felt like an adventure ride from start to finish. I especially liked the beginning in the space ship where the troops were floating in space. The story, while rumored to be plagiarizing, seems forgivable, though months behind District 9, and Surrogates (a movie I didn't like too much). There were some implementations.<br/><br/>Aside from the seemingly clichéd story, I had trouble with some of the vast amount of expositions that made the story way too predictable. The writing needed to be tweaked in order to sway from the dangerously predictable clichés in Avatar. Mentioned was a dragon head that only 5 members of the Nav'i tribe was able to conquer and tame throughout history, I found myself thinking: lemme guess, Worthington's character will probably take the saddle of this \"dragon\" later on in the film, and you know what? I was right. Then there was that pointless group-gathering montage, as if the Nav'i from the rest of the planet didn't know that their sacred tree was fallen. I felt that part should have been eliminated too. Then there was that general, while good at his part, seemed like he was all over the place as his character is spread too thin. The general stands watch in the middle of the night, holds meetings, makes strange brainwashed Marine dialog and fights in mech suits. He would have been a better right hand man, not necessarily a colonial or presidential leader. He was over utilized as a universal bad guy which got annoying.<br/><br/>If you think these are major gripes, they are not really. This movie is still \"all sorts of awesome\" and I will be sure to own the DVD when it comes out. I still recommend it, outstanding visuals will make the story forgivable.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">When Kubrick's \"2001: A space Odyssey\" came out in 1968 critics hailed it as a milestone, a trailblazing incarnation of cinematic entertainment not seen before. Kubrick and Cameron are both great technical innovators who created new ways of making movie images, often stretching the technical limits of their own era and pointing a clear direction for future film makers for years to come. While Kubrick did not have access to the modern and incredibly powerful world of computer animation, he made up for it by creative tricks with cameras and stages that bamboozled the eyes. Cameron has all of that and then more. He has created a luxurious wonderland of images in 3 dimensions (of course they work best when you watch it at the cinema in 3D) and from the very first images you are drawn immediately into the drama with no let up till the end.<br/><br/>About a half hour into the film I began to take notice of the historical and film influences as they surface in the story. Right away I was of the opinion that the Pocahontas/Captain Smith story was the strongest source. That was funny for me because the great Wes Studi who was in Malick's \"The New World\" is back again (very under-utilized) as a \"native\" Na'avi in this film. Another influence and one that caught me by surprise was the 1997 Paul Verhoeven film \"Starship Troopers\".<br/><br/>It is clear that clichés appear off and on but this is the realm of myth making in Hollywood and it always works for the audience because semi consciously we are attracted to heroes of myth, be they sports or warrior stars or pop stars. We like the feeling of being in league with large groups of other like minded folks who are all into some love affair with someone.<br/><br/>Technically this film has set new standards. We get full value for the extra payment to see the 3D version. Thankfully it was not ear popping loud, as I detest films that are overly noisy. The story line, which is science fiction mixed with a loathing of large mining companies by indigenous groups mixed in with tree hugging geeky science nerds (with hat tips to Spielberg in several of his films) is fun, predictable and emotionally stirring enough to keep us alert for nearly 3 hours. The actors all gave 100% with extra kudos to the mean-assed Stephen Lang (who I loved as General Pickett in \"Gettysburg\")who gives a richly textured characterization of a villainous soldier who gladly was the willing executioner of the corporate vision. The idea that nothing much worse than a poor last quarter (of profits)is lifted right out of the current hatred of Wall Street (both the real one and the film).<br/><br/>I can see why people fall in love with this film and see it many times. There is so much going on and you maybe didn't catch a line here or there the first time. It is worth owning when available. Not the greatest film of the last 10 years but well worth all the investments that Cameron and his crew have laboured at. Terrific entertainment value. A new milestone in cinematic creativity.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Say what you will about AVATAR, but there is no avoiding it. It is truly one of the best &amp; most unique movie experiences I've ever had. Of course this was the 1st time I've ever seen a movie in 3-D + IMAX combined.<br/><br/>I still think that THE HURT LOCKER is the best film of the year only because it is THAT good. Both are (&amp; will become) classics.<br/><br/>AVATAR stands in a class completely by itself. More than 2 days later I'm still buzzing about it. Comparisons to the rush that STAR WARS gave you are entirely accurate.<br/><br/>The best thing that Cameron did with the 3-D is that he never shoves it at you. He (+ the 1000 or so other magicians who worked on this movie) allows you to wander into each frame (is that word even applicable here?) &amp; become surrounded by it. It is a totally immersive feeling. The camera movement is not content with being locked down. It moves to give you further perspective of the amazing world before you. The tech achievements are astounding &amp; I could on &amp; on about \"performance capture\" &amp; its success only to say that I felt that the Na'vi --the blue people-- were every bit as real as the humans.<br/><br/>The story is somewhat predictable &amp; there's nothing in the performances that'll rock you like Jeremey Renner's work in \"...Locker\" (although Stephen Lang is quite good as the hard core military guy). But the actors &amp; the script rise enough to make you really care about what happens to them. Zoe Saldana's Na'vi beauty &amp; spirit is quite something to marvel at (what a year she has had with this &amp; Uhura)when you later think that she was basically digital.<br/><br/>It may not be the \"movie of the year\" but, contrarily, make no mistake about it AVATAR is the movie EVENT of the decade.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Amazing... not perfect, but amazing.<br/><br/>It's difficult to add to the discussion, especially when you're one of a million-and-a-half moviegoers who saw Avatar and have already commented.<br/><br/>I'm not 'everything James Cameron touches is gold' kind of person, but he usually brings his 'A-game' when he makes a movie. With 'Titanic' he managed to once again do groundbreaking CGI to help tell a story (although I thought the story itself was saccharine-sweet sentimentality), visually it was as big as the ship itself.<br/><br/>With Avatar, the story is definitely much better, although still not as big as the effects. James Cameron is all about details in his movies and it really shows. Every nook and cranny of this film is jam-packed with information, almost to a point where you need to watch it two or three times to take it all in.<br/><br/>We've all heard about the new CGI imagery Cameron helped develop for Avatar. Even if you shake your head in disapproval in regards to the acting or storyline, I imagine most will have at least one scene they tell someone about that captivated them.<br/><br/>I won't necessarily go into the story itself because so many already have, but all-in-all, I found it okay, not over-the-top, but definitely watchable from that perspective. The acting was even and flowed well, plus there were some very funny parts thrown into the seriousness for good measure.<br/><br/>From the marketing of the trailer, I can imagine there will be a lot of kids who want to see Avatar. Is it appropriate? It all depends.<br/><br/>There is a LOT of violence and people (and aliens) getting killed (albeit, nothing too graphic). There is a good deal of intense fight scenes, destruction, etc., etc. The adult language is fairly sparse and there is one adult-themed scene that eludes to sex, but like I said about the bloodshed, nothing graphic. Some theatergoers mentioned CGI female breasts and YES, they are there, but most of the time CGI artfully conceals them. You also have to consider the running time of 2:30 hours. That alone may make parents want to wait for this to come out on video for the simple fact that some kids may get bored since there's not something exciting going on all the time.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a huge movie in more than one sense. It's also something that calls for the big screen, 3-D approach as well. I do plan on buying it when it does come to DVD, but it will probably lose quite a bit in translation.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I watched ''Avatar'' first time when it released in cinemas in 2009 and yesterday I watched it again, actually I found a lot of deference, at first time I just found it as a normal movie (TV movie) with some visual effect, but now when I watched it again I found it purely a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I saw some negative reviews and most of them wrote ''same cliché'', really guys?! What do you want more than that?! Every part in the movie is perfect starting from plot to visual effects until the performance.<br/><br/>If I want to talk about visual effects I couldn't stop, the designers of ''moon Pandora'' they couldn't design better than this, it seems so realistic and breathtaking, beside Pandora's animals, plants, trees and people, everything perfect.<br/><br/>I like the plot also, it's showing how the humans are savages, unlike others aliens movies that show the aliens are the enemy and the humans are innocents, the story is really reflecting our lives, we already ruined our earth by wars, killing animals and cutting trees, and it will be same if we control another planet.<br/><br/>''Avatar'' is one of the greatest movie in the history of cinema, and I would like to thank the genius director and writer ''James Cameron'' and the whole cast for this masterpiece, and I hope \"Avatar 2, 3 &amp; 4'' will be as same as this.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">OK, so this film is probably worth 5 or 6 *'s purely on the visuals but I had to give it a 1 to try and make up for all the people who seem to have watched it with their brain switched into neutral and given it 10's.<br/><br/>It isn't the revolution in cinema, and it doesn't make 3-D worthwhile. It already looks dated compared to the likes of District 9 which came out 6 months before it. It looks suspiciously like someone showed Cameron a raft of Anime and computer games and he thought he could do something better but without taking any notice of the inherent depth. <br/><br/>Cameron has been a fantastic film-maker but he has been on the slide and this effort is just visuals for the sake of it with not a single ounce of story to back it up. Truly the low-point in Cameron's career.</div>,\n",

Even this bad plot could have been filled with a script with more substance....oh my god! <br/><br/>I've never played a shoot'em up video game, and I am not a fan of fantasy, so maybe I should never have watched this movie. Plus, I hate pastels...;-) <br/><br/>I like CGI, but without a story ? Mr. Cameron should first have graduated at Pixar College - well, but maybe he would have flunked with flying pastels - maybe he lacks the talent...<br/><br/>It is a boring, unoriginal, bad film, a cartoon of the flattest kind. Not worth seeing at all.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is a lame fairy tale, boring and cringe-worthy, that will appeal only to those who are gullible and easily taken in by an attempt to be fantastical. I love movies and sadly, this one not only bored me to tears but sitting through it was sheer torture, nothing less. And this from James Cameron, whose Terminator and Titanic are my two favorite movies of all time and whose many other films i have seen, loved and admired. The great Sigourney Weaver, who is a class act, delivers a serviceable performance at most. Sam Worthington fares better, although one wishes at times that he had a little more of the charisma of a Leo DiCaprio or a Johnny Depp. Then there is the villain Col Quaritch who is so cartoonish he might have come straight from the pages of a comic book. The biggest tragedy of Avatar is that after all the years and money invested, the final product is so insipid, unoriginal and uninspiring. The music score doesn't come anywhere near John Barry's Dances With Wolves or James Horner's Titanic. And what is most scary is when Hollywood starts making crap movies like this, there is no hope left for mankind.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar was totally robbed at the Oscars that year by the silly movie 'hurt locker' about a bomb that might or might not go off.... such a boring shallow move. Avatar is a better movie, a huge achievement.<br/><br/>Avatar creates a new world and fills it with amazing spectacle. The message in the story is important, if simplistic but worthwhile.<br/><br/>Reflecting our own world where progress and greed impose on nature and threatens what is irreplaceable.<br/><br/>As we wrestle with our own environmental catastrophes and responsibilities, it's movies like this we need more of that remind us of our origin, mission, and choices.<br/><br/>Good solid original entertainment, Avatar demands a big high definition screen and full HD viewing. It does what other films only try to do, and that's take you on a journey away from everything for two hours, with action, suspense and technically fantastic visuals.<br/><br/>The one criticism worth mentioning is that some of the dialogue is typical cheesy Hollywood, and feels too safe. It's as if they went for \"standard\" dialogue because they didn't want to detract from the surrounding visuals. That was a mistake. They should have refined the script and made it more intelligent, with added depth to some of the story elements. That can all be forgiven however, because of the enormous scope and creativity of this great movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The last thing this artistic film needs is another review, but I can't contain the excitement I felt after viewing it.<br/><br/>I know, I'm a year late, but with that aside, I can see why the hype has been so great with this film. The artwork is one thing to boast about, its main strength, but the acting is amazing as well.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington does wonders, great, great decision to cast him as the lead. You can't help but sympathize for him and feel connected to him. Zoe Saldana also does well, those two made the film! Michelle Rodriguez is probably my favorite alternative character in this film, but needless to say, everyone excelled.<br/><br/>This film can be enjoyable for the artwork, the creativity, the ingenious storyline, the uniqueness, the amazing acting, and so much more.<br/><br/>One of my all-time favorite films, yes I believe the art made this film what it is, but that shouldn't take away from how complete of a package this film truly is.<br/><br/>Well done! Most profitable film, financially and creatively!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is undeniably sumptuous. I can quite see where the mega bucks have gone, Pandora and the whole look of the film are stunning. At first you are truly dazzled by the awesomely imagined and realised visuals on the screen in front of you. And that is part of the problem. Unfortunately, the story itself is nothing special, you can trace the roots of the tale in many of the movies over the last fifty years or so, Last Of The Mohicans and Dances with Wolves sprang instantly to mind. Followed closely by Apocalypse Now and Aliens. This isn't necessarily bad, but you feel a vague sense of disappointment when you start to recognise the markers, and can predict what's coming next. Every one of the six points I give to this movie are for the incredible visuals, true testament to CGI skill. The four points it loses for me come from the unoriginal story.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Rated lower due to length:<br/><br/>Spoilers Ahead! You may want to bow out now!<br/><br/>Clocking in at just under 3 hours, \"Avatar\" seems to miss the one salient point known by Preachers everywhere: \"The brain can absorb, ONLY what the seat can endure!\" The movie, despite its length, is a good watch, though the 3D at times, seemed more a novelty, then an enhancement to the story. More on this later.<br/><br/>The plot however, seemed to be a derivative. It was somewhere between \"Dances with Wolves\" meets \"The Matrix\" and \"The Terminator\" with a sappy love story thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>Not particularly original, but when have the offerings from Hollywood been original? (Yes that's a rhetorical question!) I was surprised to be honest, that the CGI (Computer Generated Images) were that good! I really couldn't tell where the GGI (animation) begin, and what was real. I figured the CGI would carry the story. In fact it enhanced it.<br/><br/>What didn't enhance it however, was the 3D. Besides making you wear the clunky glasses, it did give me a headache. I expected this, remembering the horrid 3D images from the 60's.<br/><br/>All in all, a good story, decently told, despite the derivative plot and political underpinings. Butt at 3 hours, I am NOT likely to see this again.<br/><br/>Wayno</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">At first I was in awe of this movie...the special effects are amazingly real looking. It was fascinating to see another world evolve before my eyes that was filled with fawn and fauna.<br/><br/>Then I waited for the story to begin...and that's when the let-down began. The movie is a $250 Million dollar cowboy and Indians picture. The earth mining company (the cowboys) want to kick the planet's inhabitants out (the Indians) so they can rape and pillage the land (the New World). The political agenda was so clear...Americans (or Europeans) are bad and all the natives of the countries they colonized (even if it was for the better) are good. It would have been far better to camouflage this agenda a little so it would not seem like a lecture.<br/><br/>I was hoping the ending would justify the rest of the movie...I was wrong there too...it was quite hard to believe that bows, arrows, and animals, would easily, and rather quickly, take down a gargantuan military force</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Visually absolutely stunning, breathtaking and technically perfect.\n",
       " As far as story goes is nothing more than a ripoff of 1957 \"Call Me Joe\" science fiction novel by Poul Anderson with added elements from Pocahontas and Dancing with the Wolves. Cameron added nothing new to above stories unfortunately, making the entire spectacle mindbogglingly unoriginal.\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is directed by James Cameron and stars Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, and ex-marine that is paralyzed from the waist down. The story follows Jake as he takes up his late twin brother's position on a space exposition to a planet called Pandora. There, he is recruited for an Avatar program, in which his conscious is transferred to a Na'vi's (the locals) body, in order to gain their trust so that humans can harvest a certain metal found on Pandora.<br/><br/>Now, the cool thing is to hate on Avatar, but I like it. It definitely isn't the best films out there, but it's certainly not bad. To jump right in, this movie has the best cinematography in cinematic history. This film is absolutely beautiful. The wide shots of Pandora and all of the wildlife sucks you in every time you watch it. The directing is also good, which is expected of James Cameron. The editing is good, which is obvious due to this movie being in production for 12 years.<br/><br/>The biggest negative starts with the acting. However, only in one spot. Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez, and Stephen Lang do amazing in their roles, and make set the tone for the acting. However, the tone is ripped down by the main role, played by Sam Worthington. For anyone who's seen Clash of the Titans or Terminator Salvation, you know that Sam Worthington isn't a good actor. He actually does better in this film that the others mentioned, but he still doesn't do well.<br/><br/>Another nit picky negative is the symbolism for the movie Dances With Wolves. I think that Dances With Wolves is a very good film, and many aspects of this movie come from that of Dances With Wolves. However, nobody can call it a direct copy, just because there are similarities. Another positive is the score. The score for this film is vigorous. Props to James Horner, one of the best movie composers out there, for the score. Some of the scenes where Jake is flying on his Ikran, the pounding score enthralls me every time I watch it. This also leads me to the topic of rewatchability. I've watched this movie plenty of times, and it doesn't really get old. That is a big positive for this film.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Avatar is much better than most people say it is. The directing, cinematography, score, and mostly good acting easily outweigh the bad acting and similarities with other films. Avatar gets a B+, or an 8 out of 10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Green Mansions\" meets \"The Emerald Forest\" meets any number of \"Stars Wars\" movies. The special effects of this film constantly threaten to overwhelm any semblance of plot or character development. Basically, however, it's a retelling of a story done many times before - higher technology newcomers threaten the habitat of bonding-with-nature natives. Goodness and purity win out (unlike in many historical realities) and the lovers (one from each of the two conflicting societies) survive to live happily ever after. The plot is so predictable, however, that it even includes the trite cliché of the action going from epic battle scenes to a final one-on-one showdown of Our Hero and his personal nemesis, the evil bloodthirsty commander of the mechanized invaders (See Gibson, Mel, in \"The Patriot\"). As dramatized here the plot goes even a step further, with Our Hero one blow away from death at the hands of his nemesis when his female love interest comes to his rescue (See Cooper, Gary, in \"High Noon\"). Basically this film can be summed up as: \"Unoriginal story presented in a spectacular package.\"</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Was that how the pitch meeting for Avatar started? You have to admit, there are parallels, in story and in theme, with the 1990 successful-in-every-possible-way Kevin Costner film. A soldier joins the ranks of an oppressed culture and becomes one of them. Eventually he is fighting against the society he swore to protect. <br/><br/>Seems to me that in the look, the culture, even language he gives to the Na'vi, James Cameron wants them remind you of native Americans. I thought as I watched it, how could the American military be so cold as to force people off of their land out of greed? Ah but we did do it. Avatar is meant to symbolize what happened to America's aboriginal people.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Normally if a film has an underwhelming plot it takes a lot to make up for it. Visuals, for me, contribute little when weighing up pros and cons. In the case of Avatar thought it is safe to say that the visuals are something special. I knew that they were good after hearing other reviews, but they really blew me away, they have to be some of the best I have ever seen. Marks also have to be given for the sheer imaginative genius involved. The story isn't particularly brilliant or original for that matter, but the amount of effort that has obviously been put into the creation and the design of world kind of makes up for it. The story obviously draws on influences from fiction and real life. There is some Pocahontas in their as well as some Star Wars, and it obviously has something to say about conflict, especially in the wake of recent military campaigns in the Middle East. I did enjoy the film, even if the plot sometimes did move at a snails pace despite the action sequences running at full speed. I sometimes felt as though nothing had happened to further the plot for a good while, but I was still generally interested in what was going on, it could have done with being maybe half and hour shorter.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The movie was very definitely blockbuster; better than \"Return of the Jedi\", and better than most of the classic Vietnam War movies I had seen, including \"Deerhunter\" and even \"Platoon\". \"Avatar\" literally blows all of those movies away.<br/><br/>There are several particular parts that I adored in the flick.<br/><br/>First, I liked the downfall of Hometree. The way the Sky People destroyed Hometree was amazing enough. Just hearing the word \"destroy\" means one big thing--special effects. <br/><br/>Seeing the 3-prong approach to the Hometree destruction--first by the tear gas canisters that stunned the Na'vi, and then the incendiary bombs that looked like small Napalm bombs, which was a reminder of the Vietnam war, and then, the final destruction by missiles...means that this is going to be something out of a Las Vegas style implosion...plenty of explosives to penetrate and weaken the Hometree columns. So, I guess that means get ready for some big fireworks!! And there were!<br/><br/>I liked the sixth-sense attitude when the avatar good-guy soldier, Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington) warned the Na'vi that they will blow the columns of Hometree.<br/><br/>After the fireworks of the Sky People gunships destroying the Hometree columns were over, I can see the columns in flames. Then I see the flames increase in size and then, the crackles begin. I knew in that moment that Hometree had met its fate--it was coming down--big time! The tree does comes down and kills one of the Na'vi leaders, and the Sky People got what they deserved..a destruction of a big piece of the Na'vi culture. When the Sky People gunship personnel turned for home after their accomplished mission, they had a very slight sense at that point to target \"The Tree of Souls\", which was unscathed.<br/><br/>The stockade escape was another scene I like. Especially the way Trudy Chacon (played by Michelle Rodriguez) set the escape up. After Trudy frees Grace (played by Sigourney Weaver) and run outside to commandeer a helicopter, the Sky People ranger gets word of the escape and fires his automatic weapon at the escapees. At this point, the only problem was that their was a filmmaker's miss on the bullet hit to Grace's chest. There is no obvious squib explosion to tell you that Grace got hit by the Ranger until Grace says, as soon as she saw the bullet wound, \"This is going to ruin my day!\" And Trudy did not even know that Grace's wound would eventually worsen her condition to terminal.<br/><br/>The following scene where Sully takes Grace to the Tree of Souls for the so-called Na'vi's incarnation towards their deity, Eywa, was perhaps the most moving part of the movie--and the most pathetic. Very good scene. Here, the Na'vi priestess attempted to let the synapses of the tree go through Grace's body to try to resurrect her. The synapses light up as the Na'vi genuflect and chant, and then fade away. The chanting ends. Unfortunately, Sully was informed that the resurrection did not work and Grace passed away; the reason was that her injuries were terminal. The Eywa incarnation is like the Act 1 Incarnation Scene in Verdi's \"Aida\" where the Egyptian high priestess honors the Egyptian deity, \"Phtah\". Moreover, it is also a reminder of the same scene in \"Star Trek III: The Search of Spock\", where there was a successful incarnation that resurrected Spock to life.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Visually, Avatar is probably the most stylish and groundbreaking film in the history of cinema. Its use of CGIs and visual effects are truly at whole another level from everything else I have seen. This technique may be the first of its kind. This a science fiction/war story with strong dramatic elements. Humans are colonizing another planet due to its rich resources and they engage in a battle with the planet local inhabitants (the blue creatures). At the end, it is a classic battle between strong evil enemy and the less powerful, good guys. I think the ending was contrived and unrealistic. Something about it just didn't feel right. I think it could have been written better, more intelligently, but it felt as if they wanted to bank on the visuals so they stretched the story to include more action scenes which, in my opinion, is the only downfall of this movie. I still think it should have won the best picture (instead of The Hurt Locker).</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's films, many times, have been about humanity's love/hate relationship with a cold-blooded or machine-like opposition. There's machine vs. human conflict in Terminator movies. Insect-like aliens go against humans in Aliens. Titanic was about human technology vs. the harshness of nature, in relations to human pride and dependence on technology. In Avatar, the tribal humanoids of Pandora are the more humane, while the actual humans are more machine-like (in their dependency of technology). His frequent use of a strong female character is also in display here, embodied in the character of Neytiri. And, of course, he loves using the color blue in all his films, and there is a lot of it here, not only in the amazing scenery, but the tribal characters are all blue as well.<br/><br/>The story of Avatar is pretty simple and one can pretty much call it an animated version of Dances with Wolves, plot-wise, mixed in with a bit of Princess Mononoke. James Cameron's Avatar makes great use of 3-D technology to bring his fantastic visuals to life. At the same time, I've noticed that humans tend not to look as realistic in 3-D. Perhaps it's from years and years of training our eyes to accept 2-D imagery as real. All the computer generated (CG) characters and places, however, are better enhanced by this 3-D technology, whereas they may not seem as real or convincing otherwise. The colors are brilliant, the details are amazing, and the expressions of the characters are both subtle and spot-on. Does this movie truly innovate the use of this technology? I wouldn't go that far (unlike Terminator 2's use of \"morphing\"), but it does show that CG characters can truly flourish, especially with this 3-D medium. If the whole movie was CG with no live action, it would still work quite well (and would be consistent).<br/><br/>The human actors do what they can with the amount of live action time given. Most of the time, subtleties feel lost in the realm of live action 3-D. Sam Worthington, admittedly, is more interesting as the blue humanoid, and in this case, perhaps even a better actor because of it. Zoe Saldana (Uhura of Star Trek) plays a CG-fied version of herself as Neytiri. Many character movements have been made with motion capture, and the expressions and movements of Neytiri are full of life and beautiful to look at, which also bring a lot of heart to her character. Rest of the CG characters all come off quite well, and despite the fact that they look a little odd initially, one gets quite used to them and all the creatures in this fantastic world that Cameron has created in great detail. The lighting of the scenes and various plant life and strange creatures all feel like they belong, despite how odd they look—they all move and breathe like real creatures in their own way.<br/><br/>One can parallel the film to almost any sociopolitical theme, past and present, that involves people's use of military force for greed of resources and/or destruction of nature. Unlike the humans, the Na'vi in the film are peace-loving people and somehow connects with all of nature harmoniously, and there seems to be something not unlike The Force (from Star Wars) added in there. With all this peace-loving stuff, one wonders how it happens that creatures still viciously eat and kill each other (but I'll leave that alone). Na'vi also have this receptacle thing at the ends of their lock of hair that can connect to and communicate with other animals, who also have a similar receptacle, kind of like a USB port. It's all pretty neat and convenient. Contrast to this, the humans here are not as friendly. Stephen Lang plays Col. Miles Quaritch, a tough, military commander who does whatever it takes to get the Na'vi's to move from their land. Giovanni Ribisi plays Parker Selfridge who spearheads the operation—he's kind of like the greedy lawyer, Burke, from Aliens. Quaritch and Selfridge both are played with a bit of an old-fashioned bad-guy gusto that can come off a bit two-dimensional (to the service of the story). In the end, one will certainly root for the Na'vi—after all, it's their land, they are peace-loving, and the whole planet seems to agree with them.<br/><br/>James Cameron is famous for his great action scenes, and seeing how all the creatures move and react and the way CG vehicles crash all feel \"right.\" Many directors love to cheese-it-up with tons of explosions and fluid/rubbery/stretchy machines (Michael *COUGH* Bay), but much of that is kept with a bit more restraint. With that said, the film is more of an adventure story than an action flick. Much of the time (the movie is 2 hours, 40 minutes long) is spent allowing us to get to know Pandora and its inhabitants, which fortunately is interesting most of the time.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the movie to be quite enjoyable—it may not live up to the hype as the work of great achievement in 3-D, but it's a good achievement. The CG characters fare better than the human counterparts in almost every way, which is both good and a bad thing. We need the humans there to show that we're supposed to accept Na'vi not as a cartoon, but humans aren't as fluid or interesting or real as they are. The lands of Pandora are beautiful, even if it is a little too good (and convenient) to be true. The story, as mentioned, isn't anything new, and dialogue could use a little more edge. Still, the execution is very good, and it is solid visual entertainment. I give Avatar *** out of **** stars.<br/><br/>More of my reviews can be found at http://twitter.com/d_art</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Watching Avatar I felt like I was trapped in a pastel landscape. All the colours in this movie are bright greens, blues and pinks. I wondered for a while why this was familiar but then it dawned on me that it's oceanic landscapes which James Cameron obviously has an affinity for, judging from his previous record.<br/><br/>The storyline is very basic here. Big bad imperialists come to a planet to rape it and steal a precious stone which is worth lots of money, the stone in this case is \"hillariously\" referred to as 'unobtainium'. The natives of course must all be crushed, conquered and moved away from the precious resource. It has shades of the 2003 Iraq War but the metaphor is developed poorly and it's never especially subtle. At one point an invasion on the native peoples is referred to as \"shock and awe\".<br/><br/>The idea of avatars, creatures created from human DNA but meant to look like the native aliens is interesting. The invaders download their brain into the avatar and then walk around among the natives. Humans are the invaders in this story, it's supposed to be a flip-side version of Aliens, but we still have those robotic machines people get into which mimic their movements. It's a James Cameron trope now.<br/><br/>James Cameron isn't an especially good writer. I think that much was obvious when he strayed from science-fiction with Titanic. Almost everything about that movie was good except for the acting and writing, which is a pretty major flaw in any movie. The writing isn't much better in Avatar, there are a lot of eye-rolling cornball lines. Clichés like \"We're not in Kansas anymore\" are quite prevalent here. None of the characters are as well manicured as the CGI and other effects. The only real stand-out performance here, even for an action movie, is Sigorney Weaver, and she mostly rehashes her performance from the Alien movies. Sam Worthington is adequate but he never really wowed me either with his performance of a disabled Marine who gets the chance to bounce around a forest with fairy tale creatures.<br/><br/>The effects are okay but the design is pretty hokey at times. I didn't care much for the pallet of colours that Cameron used here. There's a lot of magical and mythical creatures flying around, Cameron really wanted us to see this world he has created but then he forgot about all the characters. The only Na'vi character we really get to know is Jake Sully's girlfriend, Neytiri. The rest are pretty much dismissed and blend into the blue backgrounds except when they are required for the final attack on the humans.<br/><br/>The final confrontation is pretty bad as well. The major characters all end up in peril of course and James Horner's score reaches its irritating crescendo. The odds are obviously stacked against the native Na'vi but this is fiction, in James Cameron's world anything is possible.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">'Avatar' is an action-packed, pulse-pounding, visually astounding, multi-million dollar blockbuster that assaults every available human sense violently for two hours and thirty minutes leaving the audience with a grin the size of Pandora on their faces. You have probably seen incarnations of the story, heard the B-Movie-esquire terrible dialogue and experienced the structure of 'Avatar' numerous times before. But the real beauty, the real of heart of this film lies in the wonderful world of Pandora that James Cameron has created.<br/><br/>In 2154, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) a paraplegic ex-marine is sent to take his brothers place in the Avatar program on a planet named Pandora. Pandora is home to the Na'vi, a sentient alien race that is currently living upon the largest unobtainium (1kg is worth over $20 million) deposit within travelling distance to Earth. The Avatar program, run by Dr Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and financed by the Resources Development Administration, is focused around producing and controlling genetically engineered human-Na'vi hybrids.<br/><br/>These human-Na'vi hybrid characters, controlled by the human surrogate's consciousness, allow the humans to enter the Na'vi's community and engage, teach and learn from the race. With the sole intention of the RDA being to remove the Na'vi from their home through diplomacy so they may obtain the unobtainium with minimal causalities as the complete annihilation of a race \"does not play well with the media.\" However, old-school Military Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) simply wants to go in quick and with an iron fist. As Jake starts to become more and more attached to the Na'vi community, his loyalties become increasingly torn between that of his initial objectives and his adopted race, including his alien love-interest Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).<br/><br/>The narrative, structure and human characters are recycled components from the various hundreds, if not thousands, of Sci-Fi Action films made previous to 'Avatar'. From the slow-developing inter-galactic relationship between Jake and Neytiri, to the stereotypical 'hard-ass' Marine leader Colonel Quaritch (he's Sgt Hartman's second cousin) and climaxing with a predictable, yet comfortable conclusion. You will have seen and experienced it all before, including the terrible script which contains many cringe-worthy one-liners. However, technically Cameron has created a very proficient film overall. He paces the film perfectly and continually drives the narrative forward with some concise editing, while the cinematography and special effects, well, they truly bring forth the world of Pandora and immerse the audience within.<br/><br/>From the first scene in which Jake's Na'vi avatar is let loose in the forest under the midnight sky, to the final beautiful concluding scene, the stunning landscape of Pandora is what creates, combines and blends together the mythical nature of James Cameron's 'Avatar'. Every scene, every animal, every organism, is crafted in huge detail and depth to create an astonishing world of beauty that you just can't help but sit back and admire. And this allows you to forget about the fact that the story is thin and clichéd or that the majority of the characters are two-dimensional pieces of computer wizardry and simply enjoy what can only be called; a film-making spectacle. Cameron hasn't created anything revolutionary here, but with the technology he has created and bestowed upon the cinematic community, it will certainly help along the three-dimensional train, and hopefully win over those who think 3D is nothing more than a cheap gimmick.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I ca n't remember the plot right now. I just remember that this is the first 3d film I watched. It's so great!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar (3D version) is certainly a different experience, a visual show but nothing more. I still can't believe Cameron came with such a weak story. I really started to believe CGI is destroying the whole concept of cinema. Recently, directors are spending a fortune on technical things and don't care about plot or other things that make something a movie. I wouldn't regret watching the Avatar but there is really nothing new except the fancy visuals. The story is a combination of The Last Samurai, Pocahontas, Matrix and Dances with the Wolves. It is so predictable that I felt insulted. This can't be the movie Cameron was working on for years. This movie will get a lot Oscars, no doubt but I hope directors don't get the wrong impression. We do care about other aspects than fancy visuals and we won't buy such a weak story again...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I really like these blue tall creatures, Avatars. They are all friendly, kind and sincere.Some scenes in the movie are really beautiful.The director's imagination is amazing.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Just as I did in Star Trek, I'm going to again single out Zoe Saldana as the one who walks off with the show. Granted this time her wonderful performance is only made possible through the truly, truly astounding work the tech guys did on bringing the Na'vi to life, but still, her character (well-written, strong, developed) is all her own. She's like a proper kick-ass, fully-formed, independent, very sexy (yes you read that right; move over Jessica Rabbit) fiery, spunky heroine, and I thought she was awesome. It's her - not Sam Worthington and her, just her - who gives the film such real heart and means the emotional stuff really does work exactly as it was intended to.<br/><br/>In 3D IMAX the spectacle is immense. I don't quite know what I was expecting for this - my first time seeing either 3D or IMAX - but as soon as I walked in I dialled down my expectations a touch. The whole 3D thing is brilliant, and although I unfortunately had the projectionist's reflection at the extreme right of my vision, and - undoubtedly due to my somewhat poor eyesight - it occasionally became a little \"squinty\" around the edges, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not all of Pandora is photo-real (and alarmingly, not in the opening shot!) but much of it is. And I mean photo-real. The thrilling first scene set at night, with the forest illuminated only by a touch of moonlight and Jake's flaming torch is for me the technical standout (the Na'vi notwithstanding) because everything in the frame looked absolutely real, yet none of it was. At many times during the film I had no idea where to put my eyes. There was so much going on, and the screen was so big, the detail so vivid, the design so spectacular.<br/><br/>My major fears about the content of the film itself proved unfounded. No it's not a groundbreaking plot, but the presentation makes it feel - if not new - certainly nowhere near as hackneyed as it might seem on paper. The characterisation is about what you'd expect from a film of its type, and if Sam Worthington doesn't make much of an impression as Jake, Saldana, the always-brilliant Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver all impress to one degree or another. Thanks to the technical achievements the plight of the Na'vi is often heartbreaking. They're big blue aliens but before long they were as real to me as anything else. Once key scene where they're subjected to a horrendous attack seems to last forever, and is a forceful and tragic piece of cinema the likes of which modern Hollywood event pictures never see. This was the part where I was closest to welling up, although there was a touch of that kind of thing towards the end.<br/><br/>The Iraq/Afghanistan allusions (is that the right word?) are blatant; impossible to miss. I personally don't think that counts as heavy-handed though, not in this kind of film. Cameron's not making an allegory here, he's not making a political point, he's not even asking us to think. He's merely saying \"What happens on Pandora has many similarities to what's happening in Iraq and Afghanistan\" and nothing more.<br/><br/>The action sequences are spaced out nicely and none of them outstay their welcome as is almost always the case in my opinion. They're approached in the same visionary manner as everything else that even the familiar seems fresh. The final battle was awesome (even if Jake's pathetic rallying speech before it was a shocking damp squib.) The humour - all of it - works.<br/><br/>The score is good, but it blatantly rips off Enemy at the Gates at one point, and Aliens in another.<br/><br/>I have a feeling this rating will go down on subsequent viewings, but as it stands now I can't find significant fault with it; its strengths and achievements tower over and so thoroughly dominate what weaknesses it may have; and I honestly can't remember the last time I was this excited about a film after I've seen it that it's top marks from me.<br/><br/>The sheer magnitude of that scene where they're destroying Hometree was staggering. I thought, They're not going to nuke it? Well then how will they destroy something that huge? Then the ships lined up and started a very familiar, almost mundane pounding. And pounding. And I realised that's how they were going to do it. Endless waves of artillery. They're just going to keep chipping away at this noble tree with their ignoble weapons until it falls. That was all just tragic to me. It's a testament to the writing, the acting and the CGI that this destruction felt so... wrong.<br/><br/>I loved Jake fending off the \"dogs\" before he meets Netiri. As great as anything I've seen in recent sci-fi. Loved the design of everything, especially inside Hometree with the vines. That exhilarating ride/climb/jump (!!!) up to the Hallelujah Mountains was another standout moment; in fact the whole sequence was. As they leapt from the tip of that vine my heart jumped into my throat along with them. Later when Jake's wrestling that banshee and he slips over the edge I had a similar reaction. Breathtaking stuff.<br/><br/>It's rare these days to get a proper, honest-to-goodness look at something (Quantum of Solace, Transformers step forward) but Cameron's eye is so keen that he's confident enough in everything to put it all up there on the screen. Ebert was right about the way he spent the money. Every penny is up there, without question.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Saw this in 3D Imax and highly recommend it in this medium. I am sure it is also outstanding in the standard format but the visuals ARE the movie and if you have a 3D screen within driving distance, definitely take advantage and go see it.<br/><br/>The plot itself is somewhat generic. It's the stereotypical military / industrial complex (i.e. – The USA) exploiting the natural resources of indigenous peoples (i.e. – Iraq) with ruthless and inhuman efficiency. The protagonist is Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) who is an Army soldier who is transformed into one of the indigenous natives in order to better exploit them (ie. – steal their oil, or \"unobtainium\" in the film). The natives are 9 feet tall blue people who can communicate with other organic beings in their universe through their hair. If this sounds dumb, it is. But the visuals are stunning and well worth putting up with the D grade movie plot.<br/><br/>I don't have much else to say about his movie. Dumb plot and insipid dialog, but breathtaking technical wizardry making this an incredible experience.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Return to the beginning of the film, let the audience marvel, let the audience moved, let the audience happy, let the audience cry. \"Avatar\" tells you: let the movie dream for you!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's sci-fi epic finally arrives having gestated in the filmmakers mind for longer than a decade. Is his vision of the future just as fresh in 2009 or is should this avatar be terminated? There's one thing you have to give Cameron, he is like the postman...he delivers; granted sometimes he may be a little late but if there 's one filmmaker you can always rely on its Cameron. I haven't disliked a Cameron movie to date, in fact I've loved, almost, everything he's done; with the exception of course being Piranha II but let's not get into that. Avatar is a razor-sharp reminder of how epic film-making is done. Not since Return of The King has epic been done on a scale this big.<br/><br/>A paraplegic ex-marine finds a new life on the distant planet of Pandora, only to find himself battling humankind alongside the planet's indigenous Na'vi race in this ambitious digital 3-D sci-fi epic from Academy Award-winning Titanic director James Cameron. <br/><br/>The story ticks all the right boxes, at least for a Cameron film. It's got good guys with guns, bad guys with even bigger guns and appalling guys with even bigger guns. It's far from original and won't come up at this week's book club. This said it's very engaging and the people, and aliens, involved are interesting. The film goes to great length in order to develop its characters so we feel the hardship and pain when they fall in battle. The film does an excellent job of keeping a good pace. Its near impossible to get bored whilst watching the film and this may have been the quietest i have ever seen an audience. It's an engaging trek through uncharted lands that, while feeling very familiar, is a brand new assault on the senses.<br/><br/>James Cameron has spent a long time in incubation, flitting around on submarines, but if \"Avatar is a reminder of anything it's a reminder that he's the best the industries got. His harsh, no-nonsense approach to film-making has landed him with one of the most polished pieces of art of the century and for that I take my hat off to you. This may be the most polished movie of the decade, sweeping, epic and ... dare I say flawless? Not quite. As far as the direction goes however, it's close enough and ranks, for me, as Cameron's second best film to date, behind \"Aliens\". IN the hands of any other director this could have gone terribly wrong; anybody other than Cameron may have played it safe delivering a spectacle, but an underwhelming one. Cameron pushes so many boundaries with one single film that it's hard not to stand up and cheer once the final credits roll. This film has pushed the limitation of the cinema medium and emerged as one of the finest film of the decade. And dare I say a classic? The acting is exceptional. Nothing warms my heart more than seeing Weaver and Cameron united for the first time since she stood toe to toe with the alien queen. She is astounding and gives an electrifying performance as Dr. Grace Augustine a woman split between two worlds. What's funny is the fact that she is not the strongest actor in the film. If anybody deserves a standing ovation is has to be Zoe Saldana who completely transforms into this other worldly thing. If you had gone into the movie not knowing that that was her you would never had guessed she was even human. She is unrecognisable and exhilarating as Neytiri who is, without a doubt, the standout role of the film. Other congratulations must be given to Sam Worthington who shows us that Terminator Salvation was not just beginners luck. Michelle Rodriguez gives a stellar turn as Trudy Chacon and ends up the way Rodriguez usually ends up. That however would be too much information.<br/><br/>Now for the pièce de résistance the reason you've already booked your ticket, the reason you're so sceptical, the reason the hype for this film is so large. The presentation. To call it out of this world would be an understatement. It's stunning. Sun all those pre conceived judgement and see for yourself. The sheer scope of the film is impeccable. This film will have you clambering through the jungle on horseback, soaring on the back of a banshee and just when you've taken in the sights and sounds Pandora has to offer you've bee blinded be the beautiful destruction on the final act. Any filmmaker that can make such destruction rather beautiful is a mastermind in my opinion.<br/><br/>Verdict: Avatar is far more than a movie, it's a cinematic experience. This is a visually assault on the senses and something that is destined to change cinema forever. It's utterly gorgeous; all backed up with scene stealing acting, fantastic direction and, wait for it, the mother of all battle scenes. Believe the hype; Cameron has delivered one of the best films of the decade and something that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. I'll be waiting in anticipation for the sequel; just don't be too long will you?</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've seen this movie twice now; both times in 3D.<br/><br/>The visuals are spectacular without a doubt. James Cameron has always been on the leading edge of breaking new ground in special effects. You are really immersed in the world of Pandora.<br/><br/>The plot though leaves something to be desired. Basically, you have the hero with a tragic past who goes on a mission for the bad guys. He meets up with the locals and realizes that he was working for the bad guys and changes sides and all the clichéd characters are there from the evil gung-ho Marine colonel to the jealous but noble native warrior.<br/><br/>If you've seen Dances with Wolves or Last Samurai, or The Mission or any of a dozen of movies with a plot line like that, then you've seen this and you know exactly what is going to happen.<br/><br/>Then we come to the plot holes.<br/><br/>1. It took the ship 5 years to get to Pandora. Sully's brother had trained for 3 years prior to this for the \"mission.\" So they had a mission almost 10 years in the making? The situation on the ground in Pandora wouldn't have changed in that 10 years? Really? I mean it looked like the operation on Pandora was relatively new...I'm pretty sure the evil corporation would have gone ahead and knocked down the tree long before Sully got to the planet. 8 years is a long time.<br/><br/>2. Unobtainium....really? That was the best James Cameron could come up with? So it's a rare material but what does it do? Surely, Cameron could have come up with something better than that.<br/><br/>3. If arrows couldn't penetrate the cockpit windshields in the scene where they destroy the hometree, then how could they do so in the final battle? 4. Speaking of the military equipment...wow, pretty flimsy. The heavy machineguns are obviously just M-60's with a few pieces of metal (or rubber) slapped on the sides. But the transports were pretty vulnerable to...just about everything. In 150 years, that's the best we've come up with? The mech-warrior things were cool but again...pretty vulnerable. I have to wonder if this was the part of the movie that James Cameron came up with 15 years ago and just didn't notice that the trend is unmanned.<br/><br/>5. If the vortex cause all sorts of complications with the instruments in the transports...why were communications unaffected and why wasn't the Avatar program disrupted in there as well? 6. So the master plan to defeat the Navi was to fly a slow-moving transport aircraft as a makeshift bomber to bomb the tree? They couldn't bomb the place from orbit? And before someone jumps on me for the gravitational flux or whatever...no. They were able to get orbital imagery so they could have easily just fired some cruise missiles or whatever the future evil corporation has and carpet bombed that whole region. The first rule of combat is to kill your enemy from as far away as possible and a former (or current) Marine Recon Lt Col would know that.<br/><br/>8. As for the end battle...what was the ground assault for? The main effort was to bomb the tree into oblivion, right? So...why send in your ground troops who were already outnumbered? Why not just send in your fast attack ships to just fire incendiary rockets at the tree and call it a day? 7. The Avatar Navi bodies were genetically engineered to reach full maturity in a short amount of time...you gotta think that such engineering would also cause a short lifespan for such a creature. After all, Sully and his brother before him were supposed to be on a 6 year mission so why create something to last longer? Not a big point but it'd be interesting to see in Avatar 2 that Jake Sully's avatar begins a rapid decline in health, haha.<br/><br/>8. So the evil corporation just left before they got punched in the nose? Yeah, they wouldn't just come back with more firepower or anything and just blast like a 1,000 square kilometer area into smoldering ruin from where they would build a new base.<br/><br/>I suppose the message Cameron is sending is \"hey, don't pay attention to the flimsy plot line, look how beautiful this world is that I created!\" The other messages were just lame. Hey James Cameron, Bush isn't in office any more and hopefully you weren't saying that Saddam Hussein was like the Navi...because yeah, you can bet that Hussein would have been 10 times as worse as the evil mercenaries were.<br/><br/>And the irony of this film which cost upwards of 400 million to make and took the cutting edge of technology and probably had quite a carbon footprint...yet technology is evil and we should all go back to nature where there will be complete harmony......yeah.....</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The thing i love and respect about this movie is the amount of effort and hard work James Cameron put inti this project, it is evident in the whole film. You can tell it took him around 10 years to create Pandora, he has attention to detail as the nature of the planet can be seen to be created with such detail and with a realistic touch. I respect James Cameron for fully committing himself to make a believable fantasy world full of attention to detail. The cinematography is breathtaking, amazing visual, CGI effects, a visual treat for the eyes. Some people may say that the storyline and acting let the film down. But in my opinion i don't fully take this film. I agree that it's not the most original idea for the film but i don't see it as weak. I think it is the foundation of the amazing journey Jake Sully and Neytiri take and the emotion was evident. Zoe Salanda stole the show as even though she was shielded by the blue CGI skin her emotion and amazing performance shone through and you could real feel that raw emotion from her. I love this film, i think it's great and worth the watch.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Reading the negative reviews here caused me to be predisposed to disliking this flick because the themes heavily criticized, such as left wing liberal ideology along with silly myths about aboriginal populations particularly annoy me. Since my wife was insistent that we do see this one, I tagged along. I am glad I did because I enjoyed the movie enormously.<br/><br/>First let me dispose with much of the negativity. The go go US military uber alles complaint that this movie celebrates the defeat of the US military is simply wrong. It's not even partly right. There is nothing correct about this complaint. The 'soldiers' in the movie are mostly or entirely from the US military but they are all separated permanently. This is not a military op of any nation much less the US. The movie just cannot be plainer that this is the case. The main protagonist goes to great lengths to say that he was ONCE a marine, now he's just a guy earning a paycheck.<br/><br/>The second complaint most often heard here is that this movie's plot is similar, to a great degree, to many other movies such as Dances With Wolves or Pocahontas or even Ferngully. That this movie is similar to many other movies just proves that there are many movies with similar themes. Funny I can't find any complaint about rom-coms that they are similar to other rom-coms but they sure are. How many sports movies have you seen where the underdog team made up of miserable misfits and being coached by a drunken loser lost in the quarter finals? So what did you expect or want - that the mercenaries would defeat the aliens and maybe use their skulls as decoration for their quarters? C'mon, here, let's get real.<br/><br/>On the positive side, unless you have a drastically limited attention span, this movie is a visual treat from start to finish. It moves well along and probably merits several viewings to appreciate all the attention to detail which is apparent even at first viewing.<br/><br/>The story is uplifting (even if kinda bunkum) the soaring views wonderfully imagined and the players all did a great job of taking their parts and making them come alive.<br/><br/>If you aren't seeing this one because you don't wish to see the US defeated, then see it because you won't. Defeated is a *private* corporation supported by mercenaries - not the US. In fact, the corporation is a joint project owned by Iran and North Korea.<br/><br/>Keep that in mind and then get back to me about how you feel about its defeat.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">What not to say about James Cameron? Director of two of the greatest sequels ever made, \"Aliens\" and \"Terminator 2\".....a pioneer in the special effects department that has help set the norm for future film making. And when he was pressed about how his movies have to only maintain special effects for him to make an entertaining movie, he goes out and makes \"True Lies\"...probably one of the most entertaining action movies ever made. And say what you will about \"Titanic\", but that movie is EPIC whether you like it or not. But for a director of this caliber to sit back and work on just one movie for the past 7 years, your expectations have to be high. Well i must say this.......i was not alive when the original \"Star Wars\" was released, but i can somewhat grasp how audiences felt when they first saw it. Now i can actually compare the feeling. The first thing i must talk about is the special effects. The word 'astounding' is a major understatement. The effects in this movie are enough to melt out your eyeballs. Where there is no major sequence that has you saying, \"Oh my god, that looks so real\", even though its as close as you can get.........where this movie really excels is in the detail. You can go and see this movie a second time, and take notice to the things going on in the background that you never saw the first time around. And not only is is there a lot going on, each little thing is done to perfection. But the thing that was perfected more than anything was the digital photography of the Avatar's faces. I thought that Robert Zemeckis had achieved a pinnacle with \"A Christmas Carol\".......but this movie has pushed that bar as high as it can possibly go. Case in point.......you know how you see those digital movies, and the characters faces look a little stoned faced, not a lot of moment.......and their mouth and teeth don't seem to match their face........um, this movie has it locked down. It was so realistic, i cannot even explain. Those close up shots of the Avatars faces are the most priceless scenes in the movie......because after a while, your mind really does convince you that these things are in fact real. So am i comparing this movie to the original Star Wars........you damn right i am. And i think everyone knows how big of a statement that is. I cannot stress how detailed this movie is. Now the special effects are top notch, but you need a decent enough story to go along with it........well, the story is not 100% original. It somewhat relates to the whole \"Dances with Wolves\" theme, but it takes a somewhat more a different spin. By that i mean the symbolism. Mainly towards the Native Americans. The overall message of this movie is as clear and brilliant as the special effects. I don't want to go into detail and explain it, because finding it out and seeing it for yourself for the first time is all apart of the process. But the story is grand, and it does a fantastic job and transferring you back and forth from both the Human world, and the Avatar world. And after a while, you feel as the character does, and grow more attached to the Avatar world, more than the real world......which im sure was Camerons original intention. But heres the main thing with this movie. The story may not be super entertaining to you at first........but once you give it time to settle in, you really begin to dwell on its subtext, and in that moment you slowly begin to love it more and more. It really is the next step in the evolution of Sci-Fi. The detail of the story, the characters, the planet, and oh my god the creatures..... its a little too much to handle at first, but once you settle in its warm waters, you don't want to get out. Also, im glad that it never took full advantage of the 3-D. By that i mean, they didn't purposely throw in sequences that had a gun pointing directly at the camera to make the audience go \"WOAH!\". It did it to make you feel like you were actually there. And once again, it over achieved in that department as well. Bottom Line......im going to quote Roger Ebert here....\"Its nice to see that someone in Hollywood knows how to spend 250 million dollars wisely.\" James Cameron has not disappointed at all. You can clearly see that he took his precious little time in perfecting every aspect of this movie......well, maybe except the dialogue, it could have used just a little more work, but it was still entertaining non the less. Is this movie worth all the hype? Uh.......you better believe it is. I mean come on people, this is what blockbusters are suppose to be like..........not like \"G.I Joe\" or \"Transformers 2\".......some half cooked script with good special effects. This movie has set a new standard on so many levels. The year 2009 has been dominated with pioneering Sci-Fi movies......and i cannot think of a better way to end it, than with this one. Hands down one of the best movies of this year.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It is a visually stunning movie in every way, but I think they went overboard with the extended (but still unique) storyline making it an almost 3 hour movie. When movies start getting past the 2 hour mark, I personally start to lose interest and get bored. I don't think there was enough to keep me interested, aside from the amazing CGI.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar was possibly the most hyped film of the last decade. For the die-hard fans of James Cameron, the film is not likely to disappoint, but for the rest of us, it is little more than a decent adventure.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view, the film was said to revolutionize film-making, and I have to say it is certainly one of the most impressive films I have seen, effects-wise. I can only imagine how much work it takes to create the characters inhabiting Pandora, not to mention the astounding landscapes. It is truly a wonder to behold, and the nature is so detailed that the main reason I have to rewatch it is to find new flowers and animals.<br/><br/>The story, on the other hand, is average at best. It is about the planet Pandora, whose natural resources (cheesily named unobtainium) makes it attractive to the exploitative US army. On the other side of the spectrum, there are scientists who only want to observe the planet because of its rich nature and advanced ecological system. In between these extremes, we find Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic ex-marine, who, in the shape of his avatar, can walk again. One can only imagine what he feels like when inhabiting his avatar, which is an interesting touch cinematically because the planet therefore offers as much escapism for Jake as it does for the film viewer.<br/><br/>\"We will fight terror with terror.\" This line, said by the hilariously over the top villain, a super evil American colonel (Stephen Lang) is one of the best examples of how overtly political Avatar is. This is not a bad thing per se; indeed, the message is quite admirable, but I can't help but feel that James Cameron is hitting the viewer over the head, much like Crash did five years ago. We know that violence is bad and that it is bad to exploit other cultures just because you have superior weapon force, so there is really no need to rub it in as much as Avatar does. It is also ironic, then, that the ultimate solution to the problem is a military counter-attack. Although to be fair, it would have been a bit of an anticlimax if the film ended with a big act of diplomacy.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his brother have been cryogenically frozen for five and a half years. When he comes out of the state his brother is dead and has left an investment to work on a planet known as Pandora. He will make a lot of money for taking his brothers place since he has the same genetic order. He told himself that he do anything a marine could do and has the will to be the best. Every marine was told of the humanoid population called the Na'vi, they are very dangerous and hard to kill. With the help of Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and Dr. Max Patel (Dileep Rao) they combine avatar and human gene's so the humans are able to become and avatar to infiltrate their world and investigate their ways and life.<br/><br/>Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) tells Grace the only reason they are here is to get Onubtanium, which is a rock worth millions to the humans. Jake reports to Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) who gives him a mission to give him intell on the Na'vi and he will give him his real legs back since he is paralyzed from the waist down. When exploring Pandorum with the help of Grace and Norm Spellman (Joel Moore) who has been studying the Na'vi, Jake is chased by a creature leaving him stranded in the woods. With creature trying to attack him he is saved by a beautiful Na'vi girl named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) who discovers he is graced by the Aiwa which is the Na'vi's god. Neytiri then takes Jake to her parents Moat (CCH Pounder) and Eytukan (Wes Studi) to tell them what she has seen from Aiwa. Neytiri is then asked to show the ways of the Na'vi to Jake and if he passes he is one of them. Jake discovers he has a stronger relationship with the Na'vi than the real world he lives in now.<br/><br/>The graphics and the CGI in this movie were amazing and to see why this masterpiece took so long makes sense, because James Cameron did not have the kind of technology he did back then when he had the whole idea at hand. Everything comes together with great music and James Horner does a spectacular job in that part of making the scenes come to life with the right music for each situation throughout the film. Other music he has composed were from big movies such as A Beautiful Mind, Braveheart, Apocalypto, Troy, The New World, The Perfect Storm, Aliens, and most known for the music in Titanic. Hoping this movie wins some Golden Globe awards, because by far this was the most fantastic film I have seen this year. Along with what I have said the main actors Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and Stephen Lang all giving great performances worth winning any award in my book. Looking forward on seeing more work from them, this movie brings your feelings a boost and will give you feel good feelings if not an aching body from sitting through the whole movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron sure is a brilliant filmmaker. Most of his films have been memorable not just as fun stories, but also as great examples of experimental cinematography. Avatar is one such film.<br/><br/>Having spent ten years in film hiatus after Titanic, James Cameron returns to the big screen set to change Hollywood. And sure, technically, the film is surprising. The visuals look more like a Blu-ray DVD than traditional 24 frames per second film. Unfortunately, it is not the peak in cinematography it's been hyped to be.<br/><br/>For starters, the script is rather formulaic, and not just similar to other films like Dances with Wolves or Pocahontas. Several elements are taken directly from previous James Cameron works. The use of gigantic android vehicles is clearly drawn from Aliens (and also from The Matrix Revolutions). Some script resources are straight from Titanic, particularly an intermission where the main characters have sex.<br/><br/>The whole production details about creating a whole new culture make Cameron seem like a brilliant storyteller, but in reality, these type of things are done every time in other Sci-Fi and/or Fantasy productions.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, the story is not original.<br/><br/>The performances are not as important as the visuals here, but Cameron does know how to avoid the special effects from detracting the cast. Despite Sam Wothington and Zoe Saldanha's talents in acting, they're rather wasted when they're in CGI and in Na'Vi form. Sigourney Weaver and Giovanni Ribisi work perfectly. The rest of the cast does a great job.<br/><br/>There's an interesting parallel with the production and the score by James Horner. No matter how you look at it, this just isn't going to be another Titanic. Musically, it's not a breakthrough, since previous themes and constructs are from other scores, including surprising though pleasant portions of Apocalypto, and the ever so present \"danger theme\", which nearly ruins the \"War\" track. Add to this a pop song performed by Leona Lewis at the end (an irritating Horner tradition ever since Titanic), and you'll have a testament of elements that are placed to make the soundtrack work, but you've already heard them in better places.<br/><br/>The special effects are top notch, making such complex shots and sequences look realistic and compelling. The technical aspect of the film is the real champion for it's Oscar potential, with the 3D cameras, which are officially an invention by Cameron, doing an exemplary job. However, despite the versatile effects of shooting CGI and live action simultaneously, the Na'Vi still look fake. It's rather unfortunate that the spectacular landscapes are more realistically rendered than the moving inhabitants of this world of Pandora. The work done is not a cornerstone, but it sure is a good precursor of a new age in technical innovations.<br/><br/>Cameron made a huge fuss when releasing his Avatar, but, honestly, he doesn't have the right. The title dispute over The Last Airbender seems unfair, since the former was an already established franchise and Cameron's ego wouldn't let him let his pet project be altered in any way. The project wasn't that worthy of attention.<br/><br/>As it is with the director, it's his movie, and it is fun and technically groundbreaking, but it's not a masterpiece. It's a great way to close the decade, but it's also a sign of better things yet to come.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is a Sci Fiction Film that takes some aspects of The Matrix(1999). The common aspects are that in both the movies mind plays the game,the machines that are used for fighting purposes are almost similar to those in The Matrix. Now for the theme where the creature has to be controlled(it reminds me of the Man-&gt;Beast relation in The Golden Compass. Even The storyline has some elements of The Matrix like 1.In The Matrix Oracle Determines whether he is the ONE or not, here it is Moat who determines his fate. 2. In The Matrix Morpheus and Trinity Believes in Neo while here it is Neytiri. 3. In The Matrix Neo is brought to save the planet from destruction,the same happens here with Jake. The Storyline was also predictive.<br/><br/>Even the name of the film refers to Hindu Mythological Term.In Hinduism, Avatar or Avatara, refers to a deliberate descent of a deity from heaven to earth, and is mostly translated into English as \"incarnation\", but more accurately as \"appearance\" or \"manifestation\", as it corresponds more closely to the view of Docetism in Christian theology, as distinct from the idea of incarnation in mainstream Christology and its implication of God 'in the flesh Even though James Cameron got the idea's from these movies, he has setup the film in such a way that the people watching will go fanatic. The animation sequences along with the special effects create a dynamic environment for the viewers. <br/><br/>I watched Avatar in 3D and it brought life to the cinema.This experience can only be felt. Also Huge Congrats to James Cameron for not letting us down after the Movie Titanic(1997). I always used to check with IMDb of the Legendary Directors and always wondered why he didn't do T3&amp;T4(except for 1 or more episodes of Sarah Connor Chronicles). <br/><br/>In Short-&gt; This film is breathtaking,162 min non stop animation film that makes you believe that you too are into this world.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Its basically the visuals. I could see why this film took 12 years to make. The plot is relatively simple. Its like the good conquistador and the natives just before the rest of the Spanish arrive and rape, pillage, plunder, except the natives are blue not brown and the Spanish are Earthlings. The visual effects are crazy son! Its an entirely lifelike world created in a desktop. There's a detailed explanation to every fictitious wildlife. However watching this you realize that the imagination is only limited to whatever we see. Everything in the film comes from something we have seen before. Native tribes, tigers, rhinos, lemurs, horses, wolves and giant birds. 12 years of work went into it so the hype didn't fail. One thing. This movie is called Avatar, a word from Hindu mythology, did it have anything to do with it? Possibly, because there were BLUE PEOPLE in the movie!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I have to admit that this was the One Film that I went in expecting alot. I usually don't do that, but firstly, it's a James Cameron movie, and two, it was the new tech at that time. So something had to hit home. It turned out to have good acting and a completely new setting for the story. CGI was exceptional and the story worked out. I like the end where he finally caught the predator bird - that was a lead to the finale.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron never fails to make a beautiful piece of work .Avatar really is a sight for the eyes the scenery is so beautiful and the story is enchanting and really gripping. A must watch for all ages this film has something for everyone in it Sigourney Weaver plays a brilliant character who you instantly like. The film really is just a amazing film, certain scenes even bring tears to your eyes. I saw this film in 3D and it didn't even make it better this film 3D or not is brilliant. Overall I believe everyone should watch it because really does deserve all the awards It has won, no one will be disappointed! Watch it !</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is a look-at-the-pretty-scenery movie, it tries to distract you with pretty scenery and amazing CG creatures, while in the meantime you might not even notice the movie's political message that will likely take you out of the experience if you happen to get bored from the CG half- way through and actually start paying attention to what the characters are implying.<br/><br/>Let's brake down to what I dislike, considering it's 80% RT count with so many five-star reviews, I have to ask did everyone set the bar lower for the term \"best movies of the year\".<br/><br/>In order for a movie to even begin to qualify as the best movie of 2009,you need a strong story, you need memorable characters and you need good twists.<br/><br/>Avatar has none of the above.<br/><br/>Starting with it's main hero, Jake Sully, played by an obviously bored Sam Worthington, whose animated Avatar actually has more charisma than his real life counterpart. <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver's character is fun, but pointless, Michelle Rodriguez does not play a bad girl, except for the latter part of the film where she stands up to Quarricth and has one of the most brainless death scenes I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Shame we never get to see Zõe Saldanha, as she is quite attractive, but her Na'vi character is that first quite smart(she does have one great dramatic scene) but her character later loses her charisma.<br/><br/>Quarritch is a forgettable villain and well as the head of the RDA who is a jerk and greedy for no apparent reason other than the script demands him to be so.<br/><br/>The Na'vi are for the most part a mix of the most clichéd aspects of the noble warrior, a common myth that has no ounce of truth to it anywhere but in popular culture.<br/><br/>And let's talk about the plot, for a plot this derivative and look while I understand that there have been homages and more shameless rip-off than Avatar and that it's really not a big deal, but for Cameron to hype his script as 14 years in the making, he's not being honest.<br/><br/>The movie offers very little surprises and for it's derivative nature it plays it very safe. TDK, as an example again, takes the superhero clichés behind the tool-shed and shoots it right between the eyes. Avatar does nothing of the sort.<br/><br/>Instead, it plays on more modern themes, such as environmentalism, hence almost spoofing Ferngully: The Last Rainforest and also seems to say something about the military and not in the most flattering way, as Quarritch arrives on the scene to get the Na'vi to leave and with his army tries blows up the Na'vi's home in a scene that pretty much mimmicks the September the 11th attacks. Except that in the context of the film, it's greedy white military/mercenaries that commit such an atrocity against foreign natives in order to steal their wealth.<br/><br/>And that's when you see the movie's true heart of darkness, when it parallels the mindset of \"blood for oil\". It's scary, I know...<br/><br/>Avatar is basically a gross revisionism and reinterpretation of political zeitgeist of the past 8 years.<br/><br/>I was both shocked and rolling my eyes during that climactic scene. But with villains this basic and one note, how could you not feel for the Na'vi?<br/><br/>At that point, all the Na'vi, including Neyfitri are angry because at Jakesully(that how they call him), because he betrayed and they have every right to be so. But what does our hero do? Do something that no Na'vi, considering the context of the film even thought, but Jake Sully who has been a Na'vi for roughly 3 months, by catching a mythical bird that like I said before, no Na'vi ever remembered and presto, Nefitiry already forgives him and he becomes a leader to them, just like that.<br/><br/>It gets even more idiotic that the same Na'vi who pray to their trees when the inevitable showdown looms and Ewya does nothing except when Jake Sully uses his naturally grown USB port and asks for Eywa to help.<br/><br/>And so the final showdown between Quarritch, his men and the united Na'vi tribes begin. As things look bleak for the Na'vi, who instead of just marching right into the line of fire, since they are a warrior tribe, Ewya decides to intervene, making animals and general wildlife fight the invaders, all thanks to Jake Sully, of course, Eywa could have been much nicer to it's people if she had decided to act before most of the Na'vi had already been shot. What a beatch, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Avatar is just not as good as many critics will have you believe.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">After gathering my thoughts, I will preface this by saying this is a difficult film to review. Specifically, while there were some things I liked about the movie, there are other things I found off-putting.<br/><br/>First, let's highlight the strengths. Technically, this was a beautiful film to watch. To get a good experience, I would definitely recommend this in 3D rather than 2D. The imagination put into the world, coupled with the computer imagery, are definitely gripping. The development of the alien species and planet of Pandora was also very remarkable, from language to culture. The special effects are definitely a step towards making computer imagery more lifelike than ever (however, I will stop short of saying \"like nothing you'll ever see...more later). Second, Sam Worthington is the anchor of this movie; very charismatic, but does punctuate his performance with some subtleties that make him more human than others. Third, the sci-fi technology is believable, in the vein of the 2 \"Alien\" movies.<br/><br/>That being said, let's hit the weaknesses. First and foremost, the story was almost a complete rip of \"Dances with Wolves\", except in space. Very off-putting, as I think for the time and effort that was put into the film and development of the aliens, I was expecting something more original. Come to think of it, it reminded me of another popcorn movie, Independence Day, but took itself more seriously. Special effects are nice, but if a story is lacking, it can make the experience tedious. Second, when considering the other performances apart from Worthington's (and I include alien ones), they were relatively flat or overacted. Even poor Sigourney Weaver, an actress I really like on the whole, was underutilised in her role. Third, I previously stressed that the movie had to be seen in 3D; I say this because prior to going into this film, I had seen previews, and was not very convinced of the ground-breaking effects. The 3D experience definitely enhances the viewing experience (though I wouldn't say it's a roller-coaster ride), but I could easily say if I had seen it in 2D, my review may have been lower. Finally, like I previously said, the effects were a step above computer imagery as we have seen it. But would I say it had the same gripping experience of first seeing \"Star Wars\", or the T-1000 of \"Terminator 2\", or even the computer generated scenery of \"Phantom Menace\" (which I gave a similar rating for based on story)? Definitely not.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would still recommend watching the movie, with some conditions. First, it must be seen in 3D (IMAX if possible); 2D would only spoil the experience (would definiely not rent it until 3D TV comes out). Second, story expectations should be low (like going to see an IMAX museum film--go for the scenery, discard the story). In the end, it reminded me of my experience listening to Sgt. Pepper; I appreciate the historical technical advances it made, and even like parts of the album, but would still put other albums well above it from a satisfaction standpoint.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Like the original 1977 \"Star Wars,\" this film at last raises the bar in terms of crafting a breathtakingly beautiful and mesmerizing alien world and its creatures. I predict there will be several copycat films that try to cash in on the Avatar \"look,\" and the film certainly will have a cult following. Though the movie is over two hours long, it presents such a rich tapestry and lively pace it flows by quickly. <br/><br/>The film is so visually overwhelming that the storyline became secondary to me. No other sci-fi film in memory has so convincingly woven together and entire alien biosphere and pre-technological civilization. When I saw the blue \"Smurfs-on- steroid\" aliens in the trailers, I was afraid this would be a sappy tale. It is anything but. <br/><br/>Many elements from Cameron's earlier films are obvious. Sigourney Weaver looks and acts like she just shipped out after her adventure in the movie \"Aliens.\" The bioluminescent creatures of the moon Pandora are reminiscent of the aliens in \"The Abyss.\" The fighter ships come straight from \"Terminator.\" Cameron also heavily borrows designs from the \"Dinotopia\" fantasy book series.<br/><br/>What I do find tiring is the heavy-handed environmentalism message that seems a prerequisite for otherworld fantasy films today. There is even a veiled allusion to the Bible's Tree of Life. Apparently the moon Pandora is a living Garden of Eden. That is, until those greedy, warlike, and arrogant humans come along. <br/><br/>This is where the story gets weak and horribly contrived. The moon has some magnetic superconducting element not found anywhere else in the galaxy. And, the natives of Pandora just happen to be living on top of it. Talk about location, location, location.<br/><br/>Never mind that the universe is collectively made of exactly the same bricks and mortar found in the periodic table of the elements. Or, that transporting an exotic element to Earth across interstellar space would be ridiculously expensive. It would be vastly cheaper to synthesize it on Earth.<br/><br/>The film draws obvious parallels to the decimation of Native Americans by the New World colonists. The military bad guy's are straight out of Cameron's \"The Abyss.\" Apparently humans are so evil they not only would strip mine a planet but also decimate its inhabitants. <br/><br/>In reality our scientists would always have the upper hand in such a discovery simply because Pandorans don't vote for Congressmen. A moon like this would be just an astrobiology curiosity. It's totally implausible that any private corporation would have the resources to mount an interstellar gold rush.<br/><br/>These story shortcomings aside, \"Avatar\" is still a powerfully engaging and memorable film. It's a long-awaited break from much less imaginative and utterly moronic story lines in most contemporary sci-fi films, such as \"District 9\" and \"2012.\"</div>,\n",

It did more than set me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>I found myself alternately laughing, crying, cheering, and even shaking in anticipation with each new moment in the movie.<br/><br/>I do have to say that it did take about a half hour or so to get into but after that, the world just disappeared around me.<br/><br/>There are some definite societal overtones to this movie. It quickly became apparent that this was a social statement about what happened to the native Americans when the Europeans arrived on the continent. But its a statement that honestly cannot be overdone, as its happened to other society's too.<br/><br/>The lesson is to learn from history, something that few seem to have done. If we cannot learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it, even if its to an alien race over a century in the future.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, the story was still captivating.<br/><br/>And rather than taking away from the movie, I found the CGI simply adding to it.<br/><br/>It was so real. There are times I caught myself flinching as a stray ash or leaf moved through the image. Like I could reach out and touch what I was seeing.<br/><br/>Simply and utterly incredible.<br/><br/>James Cameron truly has a masterpiece unlike any I've ever seen. I only hope he gets his due at the awards shows this year, but somehow I doubt it. The awards shows never give it to anyone that actually deserves it when they actually deserve it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">One of the most amazing movies I have ever seen in my life.Before I went and saw Avatar I asked people what they thought about it and they said\" the plot wasn't very good but the imagery is out of this world.You will love this movie\".I went and saw this movie at the movies and I was so amazed by the imagery that I was so speechless.I forgot about every problem I had for the almost 3 hours I spent in the theater and I couldn't get many of the images out of my mind for weeks.<br/><br/>Avatar is truly James Cameron's magnum opus.It is without the doubt best movie that he has directed.I cannot have a word to describe this movie but I will put it into 2 words \"Absolutely Incredible\".This is the most stunning piece of work I have seen in a movie.Although the plot was not great, the movies images made up for the plot by a huge mile.The greatest 3D movie ever.I am not surprised this movie has grossed 2.7 billion at the box office.This is a movie you have to see at the cinema.<br/><br/>10/10 for a genius movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Just Watched The long awaited James Cameron's AVATAR. And I must say It was worth a wait. Though James Cameron Subjects Only Aliens or Titanic, But he portrays them Beautifully and Professionally. Titanic, which created History was considered his finest work but I must Disagree. All of his work can't be compared and Equally good. And A lot of you guys will agree with me that Titanic is way Under-rated.<br/><br/>Well lets forget Titanic now, Come to Avatar.Its Just a well made, Visually stunning movie which is perfect in most respects.<br/><br/>The Best Part of the movie is The Visuals, Graphics and Cinematography. No other Film could reach this much Excellence (Nor the Budget.) Original Score Is sweet but not Titanic good.(I am sure it will get Oscar Nod.) Sound mixing, Sound Editing and Film Editing is As Good As It Gets.<br/><br/>Direction is Fine and Steady throughout the Film.<br/><br/>Screenplay(story is traffic)is O.k. Its quiet understandable (since the movie deals with Sci-Fi and Fantasy it explains the movie 90%) but it is Predictable as well.In other words I didn't Like the screenplay Much.Its my only criticism Overall Its a Very Well Made Film in all respects.<br/><br/>My Rating 9.5/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Just the Colors and Beautiful scenes will leave your mouth open.This movie is one of my all time greats as the story is wonderful and cinematography is rich with once again Beautiful scenes and COLOR!. Go and see this one as you won't regret it! I had to also by this in Blu-Ray as that is the best way to see this awesome movie! I don't know why they make you write 10 lines on IMDb, I think 5 lines is sufficient for a review especially when you don't want to contain any spoilers. I think they want 10 lines to discourage anyone from writing comments that are useless or just wanting to spam. Anyhow this movie is a MUST BUY! BUY THIS MOVIE AND WATCH IN BLU-RAY HD TV!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar makes the best out of CGI in this live-action, emotional, putting you on the edge of your seat film of extraordinary proportions.<br/><br/>Just like James Cameron has done in the past he has brought something new to cinema. He has directed some of the most influential and amazing films of the last twenty years some examples being The Terminator and Titanic. Avatar has now come to take it's place in such high rankings.<br/><br/>Watching Avatar is like being on a roller-coaster ride that you just do not want to get off of. When you see it you'll know what I'm talking about. With all of the action, sorrow, romance, and the fight to just be there is absolutely no way that you can't enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Avatar tells the story about a man named Jake that lost his legs while on duty in the military. Now he travels to the world Pandora on a mission that could help him get his legs back. He is on a mining world where what they are digging up is worth a lot of money. However, the natives of Pandora are called the Na'vi and their home is on the site of where they're trying to mine and that is where Jake comes in. His mission was to get them to relocate but in time that starts to change. He uses an avatar (a body that looks like him and Na'vi as well) he uses this body to communicate with the Navi. While he is under their care he falls for the princess of the Na'vi. As he feels more at home with them the sooner he realizes that he must make a choice to side with the humans or the Na'vi and find his true place in life.<br/><br/>Avatar is probably the most amazing film of not just the year but the decade. This is a film that you would love to see over and over again.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">First of all I am a great fan of James Cameron, and I went to see this movie with great expectation. But very sorry to say that, what I got was a total pathetic version of mediocre VFX-LOVE-DRAMA-STRUGGLE movie.<br/><br/>When I am writing this comment, all those great memories coming into my mind, that first Script Treatment for Avatar I read from the Internet years ago. All those images and there happenings in the script envisioned, went totally upside down when it was finally filmed.<br/><br/>Set in the future 2154 the story starts with a man named Jake Sully a paraplegic former marine, who lost his twin brother and arrives on planet/moon Pandora to replace his brother's assignment in the Avatar program. What is an Avatar? Basically the term taken from Hindu Religion which means incarnation of one of the Hindu Gods taking a flesh form. But in the movie it stands for injecting a human's intelligence into another remotely located biological body. <br/><br/>IE, On Pandora the superior life forms (much like humans) are called Na'vis very tall, lean, blue skinned, big eyed creatures with tails. Since humans cannot breathe Pandora's atmosphere, scientists have created human-na'vi hybrid bodies called Avatars. So they may easily interact with the na'vi and na'vi address them as Dream-walkers.Things went wrong when Jake took his Avatar form in a much more emotional level.<br/><br/>As a VFX student/artist myself, yes Cameron done a great work. It's the first time the Notorious \"Uncanny Valley\" effect (A viewer intelligence to find unrealistic human characteristics in a CGI Object)failed in the big Screen. The VFX characters never looked so realistic or more precisely looked \"PEOPLE in BLUE RUBBER MASK\". Total achievement in Visual Effects standard point, the Sound editing, Animation, perfect in all sense. Even tough, personally I think the main character design of Na'vi's looked pathetic, especially that blue color, but hey it's Cameron's favorite color tone.<br/><br/>But the problem in the Avatar is the whole story, JC worked so much in this project for years, but he lost in polishing it, mainly because he concentrated his energy on the VFX side and it can be seen in the whole picture. The major movements in the movie made me Deja Vu, especially that romantic pairs Forest scenes directly taken from Major Walt Disney Animated movies like TARZAN, SPIRIT STALLION OF THE CIMARRON and exactly from FERNGULLY THE LAST RAINFOREST.<br/><br/>And let face it, Cameron is not good at Sissy girly melodrama stuffs so we find mediocre weak dialog, awkward love scenes through out the movie, and I can understand that he's a SCIFI LEGEND not a Woody Allen! ( In Terminator he got help from his uncredited co-writer William Wisher for Sarah Conner's dialog.) If he had left off the romantic angle the movie could have been much better, or may be he just added to make it more DRAMATIC. But the whole story suffered a \"WALT Disney Taste\" because of that.<br/><br/>Also the music by James Horner was annoying especially in the humor scenes, it sounded stupid and lame. Cameron should choose some one with more integrity and soul like Hans Zimmmer or James Howard Newton. The war cue and the main theme is so forgettable, he should have given his dream project to his usual collaborator Brad Fiedel.<br/><br/>And the cast assembled for this movie was so bad especially the main lead actor Sam Worthington with his dumb voice accent and screen presence I wish to crush my 3D glass. Cameron should give chances to black actors. Anything came good was from Giovanni Ribisi as the aggressive corporate administrator with less screen time. And also Zoe Saldana was interesting with the \"ACTOR DRIVEN PERFORMANCE\", also must give credits to the animators and VFX crew. <br/><br/>But the most threatening shot I found in this VFX Glowed movie was Sam Worthington realistic poliomyelitis legs done in CGI/Prosthetic practical FX. The Less FX is Much enough, Cameron should know that Rule and should never go to the roots of George Lucas. And I must say the whole Three D experience was not good as I expected, I should have went for the normal theater, this one hurt my eyes and enjoyment.<br/><br/>All in all this is not the Avatar I anticipated, I imagined a far more a intriguing vision from the Terminator Director. What I got was a James Cameron's Mockery of Walt Disney movies. You will enjoy it if you are new to Hollywood Epics, but as an experienced movie watcher I give this movie 3 out of 10. <br/><br/>Only because 1) James Cameron directed THE ABYSS! 2) James Cameron directed TERMINATOR!! 3) James Cameron directed TITANIC!!!<br/><br/>Avatar = Walt Disney Movies on Steroids.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron (Aliens Terminator 1 &amp; 2 Abyss Titanic). Avatar is the most expensive &amp; technically ambitious film ever made. I guess I am the last person to see Avatar. I sometimes hate living in a rural area &amp; only getting to see movies very late &amp; only on DVD. I saw Terry Gilliams Dr Parnassus this weekend &amp; was very impressed with its brilliant visuals. I guess Avatar is now the mother of all big screen epic fantasy science fiction digital effects movies. I especially like the movie as it is really a technical breakthrough for digital CGI &amp; is politically motivated by its anti war &amp; green environmental messages. It is an extraordinary film. I hope I get to see the 3D before it disappears. I will have to drive 3 ½ to 7 hours to see in 3 D &amp;/or IMAX. (each direction) Today 05/31/10 The film is 2 hours 41 minutes which is long but the film is so engrossing the time passes quickly. It's hard to believe he spent almost 10 years making this film. Plot wise: In the future, Jake, a paraplegic war veteran, is brought to another planet, Pandora, which is inhabited by the Na'vi, a humanoid race with their own language &amp; culture. Those from Earth find themselves at odds with each other &amp; the local culture. The film's plot gives us Men invaders (from earth?) against a forest-dwelling alien race with a strong anti-conquest---back-to-nature type theme. I think this film does not have as much or as strong universal appeal as Titanic but close (for a science fictions film) It is really not well explained why Earthlings—military &amp; armed forces, need to travel light years away to Pandora to mine a precious mineral that will help rescue the planet earth from ecological disaster. Plot wise the film is stereotypical evil-white-empire against the green inner serenity seeking-native. Though a wonderful film it was kind of clichéd to me. Worthington Lang &amp; Weaver are all great in their roles. Things on the net state Worthington was semi living in his car while auditioning!!.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'm a sucker for beautiful special effects and epic action movies, so I found Avatar to be a brilliant movie. I watched Avatar in 3d at the cinema and I was amazed by the amount of work that has been put in to this movie. I liked the tragic story and the characters, I do not have any complaints about this movie.<br/><br/>James Cameron has spent the last many years to develop this movie and the new 3d technology, he has succeeded well in my opinion. Avatar takes place in the far future where human kind is interfering with the natives on the planet Pandora. Because the natives want to protect their land and the humans want to interfere and take over the land, a great struggle begins.<br/><br/>I'm definitely going to purchase this movie on BluRay in the nearest future.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Some have said here that Avatar has re-defined what movies are - that it even defines a whole new genre. Personally I enjoyed the experience very much and would recommend everyone go see it. But it certainly wasn't flawless, and it's flaws (for me) actually helped reaffirm what good films are all about.<br/><br/>Films tell stories. Good films do so efficiently, rationally, while engaging us on an emotional level. They use visual and sound stimulus to do this - but these are means to an end, not the end itself.<br/><br/>Avatar scores very moderately as a film. The proportion of production individuals tasked with the 'ends' (i.e. story/ script) versus the 'means' (i.e CGI) are telling. The plot logic crumbles with the lightest of analytical touches, and the overall eco-message is so crassly delivered that you even wonder whether this is a tremendously subtle counter-strike paid for by a mining cartel. With the exception of the Australians, no one has ever been this in-sensitive to indigenous rights.<br/><br/>However, what the box office records for Avatar show is that humans remain interested in a 'damn good spectacle' - and the visual achievement of Avatar is unparalleled.<br/><br/>It's a terrible film - but go SEE it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Mesmerizing is the best way I can describe this movie. The visuals take you to \"that place,\" that place you go when you are truly transformed and have an out-of-body experience when watching a movie--just what the great movies do to its viewers.<br/><br/>I was not one who was overly-anxious to see this film, didn't really care either way. I'm glad though I did agree to go, it pretty much lived up to the hype. I wouldn't give it an 8.8 like its score now on IMDb, I think that's a little high given the relative simplicity of the plot, but it was really a very well made film and as you watched it, you felt like you were in the hands of professionals, movie-making experts.<br/><br/>One word of advice if you haven't seen it. This movie is very political, the political angle is not even subtle. So if you have strong leanings one way or the other, be prepared to either be turned off or validated by the obvious political slant of the makers of this film.<br/><br/>But do go see it, it's worth the money. One of the few times a movie (at least almost) lives up to the hype, which is much more than I can say about the next recent release I'm about to review, \"Up in the Air.\" Don't even get me started on over-hype!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Many people have already said that this film is the same story as such films as Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai and by no means does this fact alone make this film lesser. The main issue I had with this film is how frustratingly and brutally heavy handed the themes are and the way the villains are written. I say frustrating because there could be some interesting commentary and historical callbacks to European colonialism (especially that of the East India Company in India) but it's all ruined by the writing. The villains, especially, constantly reassure the audience that they are completely unlikable and have no redeeming qualities to them whatsoever. It's a lot like what happened with Titanic except on steroids. You have a greedy, villain of the week, Saturday morning cartoon, mustache twirling, capitalist guy who only cares about money and a meat head military colonel who likes to carpet bomb now and ask questions later- so to speak. There are tons of references to European colonization in India, references to the Opium Wars and even the Vietnam War, but all of those potential callbacks go totally unexplored- and dare I say that is the case because it's completely by accident- in favor of pushing a much broader and watered down theme that technologically advanced societies are inherently bad and tribal, naturalistic societies are objectively superior. Every time I detected a subtle callback to history, the film comes around and hits me with its actual theme and I couldn't help but to feel like I was being spoon fed this and having my hand held through the entire 160 minute ordeal. Avatar could have ended up being more than what it is if it was allowed to speak for itself rather than have the writer constantly come out and tell you during almost every scene what it is about. Sometimes less is more, is all I'm trying to say.<br/><br/>Where this film excels is in two categories: The visual effects and the action sequences.<br/><br/>This film was technologically cutting-edge back when it came out, and after being around for a decade it has managed to age quite well. Despite so much of it being digitally created, it does not have that aged-like-milk visual aspect to it that a film like this runs the risk of falling into. There are some CG elements that look a bit dated but most of those are background elements that most probably wouldn't even notice. It's quite amazing how impressive this film is in the visual effects department and the unfathomable amount of work it must have taken to make it appear this way continues to pay off.<br/><br/>The action sequences in this film are also great. The buildup to the final battle was great and when the final battle itself commences it is incredibly thrilling in the same way a final battle in an Avengers film would be. It also helps that, despite the disappointing writing for the villains, the protagonists are written well-enough to have the necessary emotional investment to actually care about the outcome.<br/><br/>This film is complicated in ways that it definitely didn't mean to be, nor wanted to be. This film had a message that ironically went against what this film gets so much praise for. Avatar appeals to nature a lot and makes its point extra clear by demonizing technology and yet this film was sold on the way it pushed technology further and was going to usher in the era of 3D movies for real, this time. A film sold on its technology uses it to say how bad technology is, and is yet celebrated for both somehow? Maybe others got more out of this film than I did, but I couldn't help but to come out of it feeling underwhelmed. It keeps saying that it's more than it is but every time it hammers that in, the less I believe it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Too much using of blue color was somewhat annoying in this movie and sounded so childish but the content behind the story is so great. It wants to teach us how to respect different worlds no matter how much they are different but still they've their own goals, dreams and desires.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The 3d special effects are a marvel that will encapsulate you inside the cockpit of a futuristic helicopter, give you the point of view of a marine embarking on a new world and completely immerse you in a foreign planet. The 3D aspect makes the movie worth seeing, however the much anticipated and hyped otherworldly experience is safely kept on our own world. <br/><br/>The environment is a richly lush jungle where some of the plants do mildly quirky things. The creatures are derivatives of dinosaurs or horses or other earth bound animals. The attractive \"aliens\" are tall humanoids that are safely exotic with light blue skin and cute tails. The alien's society easily mocks societies that we are familiar with. The imagination with such a project could have truly taken us to the outer-limits and that would be fascinating when paired with innovative 3D special effects instead we are still kept mostly earthbound. There is some imagination such as the natives interesting kinship to nature and the visually stunning, romantically glowing forest at night but the makers were relatively safe and too frightened to frighten us away. Alas, we still remain on Earth, despite the \"promise\" to take us to a new world. <br/><br/>The story could have really taken off to the furthest stretches of the imagination unfortunately few risks were taken in this department as well and we are presented with something very crowd pleasing and conventional. We've seen this predictable cookie cutter storyline in other movies and the lack of innovation will prevent this from being a classic. Simple cartoonish characters unrealistically and unbelievably portray humans in the future. Can I really suspend my belief that people in the future will choose to start a war and destroy an alien race over some mineral or will humans of the future rather get more of a reward of studying such a species? Audience will be forced to dumb-down their minds to the comic bookie state, take the movie for what it is and enjoy the spectacular special effects and new 3D technology. The movie was really about the 3D special effects which will generate an \"oh cool\" sentiment without distracting us from the story. Despite all this it is still an entertaining, more summery, popcorn, blockbuster.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">At last, three weeks after its original release date, I have managed to see Avatar. The hype for this movie was unbelievable as many claim that it is revolutionary and will change the future of film-making; while it is not yet clear exactly how much of an impact Avatar will have on the industry in the long-term, as entertainment and a theater experience, it is more than satisfactory.<br/><br/>Of course, the most prominent and talked-about element of the movie is its phenomenal special effects. For probably the first time in film history, a director has seamlessly integrated CGI, animation and live-action and particularly in 3D, the result is a fully immersing experience, the sensation that the viewer has been transported from the movie theater and into the fantastical world created by James Cameron and his crew. With an array of interesting creatures and vibrant, breathtaking landscapes, Pandora becomes alive on-screen and a sense of wonder and mystery lingers throughout the movie as the audience explores this fictional planet along with the characters.<br/><br/>However, no movie can truly be good without an engaging story and interesting characters worth rooting for (or against). Thankfully, though the plot is hardly the most creative or unpredictable one out there, Cameron, who wrote the screenplay in addition to directing, does an admirable job. At the core of the story is Jake Sully, an ex-Marine who is recruited to participate in an avatar program used for both corporate business ventures and scientific research. This character could easily have become a caricature - the ignorant outsider who turns into a martyr for the oppressed natives - but Sam Worthington imbues Jake with a sort of zeal and curious yet brash swagger that makes him human and, ultimately, a very sympathetic protagonist. Any other actor might have made Jake too bitter and cynical at the beginning of the film and, post-transformation, too self-righteous and altruistic. But Worthington takes a more subtle approach, using body language and minute changes in his facial expression to convey the thoughts and emotions of his character. He makes Jake's transformation believable and natural.<br/><br/>Although Sam Worthington gives the movie's most impressive performance, the rest of the cast provides strong support for him. Many roles, especially Sigourney Weaver's Dr. Grace Augustine and Stephen Lang's Colonel Miles Quaritch, present several opportunities for the actors to do a little scenery-chewing, but they all show a reasonable amount of restraint, allowing the focus to stay on Jake and whoever else is important to a given scene. Though one might think that the heavy use of motion-capture and the fact that, much of the time, the only characters on screen are ten-feet tall and blue would detract from the effectiveness of the performances, the personalities of the characters are in no way diminished or obscured.<br/><br/>The film's main flaw is its length, which clocks in at two hours and forty minutes. Some of the initial freshness is lost by the end, which mostly consists of elaborate battle sequences. It is not that there are extraneous scenes, but instead, a more effective solution would be to pick up the pacing towards the end and trim, rather than cut entire scenes out. In addition, some have criticized the movie for not having an entirely unique story, and their comments are, to a point, valid since the basic plot is something we've seen many times before in movies like Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai. Yet, somehow, all of this seems beside the point. One of Cameron's greatest strengths as a director has always been his ability to make movies that transcend clichés and that engage and entertain regardless of how often similar stories have been told.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, while Avatar is not my favorite movie of 2009, it was certainly an engrossing and even enriching experience. By inventing a whole new world and populating it with realistic, fascinating inhabitants, James Cameron has taken full advantage of the capabilities of film-making, weaving together a story that is simultaneously moving, thrilling and enchanting. More than anything, Avatar is a reminder of the marvels and beauty of life, as well as the horror and devastation of war.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">We didn't see this film until after it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture as well as many other awards. We stand by our prediction that Hurt Locker will earn the award for best picture. Avatar and director/writer/producer James Cameron deserve awards and acclaim for the technical accomplishments in the use of 3D, computer generated animation and special effects. The \"out of this world\" flying, at times gigantic, horse/dragon like creatures were very impressive although their continued presence for much of the movie was not our cup of tea. The appearance of the avatars as well as that of the people who were being visited or we should say the natives of the land that was being invaded was also quite creative. All their facial features were completely non-human as was the presence of their tail and many of their mannerisms, but yet their behavior was all too human. It was most of the humans who were engaging in the inhumane actions. While the plot was somewhat simple, familiar and predictable, it was the symbolism and important themes that raised the value of the film. One could not help but be reminded of the experience of the native Americans or the native inhabitants of so many other places that have been invaded by intruders seeking to plunder their land. There was a green theme with a spiritual love of nature. Also clear was the presence of strong, good women who possessed both strength of character and strength of purpose. Some of the scenes with helicopter like gun ships setting this very special countryside aflame with bright orange fire explosions with the background radio chatter of the invading forces were reminiscent of scenes from the Viet Nam War and perhaps some later day events. It is probably fair to say that this is an anti-war film. Some might say it is anti-American and others might feel it is not a fair depiction of the real good guys. It certainly is cutting edge and may be the beginning of a new genre.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I have to admit, I liked Avatar regardless of my perspectives about mainstream productions. It was a great adventure with mixed-stories borrowed from other fables, war movies, but in a visual which is really magical, yet I'm not fond of green-box or any similar things, even if it was basically relying on it in a big picture (So, actually it's more an animation movie then a real-actor motion picture (Like Star wars nowadays).)<br/><br/>It's a Visual Movie, with great atmosphere, magical environmental constructions, so there is nothing which would be problem for our eyes (maybe just the not so great contrast between real humans and fantasy surroundings)<br/><br/>The Music fitted to the movie, yet it had similar melodies to Apocalypto, and as I was looking for the composer's name, I knew that it's going to be James Horner, 'coz it would be absurd if other composer would steal scores from another great motion pictures(Apocalypto, Troy, Zorro), but it was alright.<br/><br/>The Story is based on a classical war-love pattern, which we have seen many-many times in other, lower budget movies, but the whole movie is like a big mix-up with Pocahontas, The Last of the Mohicans, Titanic, Apocalypto, Star Wars, war movies. So, yeah, it's not original, but again, it's a Visual Movie for me, and on that field it's really ... bitchin'.<br/><br/>Overall: The presentation is tremendously magical, yet it lacks originality in story background it's a great visual adventure with fascinating fable atmosphere, which we'll never forget.<br/><br/>It's like the ol' good Fables in a wider, newer, more modern form...<br/><br/>7/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Yes, the CGI are definitively first class, if you like them as an end in itself...<br/><br/>But for me they aren't...<br/><br/>Well, the story background is interesting, confronting the power of force and weapons, and the will of freedom and self respect.<br/><br/>Since I prefer both last ones, some aspect of this movie pleased me a lot.<br/><br/>But nevertheless I think Cameron did it as a pretext to show us a war-movie.<br/><br/>Fighting scenes are never so much of my taste, as long as they represent quiet well what does exist in the real world.<br/><br/>Of course, many graphical aspects of Avatar are beautifully composed and imagined.<br/><br/>Not to mention this would be missing the positive aspect of it.<br/><br/>I don't think, as I read in some comments, this movie is a milestone in art, in any ways, Nope !<br/><br/>It is a milestone yes, but just for the 3D effects, and that's just not enough for me...<br/><br/>Cameron is an excellent money and movie maker, no doubt of it... And as I undoubtedly believe too, it eventually will crash most box-offices records : money, audience, and so on...<br/><br/>Away these business things, for me, something with a high spirit is missing !<br/><br/>OK ! you would say the hero did help to win a war, obviously it seems so...<br/><br/>But to me, win a war is a kind of defeat, as long as you are the one to have started that war.<br/><br/>It means, you have basically not respected someone's else freedom and way of life.<br/><br/>Somehow, the analogy with what main world superpowers do on our Earth jump at our faces (at least mine :-), but I guess, as most people don't analyze things that way, they just will keep on mind how fantastic a Hero could defeat the bad ones, who have powerful weapons.<br/><br/>Generally I like the Hero concept !<br/><br/>But remember the Hero (was not yet one !), in this movie, basically accept to cheat and fake for a good while, then realize, how wrong he is...<br/><br/>For finally shifting to self-respect and freedom, at last.<br/><br/>Too bad, unfortunately it's too late, and therefore destruction is on its way.<br/><br/>So, at the end, things turn out to be normal ; The bad is defeated and the Wise have win.<br/><br/>Coming back to the beginning of my comment, all in all : an excuse to CGI and to a war-movie, just not enough :-)<br/><br/>a film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet Orson Welles</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar was better than I expected. The trailers and previews don't do this movie justice. The real strength of this film is its visuals, which ordinary TVs can't come close to reproducing. The visuals are revolutionary and would make this movie worth watching alone.<br/><br/>Its main weakness is the storyline. It's not awful, just pretty standard. There is no chance the screenplay is going to win any prizes. But it's no worse than 75% of movies and better than many, and there are one or two serious messages in the movie, such as the way Capitalism ruthlessly exploits natural resources.<br/><br/>If the storyline matched the imagery, this movie would the best film ever. The 3D effects and special effects and imagery in this film are truly amazing. Don't even consider the 2D version.<br/><br/>Apart from the plot, there are other weaknesses. The back story (why they chose the main character, who is a paraplegic) is ridiculous (in fact, the whole disabled marine storyline is unnecessary), some of the acting is wooden (Sigourney Weaver looks like she is going through the motions), and it's too long (2½ hours).<br/><br/>Apart from the visuals, there are other strengths. The sci-fi is sound (including the concept of an avatar), Pandora (the alien planet) is superbly rendered, some of the acting is good (Zoe Saldana), and the movie doesn't feel like it's 2½ hours long.<br/><br/>A milestone in movie history due to the visuals. In spite of this, I gave it 8/10 because of its routine storyline and ordinary acting. But not one to miss.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's long awaited return to cinema! His first feature film since Titanic. Cameron has always been a filmmaker who brings something new, so of course the hype was really high for his next film. And information of what Avatar was going to be just kept increasing everyone's anticipation for it. This looked like something different. Cameron has long been a favourite filmmaker for me. Terminator 1 &amp; 2 are definitely on my list of best movies ever. So did it live up? Well Avatar is a great movie. It is not an amazing one. The expression style over substance has been used many times and by me before but Avatar is exactly that. Cameron ones again takes the special effects to new heights and also reintroduced 3D to cinema. Technically the visuals are a masterpiece one could say. Also the design and creativity of the world and creatures is great. Not on Star Wars like levels but Avatar looks pretty much flawless. The whole movie has this very epic theme to it. The action is also great as should be expected. It's not as mind-blowing as his Terminator movies or as intense as Aliens or as ridiculously (in an entertaining way) as in True Lies. But Avatar is better than most released at the same time. However, it is underneath this brilliant surface that the flaws are. The story is Avatars weakest part. It totally lacks in originality. It borrows heavily from many different sources. I feel that even if one has not seen a lot of movies Avatar is unfortunately very predictable. You can early sense where the story is going. It is a story that entertains rather than surprises. It is the writing that lacks. Cameron's earlier movies had great dialogue and memorable quotes. Avatar honestly doesn't have those. And then we have the actors. Unfortunately, if I shall be honest Sam Worthington is not a charismatic actor. But it's not all his fault. Cameron can create amazing characters but here they feel thin. None of the actors here are bad but their characters are weakly written. The characters have this predictable feel too them in the same way as the plot. Not bad in any way just nothing more than pretty standard. All this said sounds so negative, the problem is just that I guess my demands on James Cameron are so high. Avatar is a very good and greatly entertaining movie. Technically amazing but when you see past the brilliant effects this is not the masterpiece some were expecting and some are claiming. 8/10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">To be honest I went to see the first 3D movie and not really the film.<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed the movie if i'm honest. It's not as good as Terminator 1 or 2 or even the Abyss but it is a pleasant film.<br/><br/>OK the story is obvious and so is the outcome but most movies are if you think about it. Forgetting the 3D which I thought was excellent the movie plot is Hollywood standard dross but enjoyable. Sometimes you have to take the plot with a pinch of salt and just sit back and enjoy it for what it is. Visually stunning although it never looks real, maybe it wasn't meant to? I thought the effects were brilliant! It's the best 3D film I have seen actually the only one worth seeing in 3D.<br/><br/>It's one of the great Cinema experiences and a leap for 3D movies but the best film in 30 years as some are saying on here is a little strong to say the least! <br/><br/>All in all, good mindless fun where you don't have to think too much. 7/10 from me.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">As I said, this film has it's fair share of epic battles. I like this film but I'll be honest, by the time the two-and-a-half hours were up I was kinda bored. I mean, yes it kept you intrigued but I think that two-and-a- half hours is a reaaaly loooong time. It had a great story-line, although it was a tad confusing. I thought that Sam Worthington as Jake Sully did a very good job, as did Sigourney Weaver as Grace. It's set in the future and it can get a bit confusing as they keep skipping times, but it's definitely worth a watch. Overall I would say that Avatar is a good family film (if you can sit through 160 minutes!) but with quite a complex plot. I would rate it 8/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone 10+.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Some movies deserve a ten and this is one of them. Absolutely spectacular imagery and graphics. Spellbinding effects and scenes throughout the whole movie. This movie is a jump to a whole new realm of movie making not available in the 20th century. To have a movie based mainly in CGI create such feeling and spirituality just knocks my socks off. From the flying jellyfish to the natives to the creatures, I never thought I was watching an animated(mostly) movie. I might not take children under 7 to see this movie as there is a bit of violence and some sensuality. But for the shear beauty and revolution in movie making, I would definitely consider taking children under 10. As an adult who is based in \"real\" movies, I was glued to the TV throughout the whole adventure. If your real set in watching movies based completely in reality, I still say, give this movie a shot. At least through the first hour. The movie is long, very long at three hours but I didn't notice.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Without question this is the greatest action film, and the greatest science fiction film ever. For a long, long, LONG time I thought nothing could ever compare to Terminator 2. Well, if anyone could surpass it, it would be the man that made the original film, and that's what James Cameron has done.<br/><br/>Anyone complaining about no character development has NOT seen the film. An hour and 50 min of the film is spent on ONLY character development. These are some of the most well rounded and in depth characters I've seen in a film. Sigourney Weaver literally breaths her part, as does Stephen Lang, and man, what a great bad guy he makes. In fact to call this an action/science fiction is pretty dishonest. 50% of the film is character drama.<br/><br/>The visuals are indeed the best ever. The war scenes near the end are simply stunning. The Na'vi I felt looked a bit off at first, but they fit perfectly in the alien world made for them.<br/><br/>The action of the film is mind blowing, and the second half of the film will likely cause you to stand up and cheer. It was very hard for me not to.<br/><br/>By the end, the entire theater applauded, I have never been to a showing of a film and seen that before, but my God this film earned it.<br/><br/>Stunning sites, great action, and really some of the best acting in a film I've ever seen. Everyone in this film should get an Oscar. EVERYONE In short, you must see this film, and if you've seen it already, SEE IT AGAIN!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It was undoubtedly a brilliant set, the amazing detail that had gone into everything on Pandora; the plant life, the animals and the Na'vi themselves. It was beautiful how they showed the luminescent plant life in the night and the details of the daytime planets.<br/><br/>I just wish they'd spent more time on the plot, it was too predictable for my liking.\n",
       " As soon as they explained the premise of 'driving' the avatar bodies I had figured out the plot; the main character would integrate himself with the natives using his avatar body, fall 'in love' with the native people, then switch allegiance's as they fought off the invading human army who the main character had worked for, naturally they would win and he would stay with the natives on Pandora when everyone else left.<br/><br/>How they transferred his mind from his human body into his avatar body was inventive and something I hadn't considered, and Sigourney Weaver's death was a plot twist which didn't really affect the story but came as a surprise.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Hello everyone, today, I am going to tell you my feeling about the film « Avatar ». Avatar is a Sci-Fi movie, and it was released in 2009. This great movie was directed by James Cameron !\n",
       " The movie tells the story of Jake Sully who decided to go on planet Pandora. His job is to take control of his avatar. It's interisting because the human technologies are very nice in 2154, but the primitive tribes don't want to accept the deal. So, the humans want to fight for the precious metal, but Jake will defend the Na'vis, with riposting.\n",
       " The graphisms and the musics of the movie are incredible. All the plants, animals an Na'vis look so good and so real ! My prefer creatures were the Ikrans. I liked that Na'vis can be connected to Eywa, the Tree of Spirits, and \"goddess of Nature\". We can feel an attraction in the film with the main actors playing.\n",
       " Sam Wothing plays Jake, Zoe Salandra as the Na'vis' King's daughter, and, Sigourney Weaver plays the greatest Pandora's scientist. I rate that incredible movie 9,5 stars out of 10. You must watch it, because it's beautiful and it's unbeatable ! You will have stars in the eyes. :)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">My eyes were glued to the screen for the duration of Avatar. However my mind was working overtime taking notes. I've been watching James Cameron movies since Terminator. Mostly they are hit or miss for me. In short my favorites of his are Aliens &amp; Titanic. Avatar cribs a lot from Aliens mostly its characters. Giovanni Ribisi &amp; Paul Reiser are playing the same person in two different movies. The other problem with Avatar is after an hour I felt like I had seen everything I was going to see. The rest of the movie was the same stuff except bigger &amp; louder &amp; more of it. Also there is zero emotional investment in the characters because there is zero development. Everyone plays the part you see with no deviation at all. I felt more emotion watching Optimus Prime get killed in Transformers 2 than the anything in Avatar. Which brings me to another point why is Bay a hack &amp; Cameron a genius?! Could you imagine what would happen if the two ever teamed up?!<br/><br/>Anyway Avatar is what it promises a virtual thrill ride from start to finish so in that respect Avatar succeeds.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">For a movie that made a billion dollars, AVATAR was a huge disappointment. Visually, it's stunning. I didn't get to see the 3D version, but the 2D looked stunning nonetheless. With that said, I have to wonder:<br/><br/>1) The film takes place in the future, the computers and hand-held devices are all touch-screen, but the main character is using a non-motorized wheelchair? Nobody could spring for a Hoveround? And I would think there would've been a cure to his paralyzed legs in the future.<br/><br/>2) So in order to be welcomed by the Na'vi tribe, you must have a bunch of floating dandelions land on you and chant/pray to a jellyfish tree?<br/><br/>3) The Na'vi plug their braids into animals to bond? And the braids have tentacles? Ewwww!<br/><br/>4) Out of all the leading men to choose from, they had to cast Eric Bana 2.0? The lead actor was more wooden than the Hometree.<br/><br/>5) The Colonel seemed like a cross between John McCain, Clint Eastwood, and Donald Rumsfeld when stating their mission to fight the known unknowns...I mean, the Na'vi. <br/><br/>6) What's with Sigourney Weaver smoking like a chimney? You could practically smell the tobacco after a while. Surprised that she did set off a smoke alarm.<br/><br/>7) So the Na'vi have to fight the faux Millenuim Falcon, numerous helicopters with two fans attached to each one, a bunch of Optimus Prime wannabes, and some miniature Master Chiefs?<br/><br/>8) Seriously, two hours and forty-five minutes? The length wouldn't be so bad if there was a better script to follow.<br/><br/>9) You have scientists and the military working side by side in Pandora. Talk about a recipe for disaster.<br/><br/>10) Yes, the effects are great but when the characters are either stereotypical and/or bland, it's hard to care about anyone.<br/><br/>11) Special effects and 3D can never, ever compensate for a bad, predictable script that rips off everything from STAR WARS, LORD OF THE RINGS, DISTRICT 9, POCAHONTAS, DANCING WITH WOLVES.<br/><br/>12) If I want to watch politics, I'll watch MSNBC. I want a movie to entertain me, not preach to me.<br/><br/>13) She has a nice voice, but Leona Lewis is no Celine Dion. And the song itself is just as bland.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar sets a new standard of movie watching. It's said before and i agree. Avatar is beautiful, new, fresh, amazing. The 3D is so natural, we are on Pandora with Jake. The story did we see before, boy meets girl. Its like Matrix, its like Dances with Wolves. Weve seen this kind of story's a hundred times. But it doestn mather. Its not that important. But every scene breaths love for cinema. The 12 year of waiting for a new Cameron was worth every day. And now we wait for more amazing movies. But first we have to see Avatar. And see it again, and again. This movie should be seen by everybody who loves cinema. AMAZING!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I was very moved by this film. I saw it as an allegory of what the whites did to the natives in North America, South America, Australia, New Zea land and Tasmania (especially there)--almost complete genocide for the sake of monetary profit by corporate magnates. And since corporations are the real power in developed countries: they have carte blanche to kill as needed. They usually are clever in creating a body of lies that help to dehumanize the victims. (Easier to kill 'em).<br/><br/>The way to drive such a principle home, which means into the heart AND the head, is to show both sides. So we see the natives, Navi, in their culture which includes art, mythology, dance, music, and meaningful rituals. You can come to love any culture (even white European) if you are exposed to this side of humans. And in so doing, it would become horrible to wipe them out for the sake of a fat bank account back home. That is what Cameron does. He gets you on the side of the humanity, in this case, the Navi. (We already know about the dark side of homo Sapiens but it is well sketched in here by the mercenary grunts. I think DANCES WITH WOLVES tells much the same story. There the corporate element stays in the background which was OK for that film.<br/><br/>I was like a little boy visiting a heaven-like world with \"people\" who were conscious of other things besides money and power. In the back of my mind I wondered that any race could be that harmonious. North American \"Indians\" treated other tribes horribly in most areas like on the the Plains and conducted raids and wars where there was much cruelty. (See the film THE BLACK ROBE, for a New England version of this.) Were the Navi like that? And what if they were? I guess the question is greed. Given the means would some Navi have exterminated other tribes and gotten rich? They didn't seem to need to be rich.<br/><br/>So are all intelligent bipedal creatures alike? I once heard a theory about why there are no space travelers from beyond--if they became as intelligent as we, they'd also encounter the same jealousies and greed that we have, thus preventing them from combining their resources and cooperating--the infighting would bar them from space travel.<br/><br/>A wonderful epic film. The love story was poetic. The creatures were beautiful and scary. So were the plants. The hero started off a klutz but grew on me. And I liked hearing Wes Studi's voice again. He was the \"bad\" Indian in DANCES as he was in LAST OF THE MAHICANS.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I was honestly very disappointed by Avatar, and this reaction is despite my enjoyment of the homage to Philip Jose Farmer and some other very well-executed scifi flourishes. My problem is that, as a social commentary, Avatar One was entirely misguided. I am a huge James Cameron fan, but he is at his best when telling stories, which he does quite well. So blowing up \"evil\" corporations is the way to save the world? How about looking at how it really is? These days, miners spend decades working out agreements with indigenous peoples, providing job training, repairing environmental damage, etc. Avatar is about 100 years out of date in its social commentary. In my own view of the long-term future, we will have unlimited fusion power, and raw materials will be derived primarily, perhaps entirely, through robotic recycling. So maybe we will leave the era of mining the earth entirely behind us (maybe we'll mine asteroids instead - space travel looks different when energy is virtually free). But Mr. Cameron is not telling us ANYTHING about what could make it better in future. He has no real technological imagination, and Avatar spells that out in spades. There are many brilliant failures in science fiction, and unfortunately, Avatar is yet another of them.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I gave to this movie a perfect 10 because it was very entertaining although it is not without it's shortcomings.<br/><br/>Let's break up my summary into pieces:<br/><br/>A unique experience because I was waiting for this movie for a really long time. In almost every sci-fi humans are the good guys with generally inferior technology. Well, not in this one.<br/><br/>Visually fascinating because it is, you have to see it, you just have to, trust me. The flying and \"horse\" riding scenes are very convincing but some of the body movement still needs some work, especially the bodies of the Omaticaya people. Another small issue is that I found a bit tiresome that on that planet everything was glowing even the grass they stepped on; this made the planet seem a bit artificial.<br/><br/>A fairy tale because it is a nice fable but in reality the story wouldn't end like this; and this is where my SPOILER SECTION STARTS: it would have been really hard to destroy those V-22 Osprey-like aircrafts especially because of the miniguns so this is why I'm saying that it was a nice fairy tale: the good guys won, the bad guys were punished. Yeah..., yeah..., you can tell me that I'm a negative person, but I'm telling you even if the Omaticaya won that time, the next attack will be a lot shorter, it takes only one ballistic missile with a tactical nuclear warhead to destroy their oh-so-precious tree.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Yes James Cameron's done it again, gripped the world in a matter of days with another blockbuster of groundbreaking special effects which seem like they are years ahead of their time. Set in 2154 on Pandora we follow Jake Scully a wheelchair bound marine who is asked to take his twin brothers place for the Avatar programme. Admittedly Worthington doesn't particularly shine as Jake especially in the first part of the film where his acting seems to lack any emotion at the loss of his brother. Fortunately this isn't the case for the whole film; it develops dramatically when he becomes one of the local Na'vi people; portraying it brilliantly and convincingly throughout the rest of the film. The Na'vi mesmerise with such little effort and realism throughout the film and simply because they are more lifelike than anything ever seen on the cinema for such a long time, which is understandably why it was delayed for so long after being scripted since 1994 by Cameron. The sheer beauty and scale of his vision which he has depicted perfectly in the film is an overwhelming sight that flourishes gloriously for your eyes. The big and small details of Avatar such as the way the floor glows beneath their feet or the fact that they have their own unique culture seems to make everything about this film so lifelike and immersing to watch. Zoë Saldaña gives fantastic support as a local Na'vi who shows Sam what it means to be one of them, and oh boy do you wish you could be there with them. It's the most surreal, thrilling and downright gripping experiences of 2009. No it's unlikely to change cinema for you so that nothing will compare to it but it's a film unlike any other and a definite must see especially in 3D.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar - probably the most hyped film of last year mostly due to it's apparently ground-breaking visuals, but does it live up to it? Yes and no.<br/><br/>Acting: Worthington is a pretty bland lead - not terrible enough to be unbearable nor impressive enough to be memorable. He's simply passable. Saldana does go a bit OTT here and there in her reactions as Neytiri and puts on an exaggerated ethnic accent but she's better and more charismatic than her love interest.<br/><br/>The only stand outs are the morally confused Ribisi and Lang as 'the ultimate baddie bas-ass', Colonel, who plays his role with enthusiasm.<br/><br/>As aforementioned, the dialogue is cheesy and sometimes unintentionally hilarious with flat, archetypal characterisation. <br/><br/>Plot: What's to say? It's basically predictable from probably each scene to scene and the hackneyed storyline is hardly original. Even within the formula it could've been more inventive. It also lacks emotional investment in some places, concerning deaths.<br/><br/>There is some baggy scenes that could've been trimmed, probably, but time breezed by.<br/><br/>Cinematography/SFX: This is the crux of the matter of the film - what got bums on seats in the first place.<br/><br/>In 3D(which looks like a floating hologram in front of me), a lot of Pandora's visual wildlife and plants poke out of the screen at you. Interesting for a while, but the surreal novelty soon wears off, as it's more distracting than immersive. I mean 3D doesn't make Jake or Neytiri better characters or the plot any better because I can almost touch them, does it? 3D doesn't involve me more in a film, it just makes you aware of an aspect of the film that wasn't there before and has no relevance to plot or character etc.<br/><br/>The phosphorescent 'Billie Jean' night plant lights were silly, but I liked the animals and wildlife most. it looked pretty authentic for CGI, if still slightly manufactured looking.<br/><br/>Hated the Na'vi design - it's just risible. Part feline, part Abe Sapien and part anime, it just looks bizarre, aesthetically, from my point of view.<br/><br/>Score: Sounds like a slight remix of Titanic - pretty mediocre.<br/><br/>Overall: It is fun, but the stereotypes(the Na'vi are a mix of native Americans, African tribes and maybe Amazonian tribes for good measure) and silly ethnic accents with the heavy-handed environmental message is very clunky, and doesn't sit well with the flashy colourful, detailed visuals and weird character design, for me. This is a popcorn film, it doesn't need to take itself too seriously with messages, especially when you have a cartoony if photo-real ten foot blue alien as your main selling point. The romance was undeveloped and forced as well. Good, in terms of how Pandora looks but very flawed elsewhere. My guilty pleasure.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">You can really see where the $250,000,000 went. There's color and texture through every inch of the screen. And like every James Cameron film there is no expense spared on live sets. He really knows how to fill up a sound stage.<br/><br/>The story is really something to behold. A paralyzed soldier is recruited to pick up where his brother leaves off and gets new legs in the form of his avatar, a tribal, jungle dweller sent to stake out the traditions of a people for the purpose of reporting back their weaknesses so that they can be forced to move in order to obtain the rich natural resources that exists under their Lifetree, the source of their heritage and oneness.<br/><br/>When he falls in love with one of the female villagers and with the way of life of the peaceful, naturebound \"People\" he entertains second thoughts.<br/><br/>One can imagine the results. He's forced to make a decision. One to do what is right and protect a people susceptible to the strengths and ruthlessness of a greedy corporation, or back the plan of the Marines to remove or even eliminate the people for financial gain.<br/><br/>One cannot help but to draw comparisons between what we see on the screen (filmed during the Bush administration) and our presence in the Middle East and the American greed for oil.<br/><br/>The results are horrific. The ruthlessness is horrific to say the least. It is somewhat manipulative, and one can see clearly James Cameron's political bent. He paints the Marines as evil and willing to destroy the people with no more conscience than one would wipe out an ant hill.<br/><br/>The People fight back, with the help of the protagonist and a few Human friends and score some very deadly blows against the \"evil\" Marines.<br/><br/>I have never liked seeing American troops being killed, even when they're portrayed as being bad. I think the first, and maybe only time I've seen this is in the kid's movie, \"Small Soldiers\" and even then they were toys and not people.<br/><br/>The best message that the movie delivers is the need to respect not only the cultures of others regardless of our potential richening, but that the Earth is not merely a resource by which we satisfy our greedy desires but that we can live amongst nature and with it and cooperate with it, thereby being mutually benefited.<br/><br/>The message is a little heavy handed at times, and it can be a little distracting, but the beauty of the film's art is awe inspiring and James Camercon's love of detail takes one's breath away.<br/><br/>To see Sigourney Weaver do what she does, even at 61, is wonderful. Is another Ripley vehicle in store? We shall see.<br/><br/>8 out of 10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I am amazed by some of the responses to this film, especially the people who thought they wouldn't like it. I suppose audiences are still wowed by the same old 3D tricks that vfx studios have been pulling off since the beginning of this decade. The only difference is that Avatar is completely oversaturated with every cg gimmick you could imagine.<br/><br/>A tired re-telling of cowboys vs. indians, Cameron treats his audience like simpletons and idiots with a message that couldn't be more in-your-face and oblivious - and just in case you don't understand parts of it, he throws in some unnecessary narration by the main character for good measure. I mean really, the Na'vi couldn't be more stereotypical Native Americans, and the resource on the planet of Pandora is called Unobtanium? Ha ha ha, I get it, unobtainable, wow that's really deep Cameron. I'm moved.<br/><br/>I have to give credit to WETA Digital - the studio that brought Cameron's \"vision\" to life - for doing an excellent job on the visuals and breaking the uncanny valley (as far as blue lanky \"humanoids\" go.) That aside, this film has laughable writing, predictable, boring characters, and a repackaged shame-on-you cheeseball message about raping the earth and white guilt.<br/><br/>I really don't understand people's love affair with Cameron and this corny film. At least I can give him credit for being right about the fact that most people still can't see a crappy screenplay through amazing visuals he had no part in. A year from now people will be watching this on their regular TV screens and wondering what they thought was so great about it. Trust me - this movie will only impress in theaters. It has no value beyond mindless entertainment. And as far as the message, you might as well watch Ferngully or Pocahontas and spare yourself the terrifying and ugly designs of the Na'vi.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In some ways this movie is trying to be an adult version of Ferngully the last rainforest. The part of the world inhabited by these creatures, the 'moldy h icans' is like a director's wet dream of Eden, only with attractively plant draped mountains that float (instead of bolting into space). Meanwhile the inhabitants are a wide range of large or stretched versions of creatures we are familiar with: Big big bugs or flying reptiles.<br/><br/>It is a concept flick- man through technology transmits mind into fabricated creature that can live among the intelligent kind of its homeworld. The homeworld has something we (evil humans) want. Humans cannot live on planet but we want a precious material which defies gravity, baldly called unobtainium. The aliens are blue, and look (pick one) like elongated supermodels (every one of them) or cat people with no fur or whiskers. Either way you get wide faces and big yellow eyes right off those 70s paintings on black velvet only with pouty lips. One possibly somewhat original idea is that the intelligent social aliens have tails, at the end of which are exposed nerve fibers that can bond with significantly useful critters to ride, such as a reptilian eyed large flyer, or other critters where the nerve endings might come from other parts of their bodies like a tail to head mind-meld.<br/><br/>I do not recall any of these sharp toothed creatures eating or any significant blood flow from anything. Even the roots of the trees are nerve endings according to the Sigourney Weaver character. Meanwhile, there are no latrines, these natives apparently wander around the vertical environment making nerve contact with wondrous beings but don't need to eat, defecate, raise children, set broken bones, sign contracts, clear leafmold, or establish a government. They don't apparently make music unless they are all arrayed in a large pattern helping the roots save someone's life or convert them to alienhood. It's like woodstock without the rain, the mud, or for that matter, the music. The movie soundtrack was by James Horner who seemed to channel tangerine dream at times, and John Williams at other times. So sometimes the music was spacy, and other times it was star wars.<br/><br/>It goes on for 2 and a half hours and is excruciatingly unbelievable on its own terms. More than the ten bucks, it's the 2 and a half hours I'll never get back and the pained look I could feel on my face as the bad guys were made to look really bad, driving bulldozers ten stories high or trying to destroy an especially important part of the fiber tree of life.<br/><br/>If you loved the self-righteous extermination of the environment to make a point such as \"On Dangerous Ground\" where the good guys blow up an arctic oil refinery in order to promote environmentalism, this film may resonate with you.<br/><br/>Personally, I think putting the ten dollars to a meal with a lot of fiber in it would have had more agreeable results with a better end product.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Confused already? No? Well apparently millions of people weren't either,when they declared this to be one of the best movies they've seen in their lives,and then presumably bought a second and third and fourth cinema ticket to see this.I am not one of those people.I was confused.And amused.And pardon me for saying this,but I had to wake up the latent retard in me to be able to enjoy riding flying dragons,some unidentified horse-like hippo,a Jurassic something and a whole world apparently perfect. Well,that bothers me.Nothing is perfect.Even when you're high,you know that you're going to have a hang-over.Those Navi's were so perfect that it made me suspicious.The movie doesn't show this,but i bet they were into something really nasty,like attacking other tribes and raping all the women.And I bet they had their way with those flying dragons.Yes,I'm talking zoophilia with a dragon.Nevermind connecting neuron pony tales,how about connecting some penis and dragon pussy.Disgusted already? Now you know how I felt when watching Avatar.Oh yes,the CGI was ground-breaking.Let's hope next time Cameron just employs hundreds of Indian and Chinese computer programmers to give us Avatar 2, no actors,no common sense,no plot,just a diluted message and just computer generated Navis being perfect in their perfect world.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I heard about Avatar about 2 years ago and ever since I have been watching it carefully waiting for Cameron to deliver the incredible visuals he promised. The first trailer left me bummed, I was afraid Cameron had lost his edge and was making another sappy Titanic-like movie. My fears only grew when the reports that the plot was a cheap formula of movies we'd already seen. I figured the only way to know for sure how the movie was was to see it for myself.<br/><br/>After waiting a week for the hysteria to die I down I went to see the film today. I sat in awe as the master, James Cameron, weaved a familiar tale in an unfamiliar world. That's why I think Cameron went with a story similar to those that had been told before, because the skin they made over top of the story is what really makes this a unique adventure. Everything in this unreal world looks real. CGI objects and creatures look like they have mass and every detail is so incredibly intricate you might find it hard to believe (I did). This isn't your father's CGI, this is some next level stuff. There is so much to absorb, it's like a feast for the eyes. You thought Star Wars and Jurassic Park blew you away visually? You thought The Matrix revolutionized special effects? You ain't seen nothing yet.<br/><br/>This is the first film I've ever seen in the new Digital 3D mainly because I thought 3D was a gimmick but this movie is worth the 3D ticket price. It truly is an incredibly immersive film. Sam Worthington plays it brilliantly, he goes through Pandora filled with child like curiosity that really helps the audience connect with him, after all we too are curious to explore this new world. The film follows the formula to the letter but Cameron is the master, he hasn't lost a step, and he knows how to do this story perfectly.<br/><br/>As for the film's sentimentality I found it tolerable. There is plenty of heart but not so much that you'll find yourself rolling your eyes at the cheesiness of it. Everything is there in balance. It takes the gritty alien versus human story Cameron did in Aliens and blends it with some of the more sappy emotional stuff he did in projects like Titanic. It makes perfect sense that Cameron, the man who's been experimenting with CGI and cutting edge special effects since the Abyss in 1989, would bring us another breakthrough. There is a message and I think it's a message that it fairly timeless.<br/><br/>There isn't much of anything bad to report though in the hours since I saw it I've tried to come up with something, anything, to point out as a flaw. Aside from a script that isn't exactly a masterpiece of writing what we have here is a competent sci-fi action film every bit as good as Cameron's older work. Still, I'm hoping he does something a little more gritty next time (crossing my fingers for a sequel to Aliens). To me this movie is proof that story and acting do not have to suffer when CGI is heavily used and George Lucas could learn a thing or two from Cameron.<br/><br/>Put aside your skepticism and see this if you haven't already.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Yes, the visuals in Avatar are awesome. I saw it in 3-D and agree that it looks amazing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it still isn't that great. In fact, it's the most over-hyped and overrated movie of the year. Anyone wanting more than special effects (intelligence? god forbid) is not going to have fun at this movie. I suspect that the more movies you've seen, the less Avatar will impress you. Of course, even the critics (inexplicably) think this is the greatest thing since canned spam, so perhaps I'm wrong.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Avatar is that its story is mind-numbingly generic, mediocre, unoriginal, predictable pap. It's Ferngully with better special effects. There weren't any twists or surprises here to engage or interest me in the slightest, which made for a dull and sometimes extremely boring film. The film's fans claim that \"every story has already been told\" and therefore we shouldn't criticize it. But that's nonsense. If no new film ever had any suspense, people would quickly stop watching them.<br/><br/>And then there's the running time. At 80 minutes, Avatar might have been tolerable. At 162, it's an endurance test. Especially with the lame characters and recycled story.<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't think I could even sit through this bore a second time.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">What else to say, hmmmmmm lots of CGI, stolen plot, waaaaaaay to long.<br/><br/>Pretty sure this paved the way for the modern lazy film writer. Why bother when you can rip off another film and do world class special effects. Might as well look at a computer screensaver for three hours.<br/><br/>World class special effects. Nothing else going on.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Finally, as one of the seemingly few remaining human beings not to have seen Avatar yet, I had an invite to join 3 fellow film fans (two of whom had already seen the film) to visit our nearest multiplex showing the film in 3D, an invite not to be turned down.<br/><br/>So finally having experienced the most financially successful film of all time what was my opinion. Well, there is no denying that the special effects are quite amazing - this is a film that has to been seen in 3D, I just could not imagine it 'flat - yet as for the story line I could not help but think I had seen it all before.<br/><br/>During the journey home I mulled the story over in my mind and pieced it together thus - you take a little '2001 A Space Odyssey', throw in a dash of 'First Blood - Rambo', add a dollop of 'Last of the Mohecians', mix just about 'boy meets girl, boy loses girls, boy and girl get together in the end', and finally stir with a splash of almost all the recent eco-porn movies and thus you have 'Avatar'. Don't get me wrong, this does not mean the film doesn't have merit - it moves at a nice pace, the action sequences are superb, the characters display some real depth and as a whole it is very watchable, but just do not expect anything really original or totally mindblowing.<br/><br/>If you have not experienced this film yet do so, you will enjoy it even if only on a basic level, but I do urge you to check out the 3D version where the effects come to life, and avoid the standard version.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I thought the whole point of the story was that they used those Avatars to acclimate with the indigenous people (without them realizing they were dealing with humans). Then when they first go into the forest, they're wearing camouflage and Stanford U T-shirts? Why look like the native people, if you're not going to be dressed like them? The natives obviously know about the \"Sky People\" and they don't seem surprised that the newcomers are \"Sky People\" and not the same as themselves.<br/><br/>I also thought it unlikely that the people and the animals of the planet would ALL evolve with those linkage interfaces (pony-tails). Interesting idea, just didn't think it would happen.<br/><br/>If the ruthless military wants the unobtainium (which is a lame name, by the way), stop jerking around and blowing up trees, just kill all of the people and be done with it. If they're gonna drop all of those explosives, it's what they want to see happen anyway, right? Before the scene with the destruction of Hometree, there didn't actually ever seem to be a scene of negotiation for the land. What's the point of the whole Avatar project if not to come to some sort of negotiation? I thought the helicopters looked like Terminator helicopters and I thought those human-control machines looked like the forklift suits in \"Aliens\".<br/><br/>It was beautiful to watch (and the battle at the end kinda made up for the other stuff) but I was thinking about all of the inconsistencies throughout the movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This is not a movie of great depth. The story is preachy and old. We heard it with the Egyptians, Romans... exploitation and political. But empty your heads mates for it is visually stunning. Cameron likes his films slightly blue and he likes to blow things up, so in that aspect there is nothing different in this. However, what is obvious is how WETA has firmly planted its self as the CGI hero of the film industry; without WETA, this film wouldn't make it to screen - Cameron or no. As we have seen in Lord Of The Rings with its ground-breaking modeling of Gollum, Avatar focuses on bringing an entire alien race to a world of love, hate, hurt, pleasure, shock and bewilderment with expression and content. Story aside, watching Sams Jake experience legs and touch a new world was like watching a baby take its first steps. The luscious foliage and odd fauna suggest a lot of what we already know is disappearing all over the world, so it goes without saying it is all a part of building the usual sympathy as one would hear the slaughter of the native Americans and the last of the buffalo. History does have a way of repeating its self. That much we know. And it is sad.<br/><br/>Aside from the obvious plot-holes, only a few have really done a wtf on the vision of the music for this movie, and it has left me pondering if maybe an investment in Howard Shore would have been a better bet than the traditional sticking to what you are comfortable with. I love James Horner's music and what he did with Titanic will always be at the top of one of the best music scores written. But as someone already stated, the song \"I See You\" had all the musical measure of a automatic garage door opener; it just plain sucked. The other thing is that Shore and Williams have become known for \"Themed\" music that has a habit of sticking in your brain for days like peanut butter to the roof of your mouth. When I walk away from numerous viewings I still can't remember any of the music, and with the ending song I say: \"Thank GOD!!\" <br/><br/>Cameron shows us he spares no personal expense with this movie; you can see his finger in just about every minute detail like the 3D bugs that are depth focusable, to the ugly machines of man used in war and control (unfortunately his models for military transportation is sadly lacking in comparison with the movies extreme technology). I am not sad I have watched a couple of times before I wrote this review. All said, I had a wonderful time at the movies.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Going into this film I personally had a great amount of optimism surrounding what I was going to see. Fortunately those expectations were justified, Avatar was as exciting as it was spectacular due to outstanding effects. It may have been the 3-D element that was the springboard for this but I was never bored by what was being out on screen. Sometimes an onslaught of special effects can end up becoming a bore and I question what on earth is going on. The end of the Transformers sequel springs to mind when I think of this.<br/><br/>Avatar mixed the brilliant effects with a relatively interesting storyline that held my attention and didn't bring up too much explaining. It drew upon a concept and sort of modernised it making it a good spectacle. A mass of explanations would have been enormously frustrating but gladly this doesn't prove to be the case.<br/><br/>To summarise though Avatar is massively enjoyable and a brilliant spectacle for the modern cinema-goer.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I saw it on 2D yesterday. Let me say two things here, this is NOT the Cameron who made T2 and Aliens .and maybe all those special effects are worth the money spent on the admission ticket. I think Cameron made this movie for the studios(FOX){he's on a fixed salary from Fox;and last I read ,it had many leading zeros}}whereas T2, aliens were movies that he made for himself and there's the subtle difference. The story has potential but is not expertly delivered. I mean why spend zillions on hi-tech labs with neurosynaptic links with human hosts when an hour later ,all you have to do is let the trigger happy corporate honchos blast the navi village out of oblivion;why not just do it even before the first brick of such a lab even gets laid....sorry story here is not really consistent. Cameron has not shown anything that has not been shown to audiences in the last 15 -20 years in Hollywood. <br/><br/>1)robot suit fighters = robot suit donned by Sig. weaver in aliens <br/><br/>2)battle of choppers (hi-Tech) v/s beasts and rodents(lo-tech) = starship troopers.<br/><br/>3)tough talking female chopper pilot = from 'Pvt. Vasquez'fame in aliens <br/><br/>4)trigger happy corporate honchos = same stuff as in 1985 aliens,anything new? <br/><br/>5)literally the 'Red leader' squadron act at the end (rebels taking on the Imperial might) = star wars <br/><br/>and many more ;Cameron is out of ideas and has just reimplemented those great ideas he made up in his hey days. Avatar is no way close to T2 ,Aliens but did I say ,hey it's worth the penny..... just to gape and awe at the Sfx. used.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Let me first say that I am not a fan of 3D. My vision is good but I do not have good depth perception so 3D things usually seem out of focus and annoying to me. The old red/blue glasses or even the gray ones at Disneyworld and such are distracting and annoying so I have avoided most 3D things. I really wanted to see Avatar though so I braved it. I am happy to say that the 3D was MUCH better than I thought. There are no things coming at you or cheap tricks about it and it really did make things seem deeper and more alive. The glasses were much better than I had thought and I did not find them distracting. If other 3D movies are done even partly as well as this, I will definitely see 3D again.<br/><br/>Now, as to the movie itself, I had to keep reminding myself that all that I was watching was computer animation. It is extremely easy to believe that it is real. It does not look like a video game or any animation I have ever seen before. Wow does not cover it. As I have seen new things in movies (whether Star Wars, superman flying, etc.) that marked advances in technology, I have always been amazed and this was no exception. It is easy to believe the things you see in the movie and that helps keep you in the story and entertained. Cheap FX can ruin a good movie or too much FX can overwhelm a movie. In this one, the FX are just there and are outstanding while a good story is told.<br/><br/>The story is a rather old one and not too unique. As you can tell from the plot summaries, it is similar to the US with the American Indiains or many other incidents of one culture encountering another who has a resource the first culture needs. So the story itself is acceptable but it is the manner of telling the story and developing it that makes this movie rate a 10 to me.<br/><br/>It is hard to comment on much without seeming to spoil something. I can say that the movie initially feels like you came in late and missed the first few chapters of a book or 10 minutes of the movie but it is okay because they do quickly fill in the blanks. I found myself leaving the theater wishing there was more to see and wanting to see more about the world of Pandora. One of my favorite things is that they took the time to explain why the aliens can speak and understand English (a common thing in most movies that usually gets overlooked) and it is just a sign of how careful James Cameron was with the elements of this movie.<br/><br/>It is a definite Must See and one I highly recommend seeing in the theater since you will miss a great deal not seeing this on the big screen. I now wish I had an IMAX near me to try to see it in IMAX.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">No doubt that Avatar has some mind blowing and truly impressive special effects, which is about as fantastic as it gets.<br/><br/>With the fear of getting killed now, I dare to say it anyway: Avatar has stolen 90 percent of it's story from Dances With Wolves and Pocahontas. It is the story about a soldier, who is sent to spy on the locals on the planet Pandora to learn their weaknesses, so the military can move them because their land contains valuable minerals. The soldier gets very close to the locals, gains their trust, becomes one of them, falls in love with one of them and starts to fight for them. Does it sound familiar?<br/><br/>Though the story is embarrassing ordinary and nowhere near the Oscar material James Cameron hoped it to be, Avatar is still a joy ride from start to finish. The special effects are stunning, the actors do a good job and the film leaves you with a great feeling.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">AVATAR has a strikingly familiar plot, because it's so archetypal that you've probably seen it somewhere between ten and one hundred times already. \"Dances With Wolves\" comes to mind, as does \"Fern Gully\". This is a good thing: by making the story simple, James Cameron shifts the focus from plot to setting, and of course the phenomenal CGI has been labored over with such attention that the setting totally steals the show. It's detailed and gorgeous and breathtaking, exactly as it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>The story, straightforward and predictable as it is, manages to be quite compelling. The imperialist human corporation wants to strip-mine the world Pandora, and they've got some serious military hardware on their side. The native Na'vi and their sentient living world take exception, and the stage is set for scenes of heartbreak and spectacular action set-pieces. Our hero is Jake, a rather self-centered former marine who becomes one of the natives.<br/><br/>The moral is basically \"humans are jerks\". That will probably turn some audience members off, because who likes being called a jerk? And yet here we are, in a country our ancestors stole by murdering, relocating, and poisoning the natives, and we're gradually but steadily stripping our own world of its natural resources. Our forests are vanishing and many animal species are on the path to extinction. We want to drill for oil in national parks, because not driving cars is too much trouble. The Na'vi clearly have the right idea.<br/><br/>The movie only has one real problem that I can see: the hero, Jake, has a spinal injury that confines his human body to a wheelchair. Part of his motivation for siding with the Na'vi seems to be the freedom his avatar body grants him. The moral there, probably unintended by Cameron, is that life with a disability can never be fulfilling. It's a rather unfortunate aesop in an otherwise clear-headed movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Rewatching this on Blue-Ray, I discovered that Avatar feels as fresh and engaging now as it did upon its release. It's a genuinely brilliant and entertaining piece of filmmaking... even if its underlying premise is a bit cliché (which it is).<br/><br/>The cliché part is that Avatar is at its heart a stock White Savior narrative: a lost soul leaves the world of the white man to encounter the noble natives, discovers the value of life and the beauty of other cultures, and turns against his rapacious former comrades. I've seen actual arguments about whether Avatar was more indebted to Dances With Wolves or Ferngully, but it's the wrong question. They're all indebted to a White Savior narrative that's been part of film and literature for a long time.<br/><br/>Now, such narratives, by providing a viewpoint character they can relate and identify with, really *are* an important way to get mostly-white audiences to care about the plight of primitive cultures and the environment. But they're not the only way, and admittedly it would be nice to see film grow beyond this narrative template. Since that's not going to happen in Hollywood probably ever, though, it's more worthwhile to evaluate Avatar as an exemplar of its species. And on those grounds, Avatar delivers in every way. <br/><br/>Its greatest triumph, of course, is the planet Pandora -- a character unto itself, and not just metaphorically. Pandora is what is most memorable about Avatar: a vivid, minutely-detailed Garden of Eden that provides a stage for the inevitable battle between technology and nature that nature, for once, gets to win. Pandora's power derives of course -- and this is what made Avatar's arrival so timely -- from our own anxiety about the obviously deteriorating condition of our own world. It's a love letter to the kind of wild nature our civilization has almost annihilated. This makes it powerfully attractive, and awe-inspiring -- and also depressing at a certain level in that it's a mere digital construct -- and ensures the planet's beauty in and of itself becomes something to root for.<br/><br/>A special note of appreciation also goes out to the film's bad guys. Cameron gets a lot of flak for supposedly having made them into \"stereotypes,\" but I think what really has that kind of detractor anxious is that the Colonel and Selfridge in the film are pretty much straight ports of present-day American military and corporate attitudes into an SF setting... and the picture they present is *unflattering.* Of course, that something is unflattering doesn't make it untrue, and Cameron and his actors have precisely the pulse of both kinds of character: the Colonel giving his \"safety brief\" about the hostile wilds of Pandora could be a 21st-century American officer briefing his troops about \"the f***ing hajjis\" or \"f***ing Mooj;\" Selfridge's sociopathic corporate berkishness is if anything *dialed down* from the venality, cluelessness and viciousness of real-life equivalents. Both characters are ably portrayed -- Ribisi's work as Selfridge is particularly standout.<br/><br/>The Na'Vi are of course SF variants on the \"noble savage\" trope, but they're convincingly realized -- down to a language that clearly showcases real and serious conlanging effort -- and beautifully designed and fill out their role perfectly. Zoe Saldana's performance as Neytiri comes through remarkably well through the digital effects. And the effects themselves are spectacular.<br/><br/>Everyone else performs capably, the action is dazzling and exciting, the final battle set piece is well worth the price of admission all on its own... it's still definitely worth seeing.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I remember all this hype around this film, it was exteremely popular and many told it was the most extraordinary film they had ever seen. But is it now? Certainly not. It is the product of its time and it doesn't look so stunning in 2021. Of course all this unique world and CGI drew our attention in 2009, but most of us didn't notice that there's hardly anything more than graphics that is new and unique about this film. Its story is a bunch of predictable cliches about an encounter with a different civilization. To the most famous films which showed us exactly the same sequence of storytelling belong Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas and The Last Samurai. In such stories we have a protagonist who is on the side of his people and wishes to fulfill his duty, then he acidentally happens to be among his enemies which turn out to be the good guys, understands how bad his own people are, trains his new allies to be more effective against his former friends and bosses. In some cases he may also have relationship with their woman. And in the end they win suffering great losses. We had seen absolutely everything from Avatars story except for new planet and slightly different reason for protagonist to begin his journey. Some scenes were even taken directly from The Last Samurai. Oh, and that 3D, which was in every more or less expensive movie till 2015, having only a f few effects, but making films dark and harder to watch.<br/><br/>After 2009 we've seen dozens of films looking more realistic visually and suggesting us more interesting stories without constant repetitiveness, so I see no reason to watch Avatar in 2021. Only if you want to see what film is the highest-grossing and to be aware of its story if you wish to see it's sequel next year, you can watch it. If you want neither of these things, you can skip this movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Cameron's 15 year in-the-making vision comes to life in all its visual glory. He envisioned a spectacular world and Peter Jackson's Weta studios does an amazing job to bring it to life. The attention to detail and the creatures is really impressive. My favorite scenes of the movie were the flying ones (jaw-dropping) and the final battle.<br/><br/>However, if Cameron had put the same sort of effort towards the story this would have been a movie for the ages. Too often the movie reminded me of a combination of Dances with Wolves, Jurassic Park, and Pocahontas; leading it to be quite predictable. The villains were one-dimensional, and some scenes were quite unnecessary (tribal mumbo-jumbo), and the whole political and environmental viewpoints. As for the 3d aspect of it, yes it does give the viewer an immersive experience, but it doesn't make or break the movie in my opinion (I'm yet to buy into this whole 3d riff raff) Overall, this is a movie that should be seen by everyone for its stunning visuals and for its purely entertaining adventure story .</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I am not going to give Avatar a star rating: a movie so technically excellent, and so banal in plot, acting and dialogue just cannot be reduced to one, five or ten stars.<br/><br/>Few would argue that the CGI and the relatively restrained use of 3D make this movie a landmark: Cameron's use of computer generated figures and sets in Titanic set a high standard for realism but Avatar takes the technology to a different level: give the film it's due. He resists the temptation to shove the action directly into the audiences' faces to show how impressive 3D can be. The generated forests are, literally, fantastic. The futuristic computer screens and control room sets have been created by people who know how to make these things appear believable. The CGI blue natives are less realistic, but still don't detract from the overall imagery. (One of the ironies of the present generation of CGI is that the closer the characters are to humans the more uncomfortable one is with the depiction - talking rat-chefs and Buzz Lightyears look more natural than computerised Shrek princesses - but that's by the bye.) (Some of the 3D cinematography is less effective than the rest: in particular, rapidly moving objects in the foreground move very jerkily, rather as if shot at such a low frame rate that the persistence of vision cannot blend the motion, and this make one a little vertiginous.) And yet.....<br/><br/>Hundreds of millions have here been expended on the technology, years of work by talented artists and computer programmers have gone into realising the final film, but somewhere along the road - probably from conception - Cameron has lost the plot. And that's the problem - there really *isn't* one, at least not an original, \"make you think\", plot. It's all been done before.<br/><br/>OK, there are such ironies as the visual 9-11 reference, but the overall sense that I had was of a waste of all that incredible technology. That will become the norm, and will be further improved, but it can only be effective if it is draped around, and complements, original screen writing.<br/><br/>The dialogue is often excruciating in its jingoism. Ms Weaver recites her lines monotonically, as if she's an infant auditioning for the Christmas Nativity play, and the gung-ho military men made me cringe with the clichés and their one dimensional personae. If - and it's big if - this jingoism is intentional and full of hidden meaning, it's a huge mistake. Imagine,if you will, this movie as a DVD on your LCD screen at home, no 3D and without the beautiful landscapes and floating mountains - could you really sit through 2½ hours of facile dialogue without falling asleep? I couldn't.<br/><br/>So: would I pay to see it again? Yes, but not for a while and only in IMAX or big-screen 3D, and mainly to enjoy the scenery. Would I buy the DVD and watch it at home? No: without all that gorgeous scenery and the various CGGI effects I really couldn't be bothered. Will it generate a handful of awards? Very probably, and deservedly so for the imagery. But if Oscars are given for the screenplay or the acting it can only be because of bribery during the voting process.<br/><br/>PS (Edited several days later):<br/><br/>I have been reading many of the other reviews of this film and have to take exception to descriptions of it as \"science fiction\". It is not - it is \"fantasy\".<br/><br/>SF - at least in the classical sense - takes a fundamental premise such as time travel or mind control, and builds a logical structure around it. Fantasy has no such limitation: it just keeps inventing more and more impossible layers and asks you to accept them without criticism. And that's the basic problem with Avatar's plotting and screenplay - it has no logical progression, and relies entirely on its admittedly stunning imagery.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Concerning Avatar, whether you would like this movie or not depends on what you expect from a motion picture in the first place. If those expectations are based on a bunch of meaningless effects, ear bleeding sound and screaming colors, Avatar is just the thing for you. Enjoy.<br/><br/>However, if you, like my self, want to see things like story, drama, acting, dialogs longer than 3 sentences and a point, don't waste your time and money... for your own sake.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spend any words describing the story because there simply isn't one. You can pretty much pick up all you need to know from the trailer itself. Bad guys, good guys, fight, good guys win, hero gets a chick, the end. Even Marvel comics have a deeper meaning.<br/><br/>Avatar is just another financial project. Invest a ton of money so you'd make two tons.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Whether you agree or not, James Cameron has a very distorted view on what the American military is like. He has probably watched Full Metal Jacket, The Last of the Mohicans, and Fern Gully too many times too.<br/><br/>The bad guys in the film were not American military but rather something that a liberal extremist conjured up to make a point on something that he clearly does not understand. <br/><br/>Avatar would have been a five star, if the anti-military propaganda was taken out. He could have just gone with a local enemy on the planet, something original. Everyone and their grandma has mentioned the fxs and it is because they were amazing. <br/><br/>If one were to look at the story and ignore the distorted view on the American military than this would be a well written one with a great cast of actors yet underdeveloped. <br/><br/>Someone please tell James Cameron that if he hates American policy so much that he would make up stuff against our fine military than he can move to France with Johnny Depp.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It was groundbreaking for its time, but now looking back it years later and not on giant theater screens, Avatar is preachy and bland. Paired with an unconvincing and farfetched storyline and wooded acting. This movie joins a long list of action movies with cool battle scenes that almost make you forget the rest of the movie was long and ridiculously boring.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">The overwhelming positive response to Avatar that has moved it to number 37 on the IMDb data base has been huge. The film is also set up to potentially becoming the biggest box office success in movie history surpassing even James Cameron's Titanic. Cudos to James Cameron (a Canadian folks).<br/><br/>But folks let's put things in perspective. Is it as good as Titanic? No. Is it as good as Star Wars especially the early ones like Return of the Jedi and the Empire Strikes back? We don't think so.<br/><br/>This is not to put down Avatar. The 3D effects are really really good. I was dubious at first but this was a wonderful experience in that respect. But where this film fails is that the story is predictable (ok so was Titanic - I mean every one knew the ship would sink)the characters largely stereotypes especially Stephan Lang playing Colonel Miles. When it came to the battle scenes parts of it was just cheesy especially some of the lines i.e. Come to daddy\". I burst out laughing as I did a few other times during that episode rolling my eyes at the same time.<br/><br/>The Navi were real good and Neytiri was certainly attractive but the love story while good did not live up to Jack and Rose in Titanic. Wes Studi as the father was interesting.<br/><br/>What this was quite simply was a simple tale of the Europeans arrival in North America in 1492 only this time the Europeans lost. Maybe they should have in 1492 as well but this time no disease wiped them out. At least not yet.<br/><br/>No this was a enjoyable film made into a really good experience with the 3D effects. But there are other films of similar type that are better - much better. So folks calm down. Good it is. Great it isn't.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar... the biggest movie of all time. Made $2,782,275,172 worldwide. Is it worth the hype? Let's find out. \"Avatar\" is the story of an ex-Marine who finds himself thrust into hostilities on an alien planet filled with exotic life forms. As an Avatar, a human mind in an alien body, he finds himself torn between two worlds, in a desperate fight for his own survival and that of the indigenous people. (RT summary) This movie has incredible computer effects. It truly is a breakthrough in animation, everything from the creatures to the world and plants, everything looks photorealistic, and I could believe a world like Pandora exist (Even though it doesn't) It is truly pure eye candy. Also the action scenes really kick serious ass. The script is what a lot of people have a problem with. And I more or less agree. The script is so cliché and it is all basically \"Dances With Wolves meets Aliens\". Now having said that, despite having been told a thousand times already, the story itself is really good. The script is full of likable characters, and the dialogue is also good. Also, it hits you over the head with its \"Save the environment\" message, which while I agree with it, it kind of gets annoying. And as for the runtime: I did not mind it. And the pacing was pretty quick and kept the film moving forward. The acting is also a mixed bag. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana ,Sigourney Weaver, and Michelle Rodriguez do terrific in their roles. But Giovanni Ribisi and Stephen Lang .... not so much. While not horrible performances, they are kind of \"Eh... I'm just here to collect my check\". While it certainly isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, James Cameron's Avatar is a pretty darn good sci-fi flick.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Just a quickie, i'm not going to drone on, this was brilliant, BRILLIANT. This is entertainment friends, exciting, action packed, engaging, romantic, funny, its report card is all As, it passed every class. <br/><br/>The story alone is timely and relevant, it demands consideration of its issues from even the most passive viewer. Add to that the jaw dislocating effects and top it off with great actors doing their best work and Jimbo's done it again.<br/><br/>Is this worth my Pounds, Dollars, whatever ? wholeheartedly YES, even if your not normally a sci-fi kind of soul, its much more than that, see it 3D, see it Imax, just see it, it really is that good.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">When I first watched this movie, I wanted to get it on DVD straight-away. With the astounding cast of Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver, this movie was fantastic. When the extended collector's edition arrived at last on my doorstep, I promptly put it into my DVD player and watched it again. Since, this has been one of the prized discs of my DVD collection. The dialogue, lighting, camera angles, acting, and story, was all fantastic. This is one of my top 10 favorite movies. I think one of the hi-lites of the film is the dramatic and super large-scale battle between the Na'vi and the Sky People. The results however, will be unraveled for you if you watch the film for yourself. The special effects were the most realistic I've ever seen in a sci-fi movie. Compared to Syfy original movies, which I trash a lot, this movie was big chest of gold and platinum, and Syfy original movies are a small box of plastic coins. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to action, sci-fi, and, well, good movies. 10/10: A+ Two enthusiastic thumbs up!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'll try and not spoil too much with this review.<br/><br/>OS = This movie is easily among st one of the best movies I have seen, but that seemed to be the case when it comes to James Cameron movies.<br/><br/>1= This movie is visually stunning right from the beginning not only visually stunning but also beautiful, you could also pause the movie at any point and your TV could be doubled as a over sized picture frame.<br/><br/>2= Not only this movie allows you to understand the Avatar Universe early but it also makes it easy for you to understand the Avatar Universe.<br/><br/>3= The plot from the movie to me feels almost like it could be a Star Trek Movie (NOT JJ ABREMS REBOOT). Of curse I'm talking about the classic Star Trek Movies.<br/><br/>4= There is an Alien creature in the movie that kind of looks like of an Alien Xenomorph.<br/><br/>5= The Pandora Planet also an African Jungle Amazon feel an look to it. The reason I found that interesting is because that is all I was thinking about while I was watching the movies as to the regards of the sitting in which the movie takes place.<br/><br/>6= As I was watching the movie I feel that the over all message of the movie is Cultural Understanding, and Cultural Acceptance more Understanding than Acceptance. Which goes along with my Statement from above. About the movie feeling like an idea for a Classic Star Trek Movie.<br/><br/>7= In addition as I was watching the movie I was constantly reminded of the metaphor of the old West in which the people in the West invade and attack the Native Americans but in space. In this case the Humans are the Western Invaders, and the Na'vi are the Native Americans.<br/><br/>8= The VO (Voice Over) in the movie is really great, it is told in the format of a Video Diary, and I'm not just talking about Jack the main character telling us what's going in the terms of his mission, but also in the terms of his changing feelings through out the movie and what is he planing what to do. And it's not your typical Video Diary VO either, it's not just VO in the beginning to open the movie and at the same time explain to us the audience what the world of Pandora is. And another VO at the end to close the movie up and at the same time to show what the effects of climax events had on both sides. No it's not like that at all, Jack the main character constantly provides his VO in his POV so it truly becomes a Video Dairy, and not just away for us the audience to know what is going on. And I like that it gives you a sense of feeling that the audience is a character in the movie, and that the main character Jack is constantly reporting back to you the audience in Video Diary format. Like you are an government official back on earth or something. I like movies that have that, it's too bad that not more movies have that.<br/><br/>9= Another thing I have noticed while watching the movie is that the main bases for the Na'vi Cutler, is being one with Nature. Now the Na'vi are literally one with Nature, but it got me thinking maybe humans should be with one with Nature. I'm talking MORE than JUST camping and hugging trees, no I'm talking about NOT holding innocent animals captive and NOT shooting innocent animals just for the sport of it. I think the only justly reasons to kill an animal is, A when you are protecting your self, and B when you need you need food while in nature. For me those are the ONLY two justly reasons to kill an animal(s), and the like. So in short I think we should try and take a page from the Na'vi Cutler's book and try and coexist with animals, because if we don't then I would agree with Agent Smith in the first Matrix movie when he said that Humans are nothing but a Diseases Plague a Cancer for this planet. I don't know about you but the very idea bring compered to an Infection is uneasy to me to say the least.<br/><br/>10= Any ways back to the cherry stuff, this movie is not only beautiful visually but as for the Emotional aspect that is also beautiful.<br/><br/>11= The Soundtrack. Not only it's the one of the best Soundtracks I have heard in any movie, but also the Soundtrack helps you care about the characters and what's going on at that point in time in the movie. But also at one point in the movie I thought the Soundtrack was so good I not only thought to myself that I got to get this Soundtrack, but also some of the music for this movie is so relaxing it puts you in a Meditative State at least it did for me. And on top of all that the Soundtrack for this movie I found that it also helps you get invested in more than just the characters in the movie but it also gets you invested in the movie as a whole, on what is happening at that point in the movie on what is about to happen, etc.<br/><br/>CS= Now the movie is not perfect I did have some minor problems in it, such as the Climax fight. And I have to admit at some parts it's really predictable like predicting who the real villain is early on in the movie. And finally I'm not sure this movie really needs a sequel, much less multiple sequels, to me it wraps everything up nicely. The only reason to make sequel(s) to this movies is I'm sorry to say Greed</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I watched it in 2009 it was like boring plot but beautiful graphics CGI and all that sort of stuff. And I tried to watch it nowadays, I managed to only first 40 minutes, everything feels so stupid and CGI looks like horrible. Why Iron Man CGI looked better than this super big movie in 2009? Have no idea</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Goodness me! Once again James Cameron takes mediocrity to new heights. He places the mediocrity in a box made of gold and elevates the box onto a platform with spotlights pointing at it. Goodness me! He destroyed the Alien franchise with his trashy and brash sequel and then he turned a real sea tragedy into a cliché ridden, money spinning bore fest(Titanic). Goodness me! It seems that any project with his name attached is bound for sure fire success because it's James 'Goodness Me' Cameron and we must, by law, consider his works genius. (Goodness me).<br/><br/>Avatar is a computer game. Nothing more. I want to see a MOVIE when I go to the cinema, thank you very much and a big Goodness Me!<br/><br/>I shall now declare a national holiday. I shall call it 'Goodness Me Day' in honour of James Cameron.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar gets a 10 because of its visuals and some of the natural soul satisfying themes therein. The rest of the film does not matter; I'll explain why.<br/><br/>The plot is as standard and as conventional as they come. The whole film is a collective of clichés and things we have all seen before on screen. A Marine without the use of his legs becomes part of a program on Pandora. Selected individuals become the 'avatars' that have been specifically engineered for them and go out into the alien world of Pandora. The objective: to study the natives, indigenous 'beasts,' life forms and layout of terrain in the interests of military tactical advantage. The Marine is given the incentive of government-approved working legs if he is successful in completing the objective. Marine, assisted by ever so cheesy, clichéd, cartoonish two-dimensional characters enters world, meets girl, meets tribe, learns ways, gets accepted, falls in love, and ultimately decides in all predictability that Pandora is more valuable to him than the 'real' world. That's about ten or so films that we can all list covered so far. And so 'jarhead' ultimately becomes protagonist, protector and defender when the 'good' guys who are fighting the 'savages' decide it's time to eradicate and show them just who is boss. Don't you love the mentality :) <br/><br/>So, back to the reason of sitting in the theater with 3-D glasses. It takes a little while, but the reason for every Effects house, department, and agency working on a 400-million dollar film becomes oh so very apparent. So I am a gamer, very much accustomed to playing pretty games on high-end tech. I am also a film geek, details, details, details. So, you will understand that when the lights go down a little and I'm looking at 'other worldly' vegetation full of sap or rain water, and I sit there shaking my head because my brain can't seem to compute that specially created/generated foliage defies that very concept. When the lights go down on Pandora I might as well be looking out of my own window. Indeed, I was also dubious when I heard a similar statement. Avatar, when you get past - but can't really get past - because you are looking at animation that looks so real that you can instantly (pretty much) tell who the actor is behind the 'mask' - the phenomenal visuals. You are allowed to smile, and perhaps to have your eyes well up a little, with Jake's first encounter as a 'Dragon' rider. Here perhaps is a nod to Anne McCaffrey's 'Pern.' The rider chooses the Dragon and the Dragon the rider. When the bond is made, they become one. <br/><br/>I want to get back to the characters again. Remember when I said details, details, details: The skin, the eyes, the flakes of dust that land on the skin after an explosion, the ears that move and stretch. the physical motions and motor skills. What is the expression I am looking for.. 'more human than human'. OK, time to close. The weakest link, in my opinion, and I truly hate to say this out of my respect for one of the mothers of sci-fi, is Sigourney Weaver's character. Rather than playing a secure, natural maternal scientist we have a re-hashed Ripley after 23 years, only it only serves to weaken the experience. As soon as Sigourney opens her mouth, I want her to close it. It's not big, it's not clever; and I don't care if it's a military 'thing' in a PG-13 film. The mild swearing is out of place. Some of the audience cheered and clapped when Michelle (signature frown and growl) Rodriguez says: \"You're not the only one with a gun, bitch!\" Why do women need to grow balls in these flicks.. You don't need to compete with the alpha male who is doing a fine job of cheapening the human race. It sounds great coming from Sigourney Weaver, in full control of a robot walker facing off against mother Alien, but it's not 'Aliens', it's Rodriguez with a pair who should stay in films that go straight to video shelf. I perceive that there is a reason behind the far too obviously staged overacting. It contrasts with the wonderful soothing, soul enriching acting from the Naa'ri. It also serves to exploit the human race for what they are: Takers, antagonists, butchers, and barbarians. Avatar is the current apotheosis of the reason we enjoy cinema. Anyone who is anyone can enjoy it, though preferably not younger children. Kids and adults alike who don't understand (or care about) the plot can get lost in the amazing world of Pandora.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, not something that should be missed on the biggest, most technically capable theater you can find. Can't be described, needs to be seen to be believed.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie has more visual 3D effects than any other i've seen so far. Some are subtle, some and the best looking ones jumps out at you. You get a sense of how awesome the effects are as soon as the main character steps into the jungle.<br/><br/>Storyline is the same thing as most would expect, and done before many times, so i really wasn't interested in it.<br/><br/>Acting was OK, but not great. I didn't really care for the characters, not much background about them was told in the story. But Cameron did quite a good job hiding them with visuals.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you want to see some great effects and visuals, this movie is for you. Story has been done, acting is sub par, music didn't knock my socks off. I must say, i was waiting for some wow moment to happen, but it never did. Remember to watch in 3D or you'll miss a lot of the gorgeous visuals.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The 3D is very clever, the CGI very pretty. But isn't a move actually about telling a story?<br/><br/>Avatar is indeed a film that could not have been made without 3D... because no-one would have watched it. Once you get past the pretty packaging what is left if possibly the most unoriginal, dull (yes dull), uninspiring, predictable film I have seen in years. I was bored. Once you have got used to the eye candy, its dull. <br/><br/>Take the standard plot from 100 cowboy and Indian films, add in the stereotypes from any Vietnam films (ideally the worst ones), dust down with some eco-greenery, and round off with any random action sequence to finish the film off. As a bonus add in the most unappealing, annoying \"hero\" you can imagine and you have Avatar. Really.<br/><br/>Its also a film whose plot makes no sense in so many ways. They are there to get hold of a mineral with a truly silly name whose purpose is never explained. They do not give a hoot for the indigenous wildlife and inhabitants. So why the crazy science stuff - if its so vital surely your stereotypical super-ruthless marine colonel would nuke the place from orbit, then take it? No - instead he flies in using helicopters - very 26th century, even my 13 year old son couldn't understand that one. All that was missing was a few comments concerning the pre-breakfast smell of napalm.<br/><br/>The plot holes are many, and Ms Weaver is still playing the same part she played in Alien - just worse - but its still probably the most rounded, convincing performance from any actor. There is a certain irony about a 3D film having such 1D acting.<br/><br/>The shocking thing, though, is that so many people are taken in by this dross - that does not bode well for the future of Hollywood films.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">One word that sums up almost every aspect of avatar. The hype, the actual movie and the ensuing debate. <br/><br/>The criticism grows more strident, the praise more lavish and both sides conscientiously question the others objectivity.<br/><br/>I lay no claim to perspective but here comes my two cents worth.<br/><br/>Overblown. The story and dialogue were totally devoid of subtlety or sophistication. All the ingenuity and imagination seem to have been saved for the technical wizardry and yet how ingenious was it. Apart from the extra leg or two the creatures are easily recognisable. The characters are decidedly humanoid, speak fluent English and even have familiar weapons. The two lead female tribeswomen look and sound like African American women down to the hand waving and head tossing. The trees and vegetation too are remarkably familiar.<br/><br/>Is this really the creation of a whole new world ? Slapping extra appendages and different colours on the known and familiar. Haven't star trek et al been doing this since half a century or so albeit in 2d.<br/><br/>The story is so predictable it defies belief, down to the hurt my girl/boyfriend and I will suddenly win a totally lost fight. There are no plot twists you cannot see coming within the first 5 minutes itself. There is no real depth of character or emotion. Yeah and whoo and what not make regular appearances in place of any truly moving words or speeches. After just the opening sequence of gladiator I was ready to don armour and kill a few Germans. After nearly three hours of this I just wanted to get home. This tale is truly pedestrian in both imagining and telling. <br/><br/>It seems in order to combat home theatres, bootlegging, p2p etc Hollywood seems intent on making movies that are simply too big to be seen anywhere but in a movie theatre. They have succeeded here because although I knew I would be disappointed I still bought a ticket to the \"Movie event of the year\". I don't regret it since it was okay as a one time watch, a curiosity. I did not hate it but i could never love it either. <br/><br/>Lang's turn as colonel was outstanding. One dimensional but the physique, voice and conduct was credible. Weaver, worthington and co did quite well given that most of the time they were spouting drivel. <br/><br/>I wish more had been done to elevate this movie above the usual special fx orgasm. <br/><br/>But like so many before it this film too has ended up being great movie-making and poor storytelling.<br/><br/>Thankfully at least gaming seems to be moving in the right direction and 2009 provided releases that are truly immersive experiences.<br/><br/>I will be buying a ticket for cameron's next release, hoping that the man who amazed me with terminator shows some flashes of his old self.<br/><br/>Thank you.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I have finally seen \"Avatar\" after two months into its release. Even so, the whole cinema was packed. Its success as the highest grossing film (not taking inflation into account) is highly understandable. It is in many ways the perfect popcorn movie - action, adventure, romance and a stirring score. The heroes are easy to like and the villains are easy to hate. The world created is enchanting and breathtakingly beautiful; every flower and plant and tree brims with beauty, and the use of motion capture is perhaps the best done so far.<br/><br/>As successful as the film may be, and no matter how many Oscar nominations and Golden Globe wins it may have, \"Avatar\" is however not without flaw. Its script often seems a bit secondary to the action and flashy graphics, and the film overall does go on for perhaps a bit too long, a problem that has plagued many a James Cameron film. Although the climax is truly exciting, the final act starts off quite poorly and it does become quite boring at this point. Equally, the level of myth creating does result in some somewhat unbelievable and ridiculous moments; the scene of Navi-mating did, quite frankly, leave me laughing a tiny bit.<br/><br/>Yet as imperfect as it may be, \"Avatar\" is overall a good film and worth watching - make sure you go and see it in 3D on the big screen before its run ends as well, as it truly gives the film a most fascinating scope.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Quite possibly the best movie ever made.<br/><br/>An amazing cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Cameron has painted his masterpiece(again).<br/><br/>The story works wonderfully from start to finish, but the story takes a backseat to the overall cinematography and the crafting of the individual shots. <br/><br/>The acting too, superb as it is, is overshadowed by the sheer genius of the film's creators.<br/><br/>Avatar will be enjoyed for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. <br/><br/>Technically it is probably the first of it's kind with myriad innovations behind the scenes that make for a seamless work of art.<br/><br/>And Avatar is truly a work of art. The kind of movie that will make you proud to be a member of the same species as those responsible for this celebration of humanity</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">There you have it, James Cameron's first film since \"Titanic\" summed up in five words. If I was Michael Blake, I'd sue him for everything he's got. With \"Aliens\", \"Terminator 2\" and \"Titanic\", Cameron wrote characters that were able to hold their own against the special effects. In this, they are all clichés that do not say or do one original thing. In Hollywood, it's inevitable that every big star has one pet project that they absolutely have to do, and it always sucks (look up a little film called \"Heaven's Gate\" if you don't believe me). I guess this one was his.<br/><br/>Is this film visually impressive? Yes, I'm not even going to argue that one; heck, it's a shoo-in for an Oscar (that's why it's getting a 2 rather than a 1). But Jim, can you do me a favor? Go see George Lucas and ask him about which is more important, special effects or the story and characters? But then again, if you do see him, he might just sue you for ripping off the third act of \"Return of the Jedi\".</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Spectacular,exciting, beautiful, unique,but the plot is pedestrian.it should have been better.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar with all technology, animation, 3D, or 3D Fusion Camera system that you see in the movie is awesomely and technically very sound movie and there are no two ways about it. He has done it before with Abyss, Aliens, Terminator, and Titanic. Awesome, beautiful visuals, with the 3D, you could actually feel that the fireflies, were just above your head or the ashes were falling on you. We fell in love with Pandora, we fell in love with a Na'vi tribe.<br/><br/>One of the first gentle visuals of the movie are a jellyfish structured floating in the crisp air of Pandora. This jellyfish took me to Abyss, like i have this one earlier. Couldn't have forgotten this movie at all, one of my first movie in Sterling and was feeling cold not only because of the air conditioner, but also the all the visuals were under water.<br/><br/>Having the infrastructure and the time in place, the first half of the movie keeps showing the different parts of the world of Pandora, huge and massive trees, flying mountains, again we go back to the visual elements, post which where is the story in the movie? Story has all the elements of climate change, love story, terrorism, forbidden love, out-of-the-world action, betrayal, but where is the Cameroon punch? I was shifting in my chair, looking around , just to realise that there were three people sitting beside me, who never came back, after the interval was over. There were just too many cuts / jumps in the movie, and one could easily realise this, hope this in only in the Indian version.<br/><br/>The creatures in the movie are again awesome, DireHorse, a horse with six legs and Banshee the flying dragon type of monster, which can only be tamed by confronting it. The cast was good, Sam Warrington did a decent job as the Avatar, than himself. Sigourney Weaver looked old, and there is gujarati scientist working for the AVATAR program Dr. Max Patel. Favourite character is the Colonel Miles Quaritch, the main antagonist.<br/><br/>Overall, visuals are brilliant, worth an Oscar, but the story was completely a miss!!</div>,\n",

It exemplifies why the French consider American films sophomoric and vacuous. The same story could be sold to a Saturday morning, cartoon show for the infantile. Maybe it was intended just for kids. <br/><br/>The effects were great, but the sci-fi elements were mostly mere fantasy. Pandora is a moon-planet apparently in orbit around a Jupiter-like planet which can only mean substantial time in pitch black darkness. Didn't Cameron consult anyone knowledgeable in science? It looks pretty to the eye but it embarrasses reason. Since so much attention to detail was shown regarding the technology used to project the neurological soul to an avatar, why any less detail given to celestial mechanics?<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the beginning scene depicting hyper-sleep technology almost caused a lost of bowel control, it was so awesome. <br/><br/>A Man Called Horse is a far better story of whitey eventually recognizing the far, far, far, far, far nobler characteristics of indigenous people. Maybe Avatar is today's representation of that idea. If so, it sure cost a lot more to get the same idea across. <br/><br/>The ceremonial dance by the natives reminded me of a MGM musical.

James Cameron used to be one of the best filmmakers to grace this planet, now he's just like all the others.... Just another money hungry grub who cares more about the massive paycheck than care about making a quality film. The quality of writing we got from him during the 80's and 90's was parallel to none, With Titanic the love story was perfectly written and perfectly integrated into the tragedy of the sinking ship, the first two terminators were superbly written and still are impressive to view even today and The Abyss is one of the best written Sci-Fi movies I've ever seen, but then comes Avatar which is just an animated remake of dances with wolves. And somehow this franchise has another FOUR MOVIES on the way. The film industry now is just one giant cash grab after another....</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Directed by the world-renowned James Cameron, after the major success of \"Alien\", and \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\", James Cameron has once more made an engaging science-fiction film, tackling issues of racism and conserving the rainforest/environment. The film is centered around Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) who plays the role of a paraplegic ex-marine, betraying and manipulating an alien species for human purposes. The film has spectacular visual effects, capable of standing-up to those of today; but, being pedantic, CGI is apparent during some scenes involving giant robots, which only slightly add to a dated feel. Despite this, interesting and developed characters with clear motives push the film along. The extent the Na'vi (the alien species situated on Pandora) are explored both emotionally and (especially) culturally propel the film to a new level, supported by an incredible setting, with apparent contrast of the industrialised human world to the vast landscape and jungles of Pandora. The hidden messages of equality and save-the-rainforest are subtly noticeable and add to the film.<br/><br/>Performances were good, but, unlike some films, the environment and messages were the film, not the star line-up (including Sigourney Weaver). \"Avatar\" is a truly interesting film, and a stepping-stone for not only science-fiction but motion capture films in the future.</div>,\n",

OK , the visuals are breath-taking , mind-boggling, absolutely amazing , and kudos to him for having engaged / commissioned the best and the brightest in the field, viz. ILM , Weta .etc. ,and the Oscars here are a given , but the idea of the movie – The Navis race , uncannily resembling the black Earthlings, on the distant Pandora , an Earth-like planet , living in total harmony with their planet and in direct communion with their ancestors , are to be wiped out by us , the ugly white - Christian – read – brutal – uncouth - dirty – and materialistic, egged on by the insatiable thirst for profits and profits alone , all encapsulated in the greedy boss in the form of G.Ribisi and ,who else but the ,again ,crazed military commander with an axe to grind with the Pandora's savages ? Am I to understand the message that this white brutal ugly Americans and oppressive western European males are always messing up with the ways of , say – Iraqis , Afgans or their separate tribal habits and heritage ,and foiling ,worse, desecrating their ' innocent 'ways, their absolute love they have always had for everyone ( Funny , I have never heard Soviets – e.g. Russian commies apologizing for their 'cultural ' proselytizing ?! ) .And the planet itself is teeming with life ,all again bearing a conspicuous resemblance to the one on Earth ,say ferns ,trees ,a sort of Jurrasic feel permeating the film , but I had expected to see some original,ugly ,Giger-like , terrifying forms and creatures ,but no dice ,it is a multi-million dollar investment ,and , kiddies , come in mighty droves ,it is your beloved hippo , a bit changed and coloured , and the horsey ,a bit changed and coloured , and there are dragons aplenty ,and they can be tamed ! Mr. Cameron should have followed his own gut-tearing Aliens , but ,alas, it is those ugly investors again ,demanding the cash torrent,not , god forbid , a trickle , so have no fear, kiddo ,and bring your mommies and sisters as well , we'll have fun ! The final battle is astounding ,but the Navis winning with spears and arrows against robotized walkers, jet helicopters and all sort of various mean-looking killing machines ,that's a long one , I really hoped they might throw dragons ' urine on soldiers ! All in all , a visually perfect Sci-Fi odyssey ,but erroneously based on the Gea's theory of the mother Earth , Al Gore's pseudo-scientific babble ( we had fouled up the Earth ,but lost on Pandora , and , sadly we are going back to the oceans of black and grey goo !) ,and I really wonder if there weren't some Greenpeace beatniks involved in this !

Mr. James Cameron's youngest \"Avatar\" is a mind-blowing adventure and the most impressive and intricate work of art, I've ever seen.<br/><br/>When his twin brother is killed, disabled ex-Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is recruited to aid a mining expedition on the distant jungle moon of Pandora as only his DNA will bond with the alien hybrid body, known as an Avatar, that allows humans to breathe the toxic air. With orders to infiltrate the Na'vi, Jake finds himself falling in love with native girl, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).<br/><br/>\"Avatar'\" was created twelve years ago by Cameron, but was ahead of its time. Cameron had to shelve the project and wait for technology to catch up to the script he had written. In 2005 Cameron thought he was close enough to push the technology to tell the story he always wanted to tell and went back to work. It cost Jim blood, sweat and tears and of course a lot of money, but the result is just fascinating, mesmerizing. Money well spent.<br/><br/>I am really happy that the movie turned out great. Not just for Jim's sake or because it had been a while since I'd seen a really good movie, but because of all the \"Avatar\" haters out there. All of those people who were trashing the movie before even watching it. They didn't give the movie a chance and let everyone believe that the movie was going to be really bad.<br/><br/>Well, they were all wrong and I hope they are honest enough to admit that. OK, maybe the love story wasn't really original, but it worked. However, if the story doesn't work for you, everything else will make up for it. When you watch the movie in 3D it becomes a transcendent and amazing experience that's the closest you will ever come to setting foot on a strange new world. The length of the movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes, but it looked a lot shorter. I wanted more. I just didn't want it to stop. It was that good.<br/><br/>I advise them and everyone to give the movie a chance and watch it the way it was mend to be watched, in 3D. You won't regret it! Oh yeah, I almost forgot. When you're watching the movie, it's completely normal to be attracted to Neytiri \n",

In terms of special effects, I am the only one not blown away, maybe I got a bad projection. But Lord of the Rings was similar so I don't see anything which blows you away. As a film it offers nothing to the film buff who is look for art on a screen. It is the same old tricks with 2009 technology. Input the old hero \"Great White Hunter\" script into the latest digital CGI software.<br/><br/>I think the film could have done better without the slow \"video log\" style start, it isn't keeping with the rest of the film. I don't know but the first 90 minutes or so was time to walk out. I liked the film after that boring video log nonsense which was anti- everything. U know in Alien when Weaver does the video log it really really sets the mode. \"This is Ripley Last survivor of the Something, with any luck the company will pick us up\" now that had mood and dept. I don't think Sam is the man, and I ll tell you why, take a look at all the greatest actors and I will tell you what they have in common—memorable faces. He has nothing in his face like Weaver, or Al Pacino, Denzel, or Snipes, you could have easily replaced with that English actor that plays Jedi Master Obekanobi. What is special about him, Will Smith would have been perfect and plus he is Black so he would relate to being Blue just that much more. I hope we see less of this Sam guy cuz even his acting is neither here nor there. But back to the technical stuff, the music was nonsense, I cant remember one single song or theme. Definitely not Aliens 3 for music. And the film is so predictable I must assume it is aimed at children.<br/><br/>Anyway beyond all of that I will still buy it on DVD because it has merit as an entry into cinema, not as much as the Matrix or 300 but still it makes an entry. Plus movies these days are so horrible that we the consumers are left with bad or badder.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"Avatar\" is not just a movie. As such it would be rather weak and declaratively inept. If you think it's about environmental issues, perils of corporate greed etc. ...it is not. If you think it's about good guys vs. bad guys \n",

If you are a mature male and find yourself surprised that tears are rolling down your face, it means that you got it. It's a rich and emotional experience. I have seen it twice in regular 3D and then in IMAX. That was yet another enhancement of the intensity of the immersion into the world of \"Pandora\" with its intertwined interconnectedness of the living beings of Flora and Fauna comprising the united divinity of Life.<br/><br/>Cameron seems to lift the name \"Pandora\" and it's natives from the Russian sci-fi authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. From The British Guardian newspaper: The Strugatskys call their world Pandora, and it is warm and humid and heavily forested. So is Avatar's alien world. The books take place in the 22nd century. So does Avatar... In the books, the natives of Pandora are called the Nave. Avatar calls its aliens the Na'vi. More from the Guardian: Strugatsky, 76, appears to have shrugged off suggestions of similarities between Avatar and his Noon Universe, and denied reports circulated that he was accusing Cameron of plagiarism.<br/><br/>This is not that important though. Avatar is a phenomenon and, in my opinion, everyone should see it.</div>,\n",

There were moments during the movie where my jaw dropped and I couldn't believe what I was looking at. This movie was an absolute visual stunner.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I was offended by how low brow the \"plot\" and dialogue was. UNOBTANIUM? Really? That's the best James Cameron could come up with? And I merely scratch the lameness surface with that little \"plot\" point. Every other line in the movie made me cringe. I couldn't help but think if a capable writer had contributed to this film it could have been an all time classic. Instead it will be remembered as the movie that could have been.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Let's face it, the only reason people watched this was for the effects. The plot was derived from dozens of other sources, with a half-hearted environmental message tacked on to give it some semblance of worth. Unfortunately, I find the effects tacky and unimpressive (I'm more of a practical effects fan myself, so this might not matter to you), and without that to impress the audience, it's little more than a multi-million dollar Fern Gully. I'd just watch Princess Mononoke instead, it's better written, and has about the same ratio of animation to live action as this.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The movie now is beyond reviews, It has broken all box office records. It shows the iniciative be getting people engaged with cinema again using 3d technology. The effects of the movie were really great enjoyed the whole film. I wouldn't say its the best movie I ever say, special effects don't engage all the passions on the viewer, you also need good acting and plot. But it is a work of art, very detailed during the whole movie, and by no means boring. Not a movie you would buy a pirate copy or download a torrent, you have to see it on the big screen in 3D or you really will not have seen the movie. It seems to have sparked a love-hate mindset, maybe those who hate it had too high expectations, I went to see it after hearing about it for 2 months and had to see what all the fuss was about, well it was well worth the money. This will be the start of many 3D productions bring people back to the cinema.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">So it's visually great and action filled. Yet nature documentaries also give me great shots of exotic places.<br/><br/>Somewhere they delved too much into the technical \"Let's make new visual sensations\" and forgot to make a story that would really capture our imagination.<br/><br/>As for the Na'Vi culture and Planet Pandora... during the film I had this constant impression that the director underestimates the public's intelligence. So he kept things nice and easy to understand. The aliens are basically North American native Indians transported to a night glowing jungle. Elves mixed with Indians... same hair cuts and weapons. The big bad Na'Vi guy even has the voice of the iconic native American actor Wes Studi ! They even have hands, nails and all sorts of human features. Basically blue big humans.<br/><br/>So does \"Pocahontas in space\" hold up ?! Kind of. Its fun. Its an eye full. In 3 years we won't remember this film anymore. Why ? Because it doesn't really grab my imagination. Still worth watching... but a better script writer and a bit more effort in making the Na'Vi really alien would have made this a true classic.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Normally this (sci-fi)would not be my kind of movie (leaving aside 2001: A Space Odyssey, but then Kubrick was a brilliant director). But the hype worked and I felt I had to see it.<br/><br/>The 3D imagery and the CG effects are, indeed, very impressive. The plot, however, is much less so and seems to be a familiar story seen before in the Wild West and elsewhere: noble native people ruthlessly exploited by technically sophisticated invaders, one of whom falls in love with a fair native maiden and helps the beleaguered savages to defeat - temporarily, perhaps - their tormentors. It all seems, well, a bit trite.<br/><br/>The movie is, however, entertaining. There's plenty of action - in fact rather too many battle scenes for me - and there's always anticipation of some even more magnificent visual display to come.<br/><br/>But guess what? We're supposed to be in the year 2154. Within minutes we see one of the main characters, Dr Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) ostentatiously smoking a good old-fashioned 20th century cigarette! How much did the tobacco corporations pay to achieve that piece of product placement? What are they trying to do? Convince today's kids that smoking will never die (even if they might as a consequence)? Probably 'yes'.That turned me off big-time.<br/><br/>So, worth seeing but more for appearances than meanings.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I first viewed \"Avatar\" from about mid-way back in the theatre, and I was simply overwhelmed with the anti-manifest destiny theme, the magnificent, ominous creatures, and Zoe Saldana's inspired performance and the CGI.<br/><br/>Stephen Lang portrays a tough, confident, field grade officer who walks the talk. At 57, he is in great physical condition, and he displays the grit and fanaticism of an old gunfighter slingshotted into the wild, dystopian future of human greed colliding with environmental harmony, far, far from planet earth.<br/><br/>I believed that Pandora could really exist and that smarmy, cynical bureaucrats may change their settings but never abandon their crude, ends-justify-the-means quests for more riches, more power, damn the consequences.<br/><br/>I hope that \"Avator\" proves to be even partially as influential as \"Star Wars\" was back in 1977.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I was looking forward to Avatar. I saw it on the second day it played and paid the extra money for the 3D. I enjoyed it, but it's far from the benchmark film some have been claiming.<br/><br/>First the motion-capture technology is fine when used to replicate body motion, but not facial expressions. It can duplicate basic broad facial movements, such as anger or laughter, but anything subtle is simply not there. You still relate to the alien characters as being animated and the earth characters as being real actors. We're obviously expected to not be aware of any difference between animated characters and real actors, but there is a substantial difference. <br/><br/>There is also a huge lack of original ideas for both technology and the creatures inhabiting the planet. Star Wars, Alien, 2001 A Space Odyssey or even going back to Fantastic Planet, gave the public technology and environments which had never been seen on the movie screen before. It's not that these films were absolutely original as they did borrow ideas. But when they did borrow, for the most part, they were not from other films and so it was new to the general public. Avatar just borrows too heavily from other movies we've all seen. For heaven's sake, did the bad guy REALLY have to get into one of those giant robotic suits for the climactic battle? Technologically, there is nothing in here that compares to the first time the public saw the space station wheel in 2001, or the H.R. Giger sets of Alien, or the giant planet walkers in Star Wars. Then there are the animals which inhabit the planet which look far too similar to earth animals. Basically, the alien tigers look like tigers and even the dinosaur-like creatures, well, look like dinosaurs! <br/><br/>And the action scenes, somehow didn't generate the excitement they should have. For example, when they were flying on the backs of the giant bird-creatures, I never felt the particularly thrilled by it. A flying scene like that should have made you feel a sensation of vertigo. I was thinking that it might have been because the jungle environment was so strange and foreign that you had no sense of height the way you would in a city scene when buildings give your mind something to relate to. But I think there may have been a bigger reason. Greater importance was given to hammering home the message of the film, rather than simply being caught up in the action. So, flying on the backs of the birds was to show \"the majesty of the natural world\" instead of just the thrill of it. And the battle scenes were not the battle scenes in a Star Wars film, because it simply more important to feel the sorrow and horror of war. Compare the actions scenes in Avatar to Dark Knight and there is no comparison. <br/><br/>The only place Avatar excels is in the depth and detail of the planet. The jungle is probably the star of the movie. However, I could just go to an Imax showing of the real Amazon jungle and get the same experience.<br/><br/>If you keep your expectations reasonable, you'll probably enjoy Avatar. But this isn't the new Star Wars.</div>,\n",

I love the relationships between the characters, and it's fun to see all the action in 3-D. Some of the stuff didn't even look like it was made in a computer. The Na'vi are also some of the most convincing creatures ever on film. They are sort of a cross between smurfs, cats, and Native Americans.<br/><br/>Overall, Avatar is just....awesome!

But somehow they managed to turn such a beautiful story upside down and up its own ass with hippy environmental junk spewing out its mouth. <br/><br/>Having good Effects is insufficient, in 30 years, all movies will have that, and this movie will just be a bad memory. The acting is horrid, if that... <br/><br/>The best part about the action, is the build up to the action, its like listening to Carmina Burana and just halting it when its about to go to the epic choir.</div>,\n",

Like Titanic and T2 before it, it's the most expensive film ever made and every cent of it is up there on the silver screen in amazing 3D.<br/><br/>Paraplegic Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) arrives on the fertile planet of Pandora and builds up trust with the native people through an avatar which enables him to become a nine-foot blue cat-like alien (sounds plausible!).<br/><br/>The Na'vi, the tribe Sully comes into contact with, have a little bit of everything in their creation; a hint of Native American (Mohican haircuts, bows and arrows), a dash of Jamaican (dreadlocks and a slight Jamaican accent) and some African tribal designs used in their costumes and jewellery.<br/><br/>As with the Irish immigrants in \"Titanic\", Cameron is again on the side of the oppressed underdog in \"Avatar.\" The villains in \"Avatar\" are greedy, genocidal strip-miners who want to steal the rich mineral deposits of Pandora for themselves (note the similarity with the grabbing of oil in Iraq). Cameron reveals his true colours as an old hippie with this ecologically-correct, anti-war movie (surprising for a man who nuked and shot up everything in sight in the 80s with \"Aliens\" and \"The Terminator\" with all their close-ups of gleaming hardware and phallic guns dispensing empty shell casings all over the place, I guess old JC is growing up).<br/><br/>There are also nods to other movies including Predator and Last of the Mohicans.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver reunites with Cameron here for the first time since \"Aliens\" in 1986 and it's always good to see her on screen even if it is a little sad to see one of your childhood heroes getting older.<br/><br/>Once again, James Cameron creates a warrior woman to sit alongside Ellen Ripley in \"Aliens\" or Sarah Connor in \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\" She is called Neytiri (played through the magic of CGI by black actress Zoe Saldana).<br/><br/>Sam Worthington is better here than he was in \"Terminator: Salvation\", but the jury is still out on him as an actor. He seems to lack the charisma that the really great stars have. Only time will tell if his Hollywood career has legs.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" is a long film, but it is enjoyable. As with all 3D movies, there are some scenes you just feel were put in to show off the technology and they do seem to go on a little long but the staggering final battle just about makes up for any earlier flaws. Once again James Cameron has pushed the boundaries of what is possible in cinema and that can only be a good thing. What will he think of next?</div>,\n",

This is a great story!--- this is sci-fi on a very high level. Is the story less than novel?----what stories aren't rehashes and blendings of other story lines...? This is a morality tale with good and bad very clearly drawn. It is a disavowal of technology and the greed that drives profit and power, and an extraordinary affirmation of the organic world, the vegetative and animal forces that constitute life.<br/><br/>Others will comment at greater length of Cameron's rejection of man's attempt to conquer the universe by technologically violent means-----this is not that different a view than the one that drove John Borman's tale of the Brazilian native people's lives being destroyed by the advancing bulldozers in \"The Emerald Forest\"----but more than that it focuses on the incapacity of those blinded by greed who cannot empathize with the sufferings of those they are harming. Cameron again is not inventing anything new, but taking a very old human story to very powerful heights. George Carlin would have loved this movie. It attacks some people as shallow and mechanistic, cruel and barbaric, narcissistically destructive... after seeing war movies for years of humans killing one another I must agree with Cameron.<br/><br/>At one point the Na'vi are called \"blue monkeys\" by the humans..... human hubris denigrating non-human lifeforms. At another point the idea that there would be sacred areas to the Na'vi is laughed at by the corporate mercenaries------as if spirituality is either non-existent or only a human trait. Yet in Cameron's world the profit-hungry humans have no concept of God or spirituality at all----they are as soulfully dead as the machines they climb into----while those who live sans technology are very strongly spiritual. They are the essence of spiritual beings fully in touch with the life streaming through and around them.<br/><br/>Good v bad. Mechanical worldview v pantheism. Pro-life v anti-life. Cameron's movie isn't about inventing these themes, only the way he portrays them with amazing beauty and boldness. <br/><br/>I cannot say enough about the grandiosity of this cinematic effort. It is not only groundbreaking, but the first major step into the next wave of visual entertainment. The glasses-aided 3-D is superb, entrancing. The blend of CGI and actors is as seamless as the sky . . . will this lead to 3-D in home cinema, in TV broadcasting? Cameron is marking a trail that others will undoubtedly carve more completely. Tomorrow is bright with promise.<br/><br/>Thank you, James Cameron. I love sci-fi when it is done well, and with \"Avatar\" you have done it as well as can be imagined, and better than anyone else previously has. <br/><br/>A beautiful and timeless movie, \"Avatar.\"<br/><br/>I look forward eagerly to your future offerings.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Yes, I was able to see an advanced screening of James Cameron's long awaited science fiction film, Avatar.<br/><br/>So, what's good about it? The visuals are among the best ever seen, the planet Pandora truly comes alive, and the creatures, wildlife, etc. All look fabulous on the big screen.<br/><br/>What's bad about it? Cameron's trademark lame dialog is back, as well as his less than ordinary scriptwriting. The characters, with the exception of Signorey Weaver's scientist character, and Stephen Lang's Colonel Quarritch all feel wooden. The hero doesn't feel alive, he feels generic, and I felt the bad guys \"humans\" were cardboard caricatures. Not to mention the story is far from original. It's basically Dances With Wolves/ Pocahontas meets Aliens.<br/><br/>What's the story about? <br/><br/>(SPOILERS AHEAD!) <br/><br/>In the future, Marine soldier, Jake Sully, (Played by Austrailian Sam Worthtington) is a paralyzed veteran, whose twin scientist brother was killed. The Resources Development Association, a greedy energy corporation, similar to the one used in Cameron's Aliens film gives him an opportunity to take his brother's place in the Avatar program designed by the RDA to infiltrate the natives of Pandora called the Navi, who stand ten feet tall, have blueish skin and act like Native Americans, plus they speak English. (What a surprise!) The RDA have brought in a group of marines led by the evil Colonel Miles Quarrich, easily the most interesting character of the entire film, to make sure that the Navi are displaced from their home so that the RDA can extract a mineral called \"Unobtainium\", which is worth $20,000,000 an ounce, since the Earth is in an energy crisis. <br/><br/>The film has some of the greatest visuals ever recorded on film, but after a while your eyes can get a little exhausted from seeing every little detail in 3D. After Jake's introduction to the Navi by \"driving\" his Avatar body, the film slows down as Jake and his new found love, Neitri, played by Zoe Saldana, fall in love, and Jake discovers how the Navi tribe works. But, time is running short, Quaritch and the RDA want to displace the Navi, by force if necessary, to mine the unobtainium from the Navi grounds.<br/><br/>The ending involves marine equipment of every sort, gunships, robotic suits, etc, all while the Navi face them down with flying dragons, dinosaurs, bows, arrows, etc. It's one of the grandest visual effects scenes ever put on film.<br/><br/>All in all, how did I feel about this film? Well, it's certainly an improvement over Cameron's previous entry Titanic, but his clunky dialog, and shoddy storytelling are still present, and most of the characters really aren't fleshed out very well. Worthington's Sully doesn't really feel alive, Saldana's Neitri is basically Sully's Navi love interest with little to do. Giovani Ribisi's greedy corporate shrill, Parker Selfride, is a whiny irritant, and Michelle Rodriquez, plays a sympathetic marine pilot who does little in the film. Only Weaver's Dr. Grace Augustine and Stephen Lang's Quarritch stand out among the crowd. Where Cameron succeeds is in the technical aspects of the film, the visuals, by Peter Jackson's effects company WETA digital, are first rate. Also, most of the action feels unoriginal since we have seen a lot of this material in Cameron's far superior Aliens film. Plus, it never even comes close to reaching the heights of his best film, 1991's Terminator 2 Judgement Day. Plus as I said earlier the dialoge is borderline retarded, hearing lines out of Quaritch's mouth is so bad, I was hoping for some cotton balls for my ears every time I heard one of his annoying speeches. Not to mention the logical thing for the RDA to have done was to negotiate with the Navi for the unobtainium instead of taking it by force, but then again, Cameron doesn't want to use logic, he sees corporations as the ultimate evil. Very little gray in this film. The RDA is evil and the Navi are good, end of story.<br/><br/>Would I see this again? Maybe, maybe not, but the slower aspects of the film and some of the dialog are very irritating to listen to. My wife actually got a migraine headache from wearing those 3D glasses for over two and a half hours.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, the visuals shine, the story lags, and the dialog is awful.<br/><br/>Avatar is not bad, but not great either. I would say it's average.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">First of all, I was shocked to see that here in my country (Portugal), this was classified for persons aged of six years and over. It is very disappointing to assist such a pathetic marketing move for the expansion of this movie's reputation, when it's, I say, strong violent content isn't anywhere appropriate to kids aged of six and I don't think they would even understand a film like Avatar.<br/><br/>Having said this little parenthesis, let's talk about James Cameron's latest piece of work and that cost him approximately fourteen years of his life to produce. I think it is fair to report that 'Avatar' is today one of the GIANTS in what we like to call 'Cinematic Experience'.<br/><br/>After seeing (the classic) Terminator movies, (the so-so) Titanic and testifying all the buzz around this movie, I must say my expectations were right and I knew what I was in it for. Turns out to be, 'Avatar' is a precious gem and a brilliantly meticulous and detailed 3D spectacle with a lot of action from the beginning to the end. Even with a plot that wasn't something from the other world, but competent I must admit, this movie exceeds the limits of possible and let us have a wide look on Cameron's genius mind and imagination. The whole movie is fantastic and Zoe Saldaña is very sexy, even if she's blue!<br/><br/>That's it. An epic and instantly legend in the visual department, this is without a doubt a classic in it's genre. Perfect for a Saturday night trip to the theater and best served with a lot of popcorn's and Coca-Cola, 'Avatar' is guaranteed fun in a magical three hours of length and one of those traditional movies that are probably to leave a legacy of 'geeks' worshiping this movie, forever. Action lovers, sci-fi lovers, James Cameron lovers, this IS your movie - 9/10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">We have only one complaint about this movie. Many good reviews have already been written here...many also are spoilers which is a shame. The experience should not be spoiled by anything other than ones own imagination which, for this film is not difficult. It does not take much predicting to preceded the story in your mind as you watch. Very few surprises are written into the story but that in NO WAY takes away from the power of the story. All a viewer needs to know before hand are what is presented in story synopsis which do not reveal the ending or resolution of any number of conflicts that arise in a good story. We compare the impact of this movie to that of the Lord of the Rings. The fantasy creatures become very believable very quickly and give the viewer a sense of being among them. We completely forgot all the hype about the animation and effects and watched the film in 3D (highly recommended) as if we were watching life action. Our only complaint is in the casting of Sigourney Weaver. She does not have the ability to act beyond her past roles. Alien clings to her like irremovable paint. The film excelled in finding so many good actors that were not beset by past roles. Putting Sigourney Weaver in the role she plays could only be compared to casting Nicolas Cage instead of Sam Worthington and John Travolta instead of Steven Lang. Thank goodness Cameron had the sense not to do that.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is that kind of movie that heavily (if not entirely) relies on the visual entertainment and the inventive creation of an environment, but the plot is so incredibly unoriginal that without the huge support of visual effects, the whole film would be branded as horse****. It's \"Pocahontas\" set in a sci-fi context, that's a pretty accurate comparison to make.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">When the filmmaker behind the highest-grossing film of all-time takes twelve years off to develop his next film, the bar is set pretty high. Titanic's Jim Cameron set out to revolutionize movies with immersive 3-D technology which promised to be unlike anything audiences had ever seen. Since its release, Avatar has drawn enormous crowds; word-of-mouth and repeat viewings have lead, within a mere twenty days, to its claiming the title of 2nd-highest grossing film of all time worldwide.<br/><br/>Some conservative groups have blasted what they believe is the film's environmental extremism, with the Vatican's film critic saying that it worships creation instead of the Creator. Others have blasted it for perceived racism, with the \"white savior\" rescuing indigenous peoples. Some have said that the film is anti-military. Most claim, however, that it is simply great entertainment. In my opinion, the truth of all these claims is somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>Regular readers may notice that I almost never divulge any plot information in my reviews. I don't like to read reviews that give away large chunks of narrative; I've never felt it was the critic's job to tell me the story, and I'll pay you the same courtesy. I will say, first and foremost, that the film is neither the political lightning rod some have made it out to be, nor is it worthy of the hype and box-office its receiving (I can think of many movies that deserve a wider audience). It is, however, constantly entertaining and artistically stunning.<br/><br/>Everything you've heard about the visuals is true. This is not CGI (computer-generated images) for just for the sake of it, nor is the 3D merely a gimmick. Cameron has succeeded in created a completely immersive new world. These are not special effects; this is art. The 3D serves to truly make viewers feel as if they were on a glorious foreign planet, with its own ecosystem and amazing wildlife.<br/><br/>Likewise, Cameron knows how to stage action, and the adventure/combat sequences are truly thrilling. The narrative is fine, but not as impressive. The derivative script borrows heavily from Dances With Wolves, Disney's Pocahontas, The Last Samurai, Ferngully: The Last Rainforest, and even Return of the Jedi.<br/><br/>Though the heroes are interesting enough, the villains are mostly one-dimensional. Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver do fine work, as do several others, but the only truly exceptional acting is by Zoe Saldana (Star Trek) who plays the princess of an alien tribe. Her work, via motion capture, conveys rich, tender, and savage emotion. So skillfully does she portray both the humanity and the strangeness of an imaginary race that the audience connects with her more than any of the human characters. She, and the rest of the alien tribe, are utterly convincing.<br/><br/>As for the controversy, the film does take a strong stance about protecting and conserving the environment. The claim by the Vatican's movie critic, that the film worships creation instead of the Creator, could be valid if it weren't so obviously fantasy. Its theology works in its imagined universe the same as The Force does in Star Wars.<br/><br/>I take a more moderate stance than the film does on conservation, as it paints those who mine natural resources as greedy at best and evil at worst. That said, any message about honoring and preserving nature is worthwhile. Also, On a different level, the story can be enjoyed by those who see it as a tale of a group nobly defending their homes, wives, children, and beliefs from those who seek only to conquer.<br/><br/>The claims of racism are, I think, unfounded. Like The Last Samurai, Pocahontas, and Dances With Wolves, Avatar takes a narrow-minded white man, immerses him in a foreign environment, and allows him a change of heart as he comes to appreciate the culture and way of life of his enemy. Unoriginal maybe, but hardly racist.<br/><br/>Because the story and characters are only moderately engaging, Avatar fails to live up to the hype. However, as an action film and a soulful artistic achievement, it is a terrific work that ought not to be missed.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It was a great movie which made me think about aboriginal people.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">SPOILER ALERT! The story line of this movie is basically this, soldier goes to infiltrate a native people/tribe to spy on them by unscrupulous commanders/employer, soldier comes to sympathize with the tribal people and changes sides to fight his own people, sound familiar? Then think of The Last Samurai/The Mission etc in outer space and you get the idea of the direction of the story, not to say the movie doesn't do it well, but its been done so many times before. The cast as a whole are solid but a little too predictable, you can tell which character will fill which role just by looking at them, you know right away Sam Worthington will be the hero, Stephen Lang the villain etc. Away from the repetitive plot and predictable characters, the visual effects of the movie are some of the best I've ever seen, Pandora is stunning, poisonous atmosphere aside, the wildlife is actually believable as are the Na'vi as an intelligent life form from another world. If you like great special effects and stunning visual imagery, this movie is for you, but don't expect an original plot with any surprises.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Jake Sully joins a military operation on the foreign planet Pandora after his twin, who was working on the project, dies. The military is attempting to move the natives off their land so they can colonize and use the land for their own purposes. Jake must use a computer program that allows him to control the body of one of these aliens so he can infiltrate their culture and coerce them to move their homes. <br/><br/>I am AMAZED at how much critical acclaim Avatar is receiving. Aside from the visuals, which are at times stunning, this is one of the most predictable and clichéd big budget movies I have seen in a long while. Every, and I mean every little twist and turn of the plot you can see coming a MILE away.<br/><br/>-There's one flying thing that no one has ever ridden before: I wonder if that's going to pay off at all <br/><br/>-Jake prays to the \"tree gods\" for help in the fight: I wonder if their going to help in someway, no they'll probably end the movie with the natives losing and the military slaughtering all of them <br/><br/>-They are trying to save Sigourney Weaver by putting her soul into her Avatar: I wonder if their going to use that later to create one the cheesiest everybody wins happy endings ever<br/><br/>Worse than the obvious plot points though, would have to be the ridiculously, almost comically one dimensional characters. Let's see they got the everyman, the evil heartless military commander, the non caring rich businessman, the sassy cool female character (several), the nerdy uncool friend, and probably a few more I'm forgetting. <br/><br/>I was also very annoyed that it perpetuated the conceited sentiments of movies like The Last Samurai and Dances With Wolves. A white American human walks into an alien culture and in five minutes he's \"Aw Shucked\" his way into becoming the most important being of their species. One day he joins the culture, the next day he is giving speeches to them and receiving help from a god that hasn't answered their prayers up to this point. The movie portrays it as if without the help of lovable old Jake Sully their culture would have been wiped out.<br/><br/>I also wasn't blown away by the 3D. Yeah, it was far superior to any 3D that has been available up to this point, but SO WHAT. It was cool to look at for the first 15 minutes or so and then I wanted a better movie to watch. <br/><br/>Avatar isn't completely devoid of charm however. Most of the action scenes are exciting and well designed as far as that goes, and it has a fairly clever if extremely derivative story.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I can not wait for part two, this movie is brilliant!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I can't honestly say I am a huge James Cameron fan (Lucas and Spielberg hold that honor) but his movies never cease to give you more of what you want out of movies, an escape from the every day. Avatar does just that, takes you on one wild far out ride. The graphics are amazing; I was seriously sitting there trying to figure out what was real and what was not. It's hard, because it all fits together so seamlessly that you actually believe that Pandora exists and that you could really go there. Even the aliens looked real; the Sigourney Weaver Avatar LOOKED JUST LIKE Sigourney Weaver. Like she was wearing makeup or something like that. And let's be honest, who hasn't wanted to see Sigourney Weaver as an 8 foot tall blue alien? But this also made me think that if we have this type of technology now just think of what we could do!? Chris Farley in a movie with Humphrey Bogart? Who knows? The possibilities are limitless! Leave it to the creator of the Terminator to come up with this. This movie WILL change the way all future movies are made, of that there is no doubt.<br/><br/>But as I watched a few things came to my mind that bothered me and I hope you will indulge me for a moment.....<br/><br/>#1-Why is it that every movie that uses the military uses them as bad guys who are hell bent on killing and blowing things up? Once the main Colonel came on screen I said \"There's your 'Bad Guy'\" He fit the typical stereo type of military in movies to a T. Too over the top of you ask me, like a cartoon villain.<br/><br/>#2-So the main brother dies and they decide to bring in the twin brother Jake to take his place, with no background information or training for this mission? This guy has no idea what he's doing, so what would the odds be of him getting there and being killed after the first day cause he had no idea what to expect? If the Avatars were so expensive you think they would spend more time to train him so he lives and gets the job done instead of throwing him into it and hoping for the best.<br/><br/>#3-So this mineral is important, I get it, and they want it bad I get that too. But with the technology that the humans have why didn't they just dig under the tree? Why bother the locals if they are so hell bent against you? Use the Avatars to mine the mineral behind the locals backs and your problem is solved.<br/><br/>#4-Michelle Rodriguez's character.....I get she was the 'Ripley' of the movie. But why is the 'rebel chick who will save the day' always the one in the tight fitting and rather revealing outfit? Also, half the things she wore cannot possibly be regulation military wear, if it is I wanna join.<br/><br/>#5-Why did this corporation have the military there anyway? It was not a military operation, and you have big bulldozers that would easily crush the locals, so why bother with the Jarheads? <br/><br/>#6-There was no plot. Sorry, but it's true. This was pretty much Dances with Wolves like everyone says. You can see it coming a million miles away. The first 20 minutes into Avatar and I knew where it was going. It was awesome to see and experience, but there was no reason to really be there.<br/><br/>#7-Thank god they had that mind transferring tree thing, because Jake alienates himself from the humans to live with the locals. Hate to tell you Jake but you are still a guy in an Avatar body, what kind of life would you have living two lives? Would your human body really be able to take that for a long extended period of time? Did you think that through? #8-Seriously, was all the bombs and blowing up stuff REALLY needed? There had to be another way. That was too much. Committing genocide for some rocks? Dear lord, what will we become? Please tell me this is not because of global warming.<br/><br/>There are others but just minor nitpicks from me and I won't bother you with them.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Avatar is an experience like no other, but you need to leave the rational part of your mind at the door, this is the type of movie that takes you away to another place but refuses to answer your questions when you're done.<br/><br/>And that's all we want now a days anyway, a movie that will take us away from reality for a while.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is without a doubt the worst ripoff-remake ever ,i can't believe that no one else has notice, so what do we have here?, OK let's see, the space travel, the remote unexplored world, the hibernation, the hostile extraterrestrials, the marines, the robot suits, Sigourney Weaver!!!! come on!!!! it sounds familiar to you? ....sure it is familiar, it sounds like....Aliens(1986) from James Cameron. Mr Cameron committed plagiarism but not only with his own work, the script about a soldier who betrayed his own people has nothing of new or original, it is the same premise that The last Samurai (2003) from Edward Zwick, or dances with wolves (1990) from Kevin Costner, so what's new here? only the visual effects that are in fact state of the art....Cameron let us debt after all these years since Titanic, he has no new ideas, only better special effects</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I just saw the 3D version of this movie today and I'm still blown away. Is there anything James Cameron can't do?? The actors were wonderful! They are able to transcend the CGI and give touching, believably intense performances. <br/><br/>The movie was so hyped that I went into it expecting to be disappointed. Nothing can be THAT good, right? Read my lips...It is better than good. It's better than awesome. It is genre, medium, and industry changing. It just is.<br/><br/>Like many other viewers I forgot I was watching CGI. Everything is vividly, eye-poppingly alive. Pandora LIVES...it breathes and you believe it all! The interaction between live-action and CGI is seamless. The world is so immersive...it has an almost 360 degree quality. You feel as if you could turn around and see everything happening around you. It's like you are plunked down in the middle of this very real place.<br/><br/>The Na'vi were a concern when I was sitting in the theater waiting for the show to start. Would they disappoint? Would they be buffoonish (a'la JarJar Binks)? Would they be believable? From the first frame the aliens are real. They are beyond cool. They are alive. They are righteous and they are fierce! They are not comic relief.<br/><br/>You must see this movie and you absolutely MUST see it in 3D.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">So for once it is us, the Humans, who invade another planet! Tired of these powerful aliens who come and wreck our planet and treat us like vermin. For once, stress that comes from the prospect of being eliminated and toyed with is not on us.<br/><br/>Just for that this inter-galactic action adventure is worth a view.<br/><br/>As someone noted, this movie is not a deep intellectual exercise.<br/><br/>The themes are all old and one could say this movie had elements from movies such as \"Dances with Wolves\" (Soldier switches sides once he is exposed to the enemy and empathizes with them), \"10000 BC\" (Walk through the jungle with dangerous exotic creatures everywhere), \"Apocalypto\" (The warriors), \"Last of the Mohicans\" (The jungle, the warriors, the native tribes, the romantic vibe\", and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>There have even been Star Trek Next Generation episodes, where the space-ship was actually a living creature! So from that perspective there really was nothing new. What was new was what I noted above, for once we get to be the aggressors, albeit the evil ones. Feels good to be superior in technology to at least one alien entity.<br/><br/>The Navi people are shown to be child like Innocent in one sense, very spiritual as well as they are one with nature, but also brutal in the sense on moments notice the leader of the tribe was going to decide whether the \"Avatar\" lives or not.<br/><br/>What is hard to believe is that human consciousness and morality would reverse going forward. With all the opposition and Wars to invasions, unless the \"un-obtanium\" was curing some kind of plague, it is impossible for me to believe that humans in general would turn away from private looters raiding and brutalizing this alien world. One could draw a comparison to Halliburton led wars to acquire oil, but it is not really same. Navi would have to have done something horrible to humans, in order for even looters to come up with justification for uprooting and brutalizing them. Since they are incapable of threatening Earth, such a case would have been hard to make.<br/><br/>I also feel, no matter what, the way Navi recognized that 'Avatars' were in their words, \"souls in false bodies\", they would be so comfortable with the idea and just accept them, and the leader of the tribe would appoint his daughter to educate the 'Avatar' in their way of life. Why? Why wouldn't they believe they are spies and here to endanger them? Anyhow, James Cameron knows how to make the movie exciting enough for us to enjoy and want to see it multiple times! Good entertainment value and gives something to think about, even though it doesn't have emotional content to move you, it is thrilling enough to enjoy and a visual spectacle!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The first time I saw this film I was 4 or 5 years old when my father put the movie on dvd and I'll never forget it.

An interesting story is always controversial and disturbing. And thus risky. And that is exactly how the story is. Predictable to the very last second, good and bad neatly sorted out.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the filmmakers added a moralic momentum. Every fairy tale, every archetypal story is simply about good and bad struggling with each other. Just have a look at good old Star Wars.<br/><br/>Avatar is a lot worse, good is obviously American indians, but pretty ecological, and in deep love with gaia. While white American men, members of the military industrial complex, are out there to destroy everything. I am simply too old and by far not dumb enough to buy that crap.<br/><br/>The pictures are brilliant. Especially the 100% computer generated ones. While live action has some difficulties in 3D, CGI is just plain perfect. Even though Pixar is a serious rival in technological excellence, pixar does not have the money to produce almost 3 hrs of highly detailed landscape. <br/><br/>But that is money only! The extremely convincing animation of the alien characters is the most impressive feature in Avatar. In fact, it is the only real new feature. You could have seen everything else in other movies, not that exhaustive though.<br/><br/>Avatar is impressive, a must see. But ultimately it is a mindless piece of film.

Hadn't they seen Dances with Wolves yet ? Weren't there sufficient characters in DwW to steal? Let us count the ways this script was pabulum<br/><br/>1. usual sexist, racist Hollywood PC BS. Every white guy is evil except two. Jake, who really has to turn into a blue-guy to stop being evil &amp; the other scientist/avatar, who was not evil but was basically incompetent at everything &amp; really a non-event in the script. Otoh, there is a female &amp;/or minority \"doing the right thing\" everywhere we look. How uplifting! I guess there must not be many theaters in China yet, since none of the \"good guys\" were Chinese. There's 6 billion or something people waiting to be pandered to. <br/><br/>2. about 1/3rd of the way thru, I said to myself \"I'll bet jake &amp; the evil security guy will end the movie in hand-to-hand combat. I'm hoping he gets impaled on a hot steam pipe &amp; the steam keeps coming out, like in some Governator movie.\" ... Check! Though, I will give it a minor award for creativity b/c it wasn't actually jake versus the evil guy. It was Jake's mental avatar versus the evil guy's mechanical robot/avatar. Nice little touch. But killed by arrows? Cowboys &amp; indians comes to the 2010s. <br/><br/>3. when the battle started turning against the \"good guys\", I said to myself \"I'll bet the trees will come save them, like in LotR.\" Check minus! I was close. It wasn't the plant-life but the animal-life. Wow, so unique. I'll bet P. Jackson is blue with envy. <br/><br/>4. Lest we forget the really dumb suppositions, (I'm sure there is a better cinematic term but unlike most imdbers, I never flunked out of film school) how about when we see Jake having meetings with the evil white guy(s) during the day or taping his thoughts during the day. So, what is his avatar doing, napping? \"Hey, wake up blue dude. It's 2 in the afternoon.\" Oh, maybe he did most of it at night? Right, the guy lived on 2 hrs sleep/day. <br/><br/>And then there's the idea that the indigenous blueies, who are supposed to be the paragon of simple virtues, who innately understand good versus evil, real versus fake, etc. will open their arms and take as one of their own a freakin avatar, a dreamwalker. The blue chief-to-be, you know, one of the ones who came over from DwW, said it correctly early on ... \"he's a demon in a fake body.\" that is exactly right. The blue paragons of virtue would have accepted him about as much as they would have accepted having a McDonalds built at the foot of their hometree. Crikey.<br/><br/>Random thought ...

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">If special effects were the essence of movie-making, Cameron's fantasy \"Avatar\" might have been a film of value. However, this movie amazes the viewer with the complete lack of original ideas in its story-telling. We have almost half a billion dollars spent on a cheesy story, padded with political correctness and an annoying imposition of some mixture of neo-paganism, spiritualist environmentalism and Wicca-goddess worship. The preaching of the weird religious beliefs is in your face and relentless: besides the time spent on rituals and chanting, we even have a conversion-scene of a hard scientist to the religion of the planet's natives. And these \"Navi\" beliefs are good-old jungle \"boogie\" mixed up with some mother-earth nonsense.<br/><br/>Freakshow. The natives of the planet are \"humanoid\" yet not exactly human. Besides \"taking you into another world\", the choice of the \"race\" for the natives is quite offensive. They are a bigger version of humans with some elf-like features, vampire fangs, and the facial expressions of an ant-eater. We should not forget the proverbial tail – evolution has taken its own turn on the planet. The special visuals may make entering this world of Cameron's unobtrusive but the sense of mixing these creatures with humans is still unnerving to the viewer. And let's not forget – the color blue for the skin is only a little step away from the usual green-gray color of aliens.<br/><br/>The bad guys are the white males of military discipline and corporate greed. The good guys are the tribal planetary humanoid underdogs, and the breakaway humans sympathizing with the native's cause. The story telling is good as it follows the classical secrets of the trade. But the sheer length of it and the indulgence in special visuals makes it rather boring and lacking depth.<br/><br/>\"Borrowing\" from other movies is heavy. In it we sense the strain of Cameron's imagination to overcome its boundaries, set by his own liking, experience and pretensions. The film is a mixture which borrows from \"The Matrix\" (entering another world through a heavily-wired coffin), \"Apocalypto\" (kill the beast but apologize – after all, it is your brother), Count Dracula (the native's have protruding fangs), \"Star Wars\" (much shooting on a large scale in a strange planetary environment); \"The Glimmer Man\", with Steven Segal (Bad, bad company, digging for treasure under my house!); \"Dances with Wolves\" (I must become one of them.); \"Aliens\" is also present (some of the animals open their nasty mouths in the same way as the main beast of that movie).<br/><br/>This is an annoying and preachy film which, thanks to the enormous budget and mass-marketing, has become yet another blockbuster-symbol of human moral and intellectual limitations. Good movies are not just special effects wrapped up in New Age spirituality; but who am I to say that to the king of the world?</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The message behind Avatar is a noble one, but that doesn't go far enough to cover up the unimaginative storyline and dialogue. Avatar is heavy on clichés that we've seen plenty of times before: Hero goes to a strange land and isn't accepted by the natives. Fast forward 45 minutes and he's finally been accepted into their inner circle. Inevitably he will find someone there that he falls in love with at first sight. Their love will be endangered by the enemy that seeks to harm the natives in some way or other. And so on and so on. You can pretty much predict everything that's going to happen within the first 20 minutes, which is remarkable considering the running time is well past 2 and half hours.<br/><br/>I give it a 5/10 based solely on it's visual merits and recognition for the amount of effort it takes to put something on this large of a scale together. That in itself is admirable. I just wish that there was actually some substance to back the film up.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'll admit that I was expecting a lot from this movie. I had heard about the huge budget and effort required to create it and had heard that it was a landmark movie that was going to take the movie business to a new level. I didn't like the movie at all. It was a trite straightforward drama with colorless characters, recycled elements, WOW factors we've seen before and a weak \"showdown\" climax.<br/><br/>Ground breaking CGI: Big deal. I don't know about 10 year old kids, but I've seen so much CGI, for so long, that it's simply boring. Yes the glowing flowers and such were beautiful (even if the dandelion seeds were overused), but so what? Movies are best about things in our real world, like courage, loyalty and friendship. Glowing flowers are nice but can't carry a movie.<br/><br/>Too many recycled elements from Aliens, Terminator, Star Wars, and Transformers: Weaver, cybersleep, the loaders, the veloci-copters, the gunship, the flight deck, the pilot, the sarge, the combat drop, the walkers (Star Wars). Even the guy that can't walk now being able to walk is from \"Lost.\" <br/><br/>Trite, straightforward and pretty ham-handed drama of the military guy against the ethical soldier against the scientists against the natives...Universal Soldier (Van Damme), Soldier (Kurt Russell).<br/><br/>Avatar concept is old, and even more so now that that concept is recycled into the virtual reality gimmick: Sargon controlling Kirk, Kirk exchanging minds with that crazy lady that wanted to be Captain, Spock's Brain (where his body was controlled by a remote control), The Matrix.<br/><br/>Weaver's character was a waste - she did not play a big part in the story and the part that she did play was sketchy. Weaver had been there how many years? Teaching them English? And she's still there leading the team even though the military is there moving? And the natives still accept her? Weaver is all hostile to the new guy right up until she puts him in the mind link chamber. Then they meet up on the other side and she's all smiles and charm towards him. Huh? The climactic battle was a lot like the Ewoks against the Empire in \"Return of the Jedi,\" right down to the grenades in the engines.<br/><br/>The big revelation in the movie of the neural network of the trees fell totally flat. That was supposed to be a big dramatic moment but I think everyone in the audience, just like those on the command deck were like: \"So what? Is that supposed to mean something?\" There were only a few lines in the movie that supported that plot line and after the big revelation it was pretty much dropped.<br/><br/>Characters were not colorful and well differentiated like in Aliens (All the characters were colorless: The wheelchair guy, his buddy, Weaver, the traitorous pilot, the native mother and father had extremely small parts, the native prince was colorless, even the princess was pretty colorless, the pencil pusher heartless bureaucrat, the Colonel was the only character that was almost good), there was no sparkling dialog like all throughout Aliens.<br/><br/>It seems that some of the \"Wow factor\" of the movie was contained in the computer displays in the lab, especially the ones that could be swiped off the wall and onto a tablet PC. If they thought that would impress me....oh please. Spielberg already tried all that exact same stuff in \"Minority Report\" to equally unimpressive results and Cameron, of all people, should know that no matter how impressive your production is, it's useless without a great drama with all of the elements needed to make drama great.</div>,\n",

A protagonist, an antagonist, point A, rising action... all that jazz.. It's like Titanic, but in space... Trust me, it is THAT good, the only thing that separates this and titanic is the fact that titanic was BASED on fact.<br/><br/>Hang on a minute, didn't Cameron direct that too?<br/><br/>I like Cameron's choice of cast here, I think it is spot on, the lead is believable and the other cast are good to foot, especially the bad guy, he gave me a big johnny on.<br/><br/>The only thing I was left wondering was what colour the blue things pooed, everything else was colourful and wonderful, but I just wanted to see one of them poo.<br/><br/>Thumbs up to this film, it is one of the greats, and no matter how much I try and pick it apart, there is always something in it that makes me smile.<br/><br/>Go and see this, go and see this NOW.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The special effects, sound, and scenery was unbelievable! This is the future in animation and special effects! I will say this however: the story plot doesn't, I'm sorry to say, seem very original. This seemed like a holocaust-from-another-planet-like story line. So, I think the writers could have put a little bit more effort into that factor. But that is NO reason for skipping this movie! The acting was great! I have no idea why Zoe Saldana did not get at least an Academy Award nomination for her performance! She played an alien princess character flawlessly and Sam Wellington and Siqourney Weaver were awesome in their roles as well! Stephen Lang was very good also as a corrupting, almost-psychotic officer bent on destroying a race for irrational reasons. It should be in any person's DVD collection! James Cameron is truly one of the film industry's leading pioneers in animation and special effects! This movie is an 8/10, I am proud to say!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">When you stop caring, or even noticing, the CGI, you know you're watching a good movie.<br/><br/>I generally hate CGI, especially in large doses. It's disheartening for me to watch a big screen knowing that every little detail is there because someone thought to draw it. Nothing accidental, nothing by chance, or dropped in by human quirk. But Avatar made me not care. And that's really saying something.<br/><br/>I fell in love with the scenery! This movie was simply beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>The story was 100% predictable. You know what the protagonist is going to do, every step of the way, and sometimes you have to wait a while for it. But who cares? It was great. When it ended, I don't know where 2-1/2+ hours went! I honestly didn't want it to end. I didn't want to leave that world.<br/><br/>This is what the big screen is made for!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I am a huge fan of James Cameron. I love all of his movies that he's directed....even this one. This movie was truly amazing. Truly! But it did have some slow scenes and sometimes I felt it was 40-50 mins too long.<br/><br/>The story was well told...it was very different. Trying to keep it where it very real and not trying to make it so over the top where the audience just goes \"That is not the future at all.\" This could happen in hundreds of years from now. Very believable stuff.<br/><br/>The acting was fantastic. Even Michelle Rodriguize was fantastic! Every character served a purpose. No one ever felt pointless or left out. What I also liked about the movie is that even the action scenes (including fight scenes) were never overdone and it didn't try too hard to make it so action packed. Everything was just perfect...again...except the pacing.<br/><br/>Excluding the slow pacing....this movie was fantastic. Fantastic last fight scene too! This movie is pure imagination! I hope it at least wins one Oscar. It should be nominated for 12 Oscars lol.<br/><br/>8/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">When I saw all the names that went into making this movie I am reminded of those who helped bring Walt Disney's dream to life. Also how so much greatness can be achieved when people work together in this world than the total ruin that senseless hatred, murder, violence and wars bring bout. This movie shows us how easily mankind can be so careless in overlooking things that have real importance compared to what we think in our busy lives to be important. That in taking for granted things around us can bring bout our own undoing. Greed &amp; power is often blinded to sound reason or clear judgment. Avatar is a great masterpiece of which never enough can be said or expressed. James Cameron work is like having the touch of gold.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I saw this film at the cinema in 3D when it first came out and while it is more impressive on a technical level rather than as a piece of storytelling, Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking. Avatar is joyously entertaining and energetic and is also a smart combination of the Matrix and Star Wars, with a result that's stylish. Sam Worthington's character is compelling because you can easily care for and sympathize with him through his journey on Pandora. The movie has a surprising soul and is surprisingly sweet too. The pacing is great, the special effects are great, the score is hauntingly powerful and the filmmaking formula in Avatar is smoothly efficient and original. The film successfully manages to absorb you into its own universe. I thought that James Cameron's vision of the future matched the imagination he put into the attractive and totally believable design of the world of Pandora, the animal creatures and the Na'vi, making Pandora a place worth visiting. Talking about that I think that so far of all of the movies I've ever seen in my life I think that Avatar is the film that's the most technically original. Another interesting thing in this movie is the fact that the main character played by Sam Worthington is an ordinary character and is completely new to the moon of Pandora but through an unexpected twist of fate becomes a leader that transforms the world as he unexpectedly switches sides to the good and right side and that's something which made the movie feel bigger, better and more effective. If people asked me what should be the most admired thing in this film I would reply to them that it is its visual effects, design of the creatures, the world of Pandora and the Na'vi and its wonderful use of 3D which fortunately doesn't distract the audience from the central tale. Storytelling should have been the one though. My rating for Avatar: 7.9/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I waited several years after this movies release before watching it for the first time. Around year 2015. The hype was over by then and I'm glad I waited that long. The movie showed to be garbage. Everything about it feels like someone mentioned in their review, as a \"Pocahontas ripoff\". The emotional sides of the movie felt ridicolous, the CGI was horrible and yes, just garbage</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar has really good special effects and music but the characters and story is kind of like a puppet show of fern gully, the last rainforest or dances with wolves for science fiction. This is where James Cameron has gone haywire with his screenplay. I wanted this movie to be good but compared to titanic, the abyss, the terminator movies and true lies this is movie eye candy compared to movie magic.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie delivers good acting, outstanding visuals, great attention to detail. It is very immersive, especially in the 3D version.<br/><br/>That said - this is essentially Dances with Wolves in space. Not quite but close. Then throw in some elements from Aliens (i.e. corporate greed leading to bad things) and it pretty much sums up the plot line. Throw in the anti-deforestation of the rain forest eco-crowd and the picture is complete.<br/><br/>This does not take away from the movie. Its just not terribly original.<br/><br/>Down points (for me - as they are stereotypical portrayals from a Hollywood establishment that is very left of center): Military is evil, rain forest is raised to a God like level, corporations always sink to the lowest possible level.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I would just like to say that, first off, I'm aware that this is an excellent film. It's original, and it's overwhelmingly enjoyable. However, that is only for some people. For me, however, well... Let's just say that it didn't get me.<br/><br/>I went into this with some of the highest expectations that I've ever had. I wanted to be wowed, quite simply. And I wasn't. I felt that the film followed too much of a formula, and took too many turns into clichés. I've got a feeling the only reason nobody has noticed these things is due to the revolutionary visual effects the film presented. Never before seen. It blinded many people from what story was actually there. And there wasn't much story. It was quite simple.<br/><br/>The story followed closely behind the usual District 9-ish themes. It, like many before it, just states that the United States Government is corrupt and always wants control of everything for their own uses, etc. This storyline and its themes is so hackneyed, that seeing Cameron take advantage of it makes me sick. This film doesn't come close to his others, including Terminator, Aliens and Titanic. <br/><br/>However, I will say that the background to the characters and to the aliens was extremely fascinating and original. Cameron has a way of doing things like that. But that wasn't enough to save the film for me. I didn't even enjoy for the action and adventure, because quite frankly it wasn't that impressive. I didn't feel that anything was real and the CGI was used to an extent that the film just turned into an animation.<br/><br/>Overall, the film fails mostly on an emotional level. I didn't feel a thing for any of the characters. I didn't care who lived, or who died. Sam Worthington tried hard, and he gave a great performance, but it wasn't great enough to save everything else. Best film of the last 30 years? No. Way. In. Hell. I don't even think it was one of the best films of the decade, let alone the best film of the year.<br/><br/>All I've got to say, is that this film definitely did not surpass the hype. It didn't get me.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Years ago when Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was released (2001), it set a benchmark for rendered animated actors in a movie. I remember reading about the hundreds of hours of rendering time it took to make and was in awe of the animation. Man have we come a long way! Thanks to Moore's law, computing power has nearly tripled since then and the complexity of animation that's capable now blurs the line between CG and live-action &amp; effects. Cameron has reportedly spent MILLIONS of $ on this movie and it shows in every aspect of the movie. Cameron is a master at telling a story and what I HATE in a lot of movies using live action and animated/CG characters is certainly absent from this movie. I SO hate it when some CG monster pops out at the actors and it HAS to roar (or do some OTHER formulaic action that's been miserably repeated ad nauseum in other movies) and stands there for a few seconds looking menacing and THEN it attacks our main character(s). I think Cameron must have did some homework and observations in nature to see how animals and such respond to threats and aggress in the wild. That part I feel he got pretty bang on and you CAN feel hair rise up on your skin and some semblance of what the character would probably be feeling. One example is when Jake accompanies the two scientist as a guard and is chased by some kind of creature. You can literally feel the panic, the branches banging on the characters face, and the wind as the creature takes swipes at him. I also like that the character's CG looked about 95% lifelike and not hyper-rendered or ultra-fluid. We CAN see the state-of-the-art in Avatar. The CG animation is ALMOST 100% like-like. Better than anything we've seen to date. When you encounter an animated actor in other movies, you can tell right away they are animated as they just don't have that certain human gait to their mannerisms and expressions. Cameron has pulled an ace out of the hat with the CG in that respect. I would guess a LOT of characters in the movie had some kind of motion-capture applied to them as they appeared vastly more realistic to what we recognize as motion and expression in the natural world. OK, on to the story and other elements.<br/><br/>I can see some of the elements of what people say with regard to Last Samurai and Dances With Wolves BUT this is not THAT kind of movie. If you don't want to know TOO much of the movie, skip this part NOW! We learn that humans have pretty much plundered and rendered their own world sans \"green\" and have traveled 6 years (light years?) to a planet called Pandora because it has this stuff called Unobtainium (probably because it's unobtainable on earth, could have had a better name but I \"get\" why it's called that, slight allusion there) that goes for 20 million an ounce (or some such measure of weight) and the aliens are sitting on a mother-load of it. The human have been trying to court the aliens to swindle them...I mean, relocate them so they can dig up the Unobtanium. That's as much as you'll need to know in terms of premise of the movie. So with that, you can see the allusion to the \"white man\" coming in and taking away the Native American's land for a few baubles and beans. I think it was Cameron's intent to liken the aliens to Native Americans as it gives the story a bit of accessibility and digs into our collective past and how we treated the Native American's when \"we\" arrived. What it boils down to is Cameron saying to his audience that we as humans need to do a much better job of taking care of what we HAVE rather than progressing towards being a people who take from others and will ignorantly kill anything and anyone just to get what we THINK is ours.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't agree with others saying this is the Star Wars of this generation. I thought the story was worthy of Cameron's name and his production and direction of this movie will not be rivaled ANY time soon. You will not notice the 2 1/2 hours length of the movie. Yes, it is THAT good. I look forward to watching it on BluRay or in 3D to see what I am really missing. If you walk away from this movie thinking \"stupid CGI, pro-alien, and anti-human\", you missed the whole point of the movie. BUT, if you walk away thinking that even if we ever live long enough or advance far enough to explore other worlds, we should always remember that if there is life already on another planet, it was there, long, long, LONG ago before we showed up.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This film will give you an experience remembered, as it is surely one of the most cinematically enveloping, visually, to come about in a long time. I must confess my awe of this movie, as I don't believe I moved a notch, the duration through.<br/><br/>When it was all said and done, however, even in that haze, I recall feeling as if it were all a bit contrived, sentimental, and by the numbers. You can balk at that, but do not let the robust visuals and \"experience\" factor take you away from my point. You boil away the visuals and you have a markedly less interesting story.<br/><br/>Having said all that, this film was obviously well worth it, on the basis that it will bring minions of children and young adults joy, the world over. It is an impacting film that lingers, visually, in the memory. At my age, however, I can easily see through it...so, I guess that's the trade off every time you make a cross-marketed film.<br/><br/>I didn't really enjoy this film, save for the high I felt after I left the theater.<br/><br/>IMO</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Sorry...I did not think Avatar was MINDBLOWING. Yes, it is creative and visually entertaining...but the hype that was stirred up about it seems a little over the top in my opinion. It was overly promoted to sell tickets..and make movie goers think it was a MUST SEE film. The storyline seemed good...but the CGI effects were nothing special..they are almost a required part of every action movie being made today anyway. When this film was first advertised...I thought...WOW..it is going to be a milestone in filmaking history...but...no...it was just another movie overly promoted by the media to make money. I wonder how many people went to see this because of the hype...and because seeing it labeled you as \"cool\"or on the \"cutting edge\" when it came to film viewing? Following the crowd just to see a film like everyone else is boring. Seeing a film because YOU think it will be entertaining is the way it should be.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Frankly I don't care what anybody says about Avatar. Whether they say it's overrated or it didn't deserve to be the highest grossing movie of all time or or it's unoriginal or it's too long or boring or it they say \"this is better than Avatar\" it's still up there with some of my favourite movies of all time. I mean people were the same when Titanic was released; a lot of people called it overrated but that didn't stop it from winning 11 Oscars and being called a masterpiece by many others. James Cameron has made a lot of great movies in his career like the first two Terminator movies, Aliens, True Lies, Titanic and Avatar is up there with them. <br/><br/>I was blown away by it when I saw it in the cinema. It was like I was actually on the planet Pandora myself. I know the movie takes stories from other movies like Disney's Pocahontas and The Last Samurai. But I mean look at The Lion King for instance, it used the same story from other stories like Hamlet and Moses and it's considered one of the greatest animated movies ever made. And sometimes originality isn't always a good thing; I mean look a Twilight. Do you think it's a good idea to have vampires sparkling? <br/><br/>But anyway let me tell you why I really enjoy Avatar, I enjoy pretty much everything about Avatar: the action, the effects, the characters and even the story. I mean I like how Jake Sully as a nobody but as the movie progresses, he becomes a hero among Na'vi and brings them all together to face off the humans who are destroying their planet. In fact, you might say that Avatar is more about special effects, but it just shows that anybody can become a hero no matter who they are. I also enjoy Zoe Saldana as Neytiri and Avatar (as well as 2009's Star Trek) made her a superstar and the romance between her and Jake Sully. And the battle scenes are just as epic as battles scenes in movies like The Lord of the Rings or Braveheart. And I like like the dramatic moments as well. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, let me just say Avatar is #14 on my top 30 favourite movies list and I recommend everyone to see it and I look forward to the sequels in the near future.</div>,\n",

For once the hype was actually deserved. I won't talk about the plot, this film is best seen with as little information as possible. I will say that I wasn't prepared for the experience, even as a jaded film-goer I was transported and yes, moved. I didn't expect the emotional impact, but Cameron is a master at pushing all the right buttons, and he does so here masterfully.<br/><br/>Some of the criticism lies in the \"surface\" quality of the plot, but again, Cameron has never made deep, cerebral films. Cameron is an entertainer, and thank God for it. This film is pure, futuristic, ahead of it's time escapism. I was absolutely floored.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Remember when you went to the movies to be entertain and not to judge? Yeah me neither, so enter Avatar, pure fun, pure visual adrenaline mixed with a basic but effective story. Lets face it, we're pretty done with original stories we're left with original ways to tell it, again enter Avatar.<br/><br/>Now Avatar has of course changed the way movies CAN be made and can be SEEN, which is praise enough in itself but there is more to it than visual. I happened to enjoy the stories, the simple effective story and dialogue, i think an overly complex approach to an already complex visual would A) be boring and B) defeat the purpose of a movie going experience.<br/><br/>Jake Sully's twin scientist brother is killed a week before shipping out to a distant world called Pandora, where he would control an Avatar (an avatar of the natives of Pandora, the Na'vi) and Jake is called to fill in his place. With the incentive to get some money and face a new challenge Jake accepts. Of course Jake clashes personality wise with science in general and bonds well with the military, but soon accepts \"science\" after he really gets the hang of his Avatar body. during an outing in his Avatar Jake meets Neyteri (an oddly attractive Navi) and here enters the love story and of course Jake's reason for not wanting to deceive them all. So there we have our love interests and personal conflicts which of course will create outer conflicts, all of which pay off nicely in this movie.<br/><br/>I digress i know so i'll just skip to it. Avatar = a movie who's story enables you to be transported into a NEW world and enjoy the ride while it lasts. A first step in the right direction.<br/><br/>Let Avatar 2 give us complex story in a world we'll then be familiar with.<br/><br/>7 out of 10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">With over 2000 posts already, what else can one say about this extraordinary movie? Sure, it's derivative. Yes, it is episodic. It is certainly very spectacular. But that is the nature of 3D: it's nothing if not spectacular. Even stereo slide shows are pretty, but prettiness is never enough. The sound, the music? More Wagner than Morricone, but how many original tunes are there anyway? The Morricone sound is there, and even the visuals from 'The Mission' are there. Look at that climb up the waterfall. What point was it, except, say, 'Why don't we have a waterfall?' Then there's the too-lengthy horse-breaking sequence. Every second Western has to have one. You want acting? Thankfully, none of the cast is required to act, even though there is a hint or two that one or two of them have some histrionic ability. Drama? The essence of drama is conflict, with a change in the characters as part of the resolution. The character, Grace, does change, but altogether too early in the show to be really part of the drama. I did stay until the end of the credits; were there really 3000 on the payroll? I suspect that the walkouts were more a matter of bladder control than boredom. Or was it the headache from the 3D glasses? This retired cinematographer has great admiration for the technical staff. They are very clever indeed. But it is possible to be clever and unintelligent, and in this movie they go close to that.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">As i sat in the theatre i was not as excited as i wished i could have been. 3 Hours Later and the credits rolled i walked out with nothing but pride knowing that James Cameron who has been on hiatus for 12 years making crappy documentaries still has the magic to make great entertaining films.<br/><br/>Avatar is about Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) who is called to Pendorra to take his twin brother's place in a program where he turns into a creature called a Na'vi which are savage creatures which live on the planet.As Jake bonds with the creatures in his new form,he soon realises what the human's intentions are and decides to help this race in defending their planet.<br/><br/>To start off.This film is spectacular viewing.The effects are wonderful and do not really need 3-D to make the viewing amazing although i hear 3-D is wonderful.I thought the creatures were wonderful creations which makes you wonder how did James Cameron make these fascinating creatures.Acting is also brilliant.Sam Worthington does a great performance as both a human and a Na'vi.Sigorney Weaver is also very good as the scientist.<br/><br/>There are not really any bad things that i notices but apparently the plot is similar to Dances with Wolves.Well i don't think there were major or eye spotting problems.I thought the story was wonderful and there were no slip ups.<br/><br/>So Avatar is maybe Cameron's finest work in my opinion.If a sequel is made then i will welcome it with open arms.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">So, we went and saw Avatar last night at the 3D IMAX.<br/><br/>It is a beautiful movie. It absolutely sells the mix of 3D animation and live action on a level I haven't seen before. The art direction is simply stunning and highly imaginative. The 3D is used not to poke you in the eye but to immerse you in the space. It was well worth the few extra bucks we paid to see it in large format 3D. It is, in a word, breathtaking.<br/><br/>The story is well written and executed but is mostly a mix of semi- standard science fiction plot vehicles. I wont go into spoilers here beyond the title of this review, but suffice it to say there are no ideas here that will excite or surprise anyone with a decent knowledge of classic speculative fiction.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call it a great movie, in the way, say, The Godfather is a great movie. This is, in the end, B movie fare. But, of course, thats what Cameron has always been good at. <br/><br/>It does have stupendous A-plus production values and is worth watching for the visual spectacle alone. That the story is decent and competently told, is an added bonus. That it is hardly original and thus somewhat predictable, well, you forgive it that for all the eye-candy it gives you</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The rendering, of the arrival, base and mining operation is stupendous. Well conceived and executed. However, we are already in a world of cliché. The whole kaboodle is not a stones-throw from Starship Troopers thought bigger and better. And the entire Viet-Nam analogy is utterly so obvious that only the pace gets one beyond it.<br/><br/>After the clichés of briefing by a card-board stereotype of a movie colonel we are introduced to the technological conceit at the heart of the plot. There's a basic problem of logic with it. How is it that if some kind of spinning hardware like an MRI scanner is necessary at the \"driver\" end of each exchange of consciousness no such thing is required at the \"Avatar\" end? I mean, to send a radio message, or any other kind of exchange requiring a piece of hardware at the \"sending\" end its usually necessary to have a receiver at the other end? <br/><br/>Well there's really no answer to that, we just have to overlook it.To anyone watching this for the first time I recommend you just skip the middle hour and a half entirely. <br/><br/>Its worth seeing the end of the movie just to witness the shameless lie-merchandising mode into which Cameron et-als puerile mind-set defaults when their mask finally slips. As I say, nobody should be surprised, but what is surprising is that these \"sky-people\" from Planet Hollywood think they can colonise our minds with their air-headed ignorance. First up the Eco-lie stated quite clearly by the guy who describes Earth as a dead planet on which there is no foliage. Well, however far in the future its set, on present trends that's just simply a lie. Earth is experiencing, partly due to rising CO2 levels, an extraordinary greening. Desertification which had been threatening much of the world for decades is now very palpably reversing. The eco preach is not simply a cliché, it's a cliché stated in contradiction of simple facts. it's a lie.<br/><br/>The second lie is the stereotyped Imperialist Horror!. Yes there was and in some places still is an Imperialist Horror. Apocalypse Now (\"The Horror\") was based on Heart of Darkness and that story was based on fact. BUT, and that's a big but, whilst Imperialists have desecrated the sites and communities of cultures they have oppressed, for example the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamelan, or burning down of churches that has become an epidemic in much of the Conflicted World, the scale of destruction envisaged here is quit literally exorbitant. You do have to watch it, I'm afraid, to grasp that the Humans in this movie wreak a destruction on the indigenous people that is, one hundred or on thousand times as grievous as anything that ever happened in Western Imperialist history. To find anything similar we would need to look at the actions of the Inca Empire or, indeed, the Third Reich. What Belgium did in the Congo chills the heart, but it pales into insignificance compared to the destruction of the arboreal heart of the Navi. This isn't about numbers killed (millions on Earth compared to hundreds in the movie) but the profundity of the assault. Again, unfortunately, you have to sit through this movie to appreciate the way the analogy with Western Imperialism has been blown out of any Earthly comparison. <br/><br/>Finally we come to why I think the movie is ultimately disgusting. It comes when the renegade pilot says that she had hoped that there would b a tactical plan that did not involve \"martyrdom\".<br/><br/>Now who talks of \"martyrdom\" as a tactic? And how many times have \"martyrdom missions\" been conducted? Where and against whom? In the decade after 2001 there were in excess of 20,000 such \"martyrdom\" missions and the overwhelming body of victims were civilians, non-combatant men, women, children, across the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia, South-West Asia, China, Eastern Europe and yes, western Europe and the USA. However, the overwhelming abundance of targets were not even arguably Western Imperialists as Cameron et al undoubtedly want us to think, they were not even \"Westerners\", but people of many cultures who happened to be of the wrong tribe, sect, religion, in conflicts that for the most part date back long before the USA even existed. This movie, by cueing us with the word \"martyrdom\" in that specific context, attempts to justify such acts, romanticising them as the self-sacrificing actions of underdogs against oppressors. Sometimes they have been. Overwhelmingly they are not. Cameron must really have good yoga skills to insert his head where it must be for him not to have noticed this.<br/><br/>We must not forget the sheer arrogance of Cameron et al in ripping off without credit the source artists for this \"vision\", particularly the Russian Noon Universe novels of the Strugatsky brothers (about the Nave people of arboreal planet Pandora\n",
       " kind of similar eh) and Ursula Leguins \"The Word for World is Forest\". Most blatantly of all, the floating mountains from the work of Roger Dean\n",
       " a favourite of my teen years\n",
       " although here they tend ultimately to remind one more of the Flash Gordon movie. The scene with thousands of Navi riding winged creatures to battle almost absurdly reminiscent of Brian Blessed and his winged sky-warriors in that earlier (vastly superior) movie.<br/><br/>Cameron et al attempt to beguile us, weave a web of fairy-tale fancies and pass off upon us two howling lies and an ethical equivocation that is utterly disgusting. The bottom line is the irony that the shallow, morally simplistic dufus character at the heart of the movie pretty neatly sums up the kind of air-heads these Hollyood sky People themselves are. No doubt this commentary will antagonise many who read it: people who cannot process long sentences with multiple sub-clauses and people with the same superficial mind-set as Cameron and his mates.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's newest creation was a thrilling ride, but lacked in story with a few cliché scenes. There were few times I looked down at my watch in boredom.<br/><br/>Jake Sully, an ex-marine willingly takes over his deceased brother's Avatar to feel what it is like to walk once again (in his avatar's body). Bound to a wheelchair, Jake is soon given the opportunity to get the money for surgery if he spied on the Na'vi, a species on the moon Pandora. The Na'vi were nested around a spiritual tree which harvested valuable minerals which the humans wanted. <br/><br/>Of course Jake falls in love with a Na'vi, and the movie gets predictable from that point on. There were also aspects of the film... like the physical connection/network which bonds all creatures on Pandora felt very overdone.<br/><br/>The real amazing part of this film was the computer generated images, and of course the incredible 3D. The experience was just like looking out a window. The colours, plus this new world Cameron built was phenomenal. I feel proud to have this director come from my home city.<br/><br/>This movie was not as good as the Terminator films or Alien, but it definitely was worth my money and I probably will see it again.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Yes, the special effects are amazing, and for that I give it a 10. But the story line is one we have seen before. Instead of Kevin Costner, we have Sam Worthington joining the tribe and falling in love with the chief's daughter. Then he helps them fight off the invasion of the \"cowboys\" (in this case the Marines). I was bored halfway through and knew how it was going to turn out.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It looks pretty, just suffers from poor pacing, style over substance, average acting, lack of emotive characters. Looks pretty though.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Like almost everyone else alive, I was looking forward to Avatar but I wasn't going on opening day or even opening week. I waited and lucky me, when I went to see it in IMAX 3D at 10am on a Saturday morning, there weren't even 30 people in the auditorium. Clean, comfy, and quiet. Just the way I like to see my movies that I pay for. Online ticketing was trying to charge me 15 bucks plus service fee. I paid at the box office because I knew it wasn't gonna sell out like it did the night before when I really wanted to go. 9 bucks was the tally. Can't beat that.<br/><br/>Say what you wanna say and feel how you wanna feel about me for saying what I'm about to say, but I thought the movie totally sucked! That's right, I said it. This movie might as well have been a children's book it was so fluffy. Minimal cussing (even with the military present in this flick), no non-human nudity, straightforward plot with no twists or turns, ultra predictable, monotone and unmemorable characters, borderline unrealistic war motives, pointless deaths, uncreative and fairy tale climax, and the environmental theme was thrown in your face so much that you'd think you were watching a PBS special. Special effects aside (they were top-notch), there was nothing I liked about this movie. I very rarely laughed. I don't think I did at all. Only thing that got a chuckle from a few peeps was when the antagonist said he was part of the Jarhead Clan. That's about it. It was a practically emotionless movie-going experience.<br/><br/>I mean, come on. You turn on your own species over a girl? She gives you a piece and that's all it takes? I can see about him wanting to become one of them because of the girl and having a functional body but is he really ready to live the natural life and abandon TV, internet, and all the other wonders of human technology? Yes, the tech is a demon and it can also be a godsend. I get it. But that morality was never discussed or explored. No civilized human alive would just switch that quick. I ain't buying it. Regardless of the cost for him to get new legs, I ain't buying it. Things could have been done differently. The world they created and the creatures within it were a little too forced for my taste. Took up too much screen time that could have been devoted to adding more complexity to an otherwise oversimplified plot. The whole deal was just too textbook. No depth at all.<br/><br/>3D effects weren't so good. All the previews before the movie were of 3D movies, all of them kid movies. I expect more from 3D. I've gotten more from 3D. Those previews and the movie didn't deliver the goods. Depth perception is altered but nothing moves beyond the four corners of the screen or comes out at you. The IMAX screen was big with a crisp, clear picture and sound. I'll give credit where it's due. But save your money and if you have to see this movie, just watch it on a regular screen for a regular price. I would tell you to just wait for it on Blu-ray and if you have a nice sized TV, just watch it that way. To me, it's not worth a penny. It's boring and not at all entertaining. The only surprises were seeing Sigourney Weaver and Giovanni Ribisi. Wasn't expecting to see those two. If this movie was Rated R and more authentic, then maybe it'd be worth a whirl. But as it is, if you have the mentality of a simple-minded and impressionable 10 year old, this movie is tailor-made for you. I give it 4 out of 10 stars. I don't care how popular it is or how much money it's made and is gonna make. For me, it sucks chicken bones. A complete and total waste of time and money. I'm disappointed more than anything. I expect better from James Cameron.<br/><br/>Even with all that said, this movie still got a round of applause when it finished. Now it joins the ranks of Equilibrium, the Godzilla teaser trailer, Spirited Away, and the first live-action Transformers movie as the only movies I've been in attendance of that have gotten some applause. Nothing happens after the credits so don't waste your time even further like I did. And when I left the auditorium, there was a long line of people waiting to get in for the next showing. Wanted to tell them so bad that the movie is a dud but everyone has their own tastes. I would have been upset even more if I had to wait in a line like that to see such a horrible movie. It only got those 4 stars from me because of the innovative special effects and Zoe Saldana's voice acting. Everything else? FAIL!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I'm not really that old, but I've seen quite a few movies in my day. After Lord of the Rings was completed, I wondered if I'd ever be truly excited by a motion picture again. Well, James Cameron has done it with Avatar. There are the obvious cinematic innovations to acknowledge: carefully used 3D, the new motion capture technology, etc. The film just simply LOOKS great. I found myself giggling with joy at the pure beauty of so many of the scenes of Pandora (the alien planet) and its fauna. Cameron's time deep sea diving has obviously fired his imagination for strange and wonderful creatures. There is solid acting (particularly Stephen Lang, as the Colonel, who somehow pulls off a gritty depiction of a now very clichéd role), and there wasn't a single line in the script that had me checking my brain at the door. (There are some recycled lines, to be sure, but I didn't find them distracting.) Score by Horner was subtle, yet still moving. Frankly, though, what worked more than anything for me was the overall storytelling. A number of my friends were disappointed with the \"gone native\" tale, that has been \"done to death\" through previous works like \"Dances With Wolves\" or \"Last Samurai\", but I didn't find it old at all. Rather, this is a fantastic re-imagining of the age old human tendency to colonize and obliterate other cultures and environments. Cameron is definitely spinning us a morality yarn, but it is one that cannot be spun enough times, and he does make every effort to make this iteration the most beautiful you will ever see. 10/10 p.s. Without any intentional hyperbole, I consider this to be the finest movie I've ever seen.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Gawd, I really wanted to like this movie. After hearing so much about it for weeks on end, I was waiting so that I could catch it in its best version, namely in IMAX 3-D. Well, finally I did get a chance over the new years weekend with my friends in Mumbai. If this is what the best version had to offer, I can imagine how much I may have disliked it in normal 2-D.<br/><br/>First of all, I do like good big budget actioners, which also have fresh characters and credibility of plot. The Dark Knight or the recent Star Trek are recent movies which I really liked. However, I have never been able to enjoy or like a movie which just has exorbitant special effects and no screenplay, dialog or character development. This is probably why I actually managed to sleep through some time of the mayhem that was the second half of the first Transformers movie, and didn't bother to watch the second one. However, I did expect James Cameron to not just make a showpiece of a movie. One of my all time favorites, T2 was done by him. You never felt in that movie that he was compromising on script, characters, dialogs or intensity for effects. I even liked Titanic quite a bit. But this one was plain disappointing. Credit has to be given where due. The idea and beauty of Pandora, and the basic premise was amazingly interesting. But the screenplay left a lot to be desired. Some of the lines uttered by Sully's and Neytiri's Na'vi characters are so cheesy and clichéd that you feel even the most run of the mill romantic comedies do it better. On top of that, the various scenes look like they had been picked up from a collection of good movies over the years (like the brilliant LOTR trilogy). And what in the world was all that sudden spirituality thrown in at the end? It just did not fit in credibly with the story till then.<br/><br/>But I guess these days, most of these movies do well. Which would explain why Transformers 2 and Avatar are among the biggest hits of the year, and Avatar will probably challenge Titanic for all time Box Office earnings. And why something beautiful and complex like Watchmen was probably not watched by half as many people as who saw Avatar. Sad though. I never thought I'll be disappointed with Cameron.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I was originally a little harsh in my first review of \"Avatar,\" believing that the film was too reliant on its visuals and CGI to make up for its one-dimensional story. However, after having watched it a second time, I noticed that the flaws didn't seem as big as when I first watched it, while the film's pluses shone even more.<br/><br/>As many reviewers have previously mentioned, the quality of the visuals are not up for debate. Pandora is wonderfully realized; you can see that James Cameron was obviously inspired by the Amazon rainforest for his fantastical, near-dreamlike visions. The floating mountains, as well as the floating waterfall, seem to be like Angel Falls broken up and thrown into the sky (I don't think it's coincidence that Cameron had Jake Sully serve in Venezuela once). And as for the Na'vi, there were a few moments when they seemed photo-real. Cameron has had a long history of getting the CGI to look as close to realistic as possible, and just like in \"T2\" and \"Titanic,\" his attention to the graphics pays off.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed was that the acting was mostly solid by everyone, and that there seemed to be no weak performances (something I could not say about \"Titanic\"). While there are no standouts, both lead and supporting actors and actresses seem very in tune with their characters and with each other. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana carry the film well, and their romance even felt a little touching. Sigourney Weaver isn't as strong here as she is in some of her earlier roles, but she's fine nonetheless. Stephen Lang also gets to chew the scenery up as one of the meanest soldiers this side of Colonel Kilgore.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it's pretty similar to \"Dances With Wolves.\" Only Jake Sully and (more or less) Neytiri feel developed into three-dimensional characters, while the rest of the cast either lack dimensions or only serve for important plot points. There are also a couple of hokey, heavy handed moments during important parts (kind of to be expected from Cameron's pictures). Perhaps another rewrite would have fleshed out more characters and cleaned up some of the dialogue.<br/><br/>Still, it works. Because Jake Sully was well developed, I felt engaged in his quest to get to know the Na'vi better and, eventually, defend them. I was always impressed by \"Avatar's\" visuals and CGI. While I wouldn't call \"Avatar\" one of the best film's of 2009, I will say it is definitely one of the most entertaining, and represents another solid hit for Cameron's attention to great visuals and superb CGI.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is preachy anti western propaganda. I think everyone understood that from the onset. Yet, it does contain enough new ideas, artfully presented, to keep it interesting throughout.<br/><br/>It is a visual landmark. From this day forward we can expect the vivid realization of worlds we have never dreamed of. There may still be a handful of technical kinks to work out, but basically filmmakers can show us anything they want us to see as if we are standing right in the midst of it.<br/><br/>Now to the preachy part. It is sad that the sages of Hollywood can realize a completely structural justification for what amounts to animism but can not imagine the possibility of a similar, albeit less easily understood, justification for some of the monotheistic religions. Gaia is possible, but God is not? Couldn't there be some similar all encompassing structure that ties together and embraces everything in the universe? Maybe we are seeing in the strings of superstring theory something akin to the tentacles of Avatar's great neural network.<br/><br/>Cameron seems to say in this film that creatures at the level of making bows and arrows and covering themselves with woven fabric can still be within the parameters of ecological balance but that creatures capable of building machines of steel that fly and walk can not. I would like to think that when humans arrive at the level of being able to travel to other planets and inject their consciousness into a biological counterpart they might also acquire some degree of subtlety. Couldn't they mine the desired elements with something small and unobtrusive so as not to disturb the local inhabitants and their ecosystem? What about the possibility of nanobots or at least very small mechanical moles? Are we to believe that a Hollywood filmmaker can grasp the significance of a planetary neural network but that the inheritors of our own technological achievements could not? <br/><br/>I suppose the thing that bothers me about this film is not the implied guilt of western civilization, but the arrogance of holier than thou film makers who presume they have some global awareness of universal truths unattainable to simpletons who merely advance and perfect technology. After all, isn't this film the culmination of vast amounts of human technology? Isn't it made possible by the gigantic system of theaters and persons willing to pay money to see this creation? How could anyone make a quarter of a billion dollar movie if it was not funded through the system of theaters where is it seen and by the people who pay to see it? The bad, ignorant, capitalistic grunts who stand accused in this film are the same ones who are supporting Cameron's habit.<br/><br/>Everyone should—rather must—see this film. It represents a transitional event in the art of visual representation. I just wish Hollywood would get off its high horse and look its fellow earthlings in the eye. Really, the universe is big enough for all of us!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Straight to the point: The movie pretends to have a story. I don't know what Cameron has been smoking while writing this screenplay, but it's easily his worst-written movie yet.<br/><br/>There's not one inch of character development. All characters are as clichéd as they get. Look no further than to Michelle Rodriguez, whose character is as blank as a piece of paper for the duration of the movie, before she suddenly declares right before the big battle: \"I didn't sign up for this s**t.\" Now, that's good writing.<br/><br/>Why did Cameron feel the need to rip off Aliens over and over? The design of the ships reeks of Aliens. The movements of the Navi somehow look like the movements of the titular Aliens. Rodriguez plays a B-movie version of the tough pilot from Aliens. The bad guy Paul Reiser played in Aliens was split up between Ribisi and Lang. The end fight between Lang and Saldana/Worthington/CGI creature is a reversal of the Aliens end fight between Weaver and the Alien queen.<br/><br/>Why was it necessary to create a Navi language? The most important Navi speak English really well. At one point Tsutey has suddenly become so advanced in the English language that he is able to give a simultaneous interpretation of Sully's big speech without any effort.<br/><br/>Why is Avatar a blatant copy of \"Dances with Wolves\"? Why is Avatar's mysticism even more embarrassing than the mysticism in the Matrix sequels? Why does Cameron use the big, old sledgehammer for his embarrassingly naive sociological-political-ecological message? This movie has too much fat that a more capable writer would've cut out radically. Cameron isn't a capable writer.<br/><br/>Forget about this piece of junk.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Still, there were some part you wondered why he put them in. The basketball scene and stuff like that. The story seemed familiar but the method is all Cameron's. I know there were many plot mistakes and technical blunders but only he real trained eye could catch them. Instead you excuse them and take part in the journey. I would watch it again. I love the ore angle and the fuel possibilities. The only thing I always have a problem with Cameron is the way her shapes his characters to be all good or all bad. Still, this is a great cinematic treat I haven't had in a long time. The CGI was astounding and I love the fact that he made the world CGI so the characters could seamlessly interact. My brother thought the lead was really crippled until I explained to him how it was done. Cameron knows something many to her movie makers need to learn. We want to escape for a minute and not think about reality. Yet he injects modern day problems into this and it works.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Im just sad that i didn't watch this masterpiece on big screen in 2009.. I'v watched this movie like 4-5 times and i can't wait for more sequels. Watched it again today, and decided to give a review. This movie has everything. Good story, character development and oh boy... CGI, the visuals are just amazing. Keep in mind this movie was released in 2009. I still think that this movie was ahead of its time\n",
       " U just can't give it less than 10 even if u don't like it, it deserves a 10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie was quite hyped up because of the 3D and wonderful CGI. It really does live up to those expectations. However that could not really safe the movie's poor plot. It's hard to be original with so many stories floating around. Every story/movie takes idea from some other story. However Avatar does it pretty blatantly almost making it look like Pocahontas or Dances with Wolves but with an alien theme. I also thought the movie dragged on way too long and found myself pretty bored after 2 hours so I had to watch it in 2 days. Action and CGI fans will probably love it. If you like a good story or fantasy I suggest to stay away from this. The problem also lies within the title. It could make people believe it was based on the animated series with the same name but it's something totally different. I think I'm generous giving it a 3.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron returns to big screen with all of his grandeur after 12 years of hypersleep. During all this time he mostly kept himself busy with some documentary projects like \"Expedition Bismark\" and last few years with Avatar. Apearently he was waiting for necessary CGI visual and camera technology to develop....<br/><br/>Usually I dislike when a movie production is sold to gullible audience through only with overblown massive CGI ( mainly with explosions ) and a lame bad or awful script and terrible or non existent characterization. Industrial Hollywood directors like Bay or Emmerich just sign on horrible scrips only to show latest massive CGI destruction scenes....But thankfully James Cameron does not take that path. He uses CGI and other extensive visual/camera technology to tell a simple , understandable ( though covered before in other previous productions ) story through visuals...That means he uses elegant scene capturing , camera work , excellent acting and elegant plus revolutionary CGI all combined together to tell a story , including its background and universe. He is using visuals , CGI to tell his story and set its background extensively. That's why \"Avatar\"s battle scene was towards its end ( it was also excellent and massive of course ) Cameron uses more than half of 162 minutes just to introduce this new alien planet , its ecology , biosphere and beautifully created Na'vi people plus characters with visuals..He takes his time...But to make it interesting he does that again with excellent amazing and creative visuals and scenery...And in 3-D wow..absolutely amazing...You are virtually in this alien but somehow familiar planet. And with all of these imagery , scenery , visual 3-D tech planet Pandora , its surroundings , plant-animal life and Na'vi culture all seem something novel , aesthetically gorgeous , wondrous and interesting to audience...That my friends is the mark of great movie making...We became so familiar and combined with Na'vi and their harmony with nature , way of life and beautiful environment when action starts we subconsciously side with them. It is almost like instinct...One side there is military industrial complex of humanity in future who wants to expel Na'vi with massive firepower , exploit their lands and ruin natural habitat ( as we have seen countless times in history in colonization of American and African continents ) just to mine a mineral below ground...At the other side these beautiful and simple people with their harmony with nature....<br/><br/>As I mentioned before story was covered before in other productions like Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas so it is also kinda predictable ( that's why I broke one star from rating ) but as I said before magic of Cameron is ability to tell even a simple and previously told story from a different angle with astonishing visuals , serious attitude ( there is no lame humor here ) and emotionally moving and exciting way...There isn't much originality left in Hollywood storytelling anyway..and I pick Avatar's story over stereotype evil aliens vs good victim humans and military saves world with massive firepower plots....Still towards the end of battle sequence some events began to go over the top....Like Eywa \"Mother Nature\" comes to rescue at last minute , it was a lame cop out McGuffin so good guys win at the end...Col. Quaritch jumping from crashing command craft in a battle suit was silly like something out of a dorky Bay movie and his final fight in battle suit with Jake and Neytiri reminded me a final boss level fight from a mediocre video game...<br/><br/>But these are small nit pickings. Basically story was good and it was about something ( anti-corporate , anti-militarization , nature/environment preservation ) As for the acting it was usually decent. Sam Worthington was OK...Zoe Saldana was excellent ( still amazed how her and other characters CGI facial features were so elegantly displayed in different emotions..How the hell they pulled off that ! ) Sigourney Weaver is bringing her usual professional performance. Her character Dr. Grace Augistine reminded me another character played by Weaver again..Dr Dian Fossey in \"Gorillas in the Mist\" (1988). Stephen Lang was great as bad ass Col. Quaritch. Lang had also pulled an impressive secondary character performance in Michael Mann's \"Public Enemies\" this summer and here in \"Avatar\" he does not disappoint again as main antagonist. Quaritch was basically General Patton of future...Giovanni Ribisi as Selfridge , a corporate weasel ( a clear rip off from Burke character from Aliens ) , Michelle Rodriguez as chopper pilot Trudy and Joel Moore as Spellman were again OK as secondary characters...<br/><br/>So summary : Master James Cameron is back folks...Though Avatar is short of excellent or perfect as it intends to be...it is damn good , it has at least a nice plot , amazing visual scenes and it provides a fantastic entertainment...And I loved the soundtrack..Definitely will buy it...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I saw this movie 5 times in the theater, and when it comes around in IMAX next time, I will be there.<br/><br/>CGI has once again provided us with a fantastic vision of the future. If the next two films turn out as great as this one, James Cameron will not have to worry about working again.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana give outstanding voice characterizations to their CGI characters. I also love how they created a whole new world including the fauna and animals.<br/><br/>This movie should be watched only on a wide screen TV so that you can enjoy the benefit of all of the action. I love to turn off all of the lights but a few candles and sit back and watch the full version of this movie with friends and family (my dogs because my wife doesn't enjoy SciFi).</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I saw (Avatar) with my daughter a few years ago (who was 16 at the time) and was so underwhelmed I think I fell asleep. But I concluded it was a politically correct kiddy flick for high school girls with not a lot of science learning or life experience. No problem there. I put it in a similar class as Shrek but at least Shrek had enough nuances to keep an adult interested. I found Avatar to be an appalling plagiarisation of other movies and themes that were wrapped up in enhanced 3D and CGI. My daughter enjoyed it and may even think Unobtainium is a real substance.<br/><br/>I promptly forgot Avatar until I watched Prometheus the other day and was appalled by its quality. It is not as bad as Avatar but I learned that Ridley Scott is re-making Bladerunner. Given the James Cameron/Scott connection with the Alien franchise I checked on Avatar and find it has an approval rating of 8! How can that be? I thought I had forgotten Avatar until I saw Prometheus, now I am seriously afraid. Are we going to be dictated to in terms of our cinema viewing by uneducated, vacuous, titillated audiences who would not have a clue about history, science, reality, plot and character, and intelligent entertainment? God help us. Avatar sucks as does Prometheus, and I am a huge Alien/Bladerunner/Gladiator fan. What next; the Kardashians find a cure for cancer? Unleash Hell!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">So it seems that Avatar is a great spectacle but lacks any real charm or white to make it go the whole 10 yards.<br/><br/>Avatar was a the most hyped 2009 film by James Cameron to be seen as a truely wonderful film but comes off as shallow as possible. More shallow than Bayformers.<br/><br/>This movie basically rips off all the classics and history. Dances with Wolves, Smurfs, The Lion King, Atlantis, Pocahontas. Avatar does this on a grand scale.<br/><br/>THE PLOT\n",
       " So the plot of Avatar goes as such. There is a planet with a very unobtainable substance so unobtainable they called it Unobtanium. Yeah, imagine that? Its could end the Iraq war but instead fuels it. The story There is handicrippled military man. From the waist down. But to get his one shot at life he becomes an avatar robot and he is very happy and adamant about it. So he befriends one of the very sexy sexy sexy alien girls who lives in a tribe like every other tribe ever in a film. But then there is the evil whiteman general who wants nothing more than to take advantage of the poor natives. This leads to battle and betrayal. Honestly this story is so cookie cutter and stale it could have been out of a grade school Houton Mifflin study guide and even then it can't Brush up. It's very cliche but hey at least it means well. Sort of. It's very pandering but kinda cute. There is a ton of fun action to go around also. It's really cool.<br/><br/>VISUALS\n",
       " The visuals of Avatar are some of the most stunning 3D CGI I have ever seen in a film. It must have taken years for them to render this. The anatomy of the space horses and aliens and other things. The art style is very 80's. The jungles are lush and full of life. Everything feels real and colorful. Very glowy where other movies prior with this aesthetics would be corny and kill the film itself or just be for kids.<br/><br/>SOUND\n",
       " The dialogue in this movie is rather dated and cheeseball. Feeling something out of a Arnold Schwarzenegger flick than a sophisticated film. The music is very epic though.<br/><br/>OVERALL\n",
       " Avatar is an ambitious movie but isn't really that good. It's all graphics and fun but a movie I have seen many times before. And ones that are far better with an environmentalist message.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">***Spoilers ahead*** <br/><br/>I was having a pretty lousy day when I entered the cinema yesterday. And despite James Cameron being one of my favorite directors and Aliens being one of my absolute favorite movies of all time, I was not sure about Avatar. The criticism has been about the story so naturally I was worried that this one would be all fluff but no substance. After having seen the film I can gladly report that is not the case, rather I would say the story and its themes is one of the stronger points about the movie, not considering the fantastic special effects.<br/><br/>It seems unnecessary to recap the story since I'm sure you've all heard it a thousand times by now. To point out a few things about it that no one seems to have talked about I would think is a better thing. All of James Cameron's movies are in some way about dreams. He frequently uses his personal dreams as inspiration for his films, perhaps most famously the idea for the Terminator which he got from a fever dream. This motif is used to its fullest extent in Avatar, where Jake Sully's journeys with his avatar body are like dreams from which he has to wake up. It all takes a fascinating meta-level when you think about our mediated world today and how many things we do just to get away from our real lives: Playing video games, drinking alcohol and of course - going to the movies. The very final scene of the movie is a clear nod to this notion. One could view Jake Sully's very physical disability as an analogy to any sort of disability or disadvantage that would keep a person from doing what they want. In the dream world that Jake flees to he has everything he ever wanted; Adventure, a beautiful potential love interest, \"people\" or rather Na'vi who care about him and so on. In the grey, cold and lifeless world he comes from, he is just \"meat on wheels\"; A nobody.<br/><br/>The movie actually leaves you with a bitter sweet feeling. Nobody's existence on this planet can be as wonderful as living on Pandora, much like Jake Sully you don't want to \"wake up\", but after 166 minutes you have no choice. Thank God you have the option of seeing the film again which I will do for sure, wallet-raping ticket prices for the 3D version or not. It certainly is worth it.<br/><br/>People think the characters are thin and the story is clichéd and predictable, but I could not agree less on all points. To me it seems like a conspiracy, an attempt to bring the film down. I've seen a lot of movies in my days but most of the time I could not predict what was going to happen. The critics seem to be mistaking narrative means of telling a story with clichés. More than anything, the use of familiar themes and shapes for the animals and so on, is a sign of good storytelling by letting the audience recognize the familiar and thereby relate to the film on another level.<br/><br/>In the above tirade about Avatar's story I have not said much about the special effects in the film which of course are outstanding, but they are very seldom there as anything more than a means to an end, just like in any good science fiction film. The same goes for the 3D, they are never just a gimmick where they point something straight into your face, it's just there to add to the whole experience. Avatar is far from a perfect movie, you could easily cut about 30 minutes out of the film and still tell the same story, and some moments are cringe-worthy. But as an experience, which to me is what movies ultimately are about, there is simply nothing that compares to Avatar.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Okay... let's take it from the top.<br/><br/>The movie opens with some fairly direct and uninspiring narration. (Cliche count: 1) An ex-marine who's lost the use of his legs, and his twin brother, get sent to another planet for a fresh start. The planet Pandora contains some incredibly valuable resource that makes it worth the time and energy everyone expends to get there. There's an indigenous population that lives on top of a major deposit of this rare resource. (Cliche count: 2)<br/><br/>The Avatar program puts people's minds in the bodies of half-alien, half-human hybrids to better relate to the natives. Our hero is one of these people, and instantly goes bonkers-happy at being able to use his legs again. (Cliche count: 3)<br/><br/>The other characters include a nerdy little buddy who's excited about everything. (Cliche count: 4) The base commander, who's an irrepressible douche because he's a hardened marine with no emotion. (Cliche count: 5) There's lead scientist lady who's a bitch outwardly, but a bleeding-heart liberal inwardly. Not sure that's a cliché yet, so we'll let that slide. There's the hot, tough fighter pilot chick who says stuff like \"five by five\" and shows off cleavage at every possible opportunity. (Cliche count: 6)<br/><br/>Now here's where the movie really gets moving. Our hero, in his Avatar body, stumbles across a great big monster that makes him run away and get lost in the jungle. (Cliche count: 7) Where he is alone, unarmed, and is being watched by the natives. One of them takes aim at him with a bow and arrow, but decides to spare his life because a dandelion puff lands on the end of her bow. So, instead, she saves him from death, then treats him like garbage because he's an outsider who doesn't know the ways of the forest. (Cliche count: 8) She takes him back to her village. (Cliche count: 9) There, he finds out that she's the chief's daughter. (Cliche count:10) And she is next in line to be high priestess like her mother. (Cliche count:11) Her betrothed is an insufferable jackass to the outsider, and wants to kill him immediately, (Cliche count:12) but her mother intercedes and says that she must show him the ways of the tribe so he will understand them better. (Cliche count:13)<br/><br/>Well, when our hero wakes up, the General wants him to use his in to get Intel, the scientists want him to use his in to improve relations, and the annoying, one-dimensional corporate ass who runs the operation wants to just bulldoze the natives to grab his valuable rocks. (Cliche count: 14)<br/><br/>Ooookay... that takes us through the first 25 minutes. Only two hours more to go!! And it goes on like this. I invite you to watch this movie with a notepad and pen, and count the clichés. I cannot understand why this movie is so amazingly acclaimed. It it because it fills a plot we've already seem before with extraordinarily expensive, stunning visuals?<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm gonna rush through to the end here. Hero learns the way of the tribe, recreates the fairy sex scene from Ferngully, lands the chief's daughter, then tells them they have to leave as the bulldozers are on the way, they try to kill him, the marines try to kill him, the scientists try to help him. They end up in a cell, the pilot chick busts them out, Sigourney Weaver dies. They go back to the tribe, our hero bags and tames some giant pteradactle and earns their respect enough to lead the various clans in an epic battle against the evil humans... of which, he is one.<br/><br/>They fight. It looks pretty. The Marines lose. Our hero gets transferred into the body of his avatar permanently. He likes it. Everything works out fine for everyone...<br/><br/>Except the human beings.<br/><br/>My cliché counter explodes. The End.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar. A word of Indian origin means a new-body-life of God to save the people from a crisis. One of the vedic lords named Krishna said to have ten such Avatars, each occur in different occasions. Here Cameron's Sci-fi Avatar is of biotech.<br/><br/>Planets and Systems: In 2154, humans are able to travel to 'Alpha Centauri' a solar system closest (4.5 Light Years; Light travels 3 Lakh Km / sec. If Light travels for one year that distance traveled is called 'one Light Year'.) to our solar system. This solar system has two suns and Pandora is the fictional moon around a gas planet Polyphemus. As per the story this moon has earth-like ecosystem and inhabited by aliens called 'Navis' who look like humans but about 12 feet tall and have tails and bluish skin tones. Its atmosphere is not hostile to humans except that the air can be inhaled by humans using a mask that filters out the poisonous elements. <br/><br/>Bacground: A team of scientists and military security forces of a company called RDA, travel to Pandora to unearth a rare metal called 'Unobtaniam' that is very costlier than even Titanium because of its super-class properties. They travel for three years to reach Pandora. Build a ground-station there with all their giant earth excavating machinery plus helicopters weaponry, missile aircrafts. There they encounter the 12-feet tall local inhabitants(aliens) called 'Navis'. Navis are bluish people living greenish life i.e. they live blended with nature. Each Navi clan lives under a giant tree about 500 ft high. There are about 12 such trees in Pandora. The 'Unobtanium' reserve lies under these 'sacred trees'. Now humans want to drive these Navi tribes out of their trees so that they can excavate Unobtanium 'freely'. <br/><br/>The head of the Scientists group (Sigourney Weaver) says instead of using forces to tame Navis, humans should learn their language and ways and teach our ways to Navis and then make a cordial relationship. With this motive the scientists create 'Navi' bodies (called Avatars) by mixing the DNAs of Navi and humans and develop a way to teleport a human's consciousness into the 'Navi' and hope to make better contacts with 'Navi' people. Even some 'Navi' people learn and speak English but Navis are unaware of Human's actual intentions.<br/><br/>Story: A paraplegic marine (Sam Worthington) goes to Pandora to be an 'Avatar'. He goes as a Navi and gets a chance to live with them for about five months and learn their ways. He finally becomes one among them. However, the RDA determines that the scientist's efforts of 'peaceful acquisition' has become a failure and moves to straight attack of the Navi people. What happens next is the course of the movie.<br/><br/>James Cameron is a person of perfection. This movie reached great heights in motion capture graphics technology. They invented a new technique WETA for film-directing such a film with full of graphics images blended with characters. The Navis all are 3D graphic images. The story line is a very bold one. For e.g. see the dialog of the corporate's security colonel \"We will fight terror with terror\". It obviously was the statement of Bush on Iraq and Afghan war. Here it is Alien Tribes Vs Corporate Humans. <br/><br/>All the actors, editing, photography and music all were in place exactly. No place for great performances. But still the performances are all better. The wonderful thing is the idea and creation of the Pandora world, its people, its creatures and the territory. Very powerful imagination. Goto wikipedia page to find more elaborate details of this hard work http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film).<br/><br/>This is another milestone in Hollywood Cinema laid by James Cameron. Imagine directing a scene of Pandora, a non-existing planet, visualizing it only in your mind. No original actors present! No surroundings exist! Too hard.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">More than a decade after his record breaking blockbuster Titanic, James Cameroon is back with Avatar!<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer, the name \"James Cameroon\"{after all he directed my favourite movie ever - Terminator 2} was enough for me to get excited and though the trailer was decent I was a bit skeptical regarding the acting of Zoe Saldana {she looked a little cocky in the trailer and the dialogue delivery seemed poor} but I'm glad the film turned out to be very good and most of the actors did a good job.<br/><br/>Avatar is not a film but a breath taking visual experience. The creative imagination of James Cameroon is so spectacular that it can't be described in words and would me more appropriate if you yourself experience the astonishing forests of Pandora. I expected to visualize a new world with extraordinary creatures {creatures of Pandora were truly amazing, some of them are etched in my memory}, new language and decent script. I got what I expected. The background music/sound effects are also pretty solid. 3D just adds to the viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>People may complain there was no character development, stereotyped characters, clichéd story, plot holes, weak dialogue{I agree with this up to a certain extent} etc. BUT I say just sit back, relax and let the director take you on an unforgettable journey.<br/><br/>Will it revolutionize cinema? Can't say,it probably won't but that doesn't take anything away from this masterpiece. Are the special effects worth the hype? You betcha, CGI is flat-out AMAZING. Is it worth the time and money? Yes, its worth every penny.<br/><br/>I saw this in 3D at Imax but 3D or 2D this film should not be missed.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Amazing. I don't know where to start. The CGI,action,romance, cinematography,directing,writing,everything is perfect. Everything is so detailed. James Cameron has created a masterpiece. The world of Pandora is so detailed and colorful, it almost feels as if it's real. The characters are likable even though it seems James Cameron spent more time developing the Na'vi characters than the human ones. The emotional part of the movie is like Cameron's previous movie, Titantic. It has the same romantic style. The Military or mercs remind me of Cameron's other movie, Aliens. The only problem I had with it was the acting was a little weak. But still this is a feast for the eyes and heart.Definitely in my top 5 favorite movies of the year and probably in my top 20 of all time. Movies will never be the same. I saw it twice in theaters(both in 3D and bought the DVD and Blu-Ray the day it came out. I was very surprised to find out it's actually better on an HD TV.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I'm sure even before you started to read this review you knew it was going to be a good one. But it's hard to find faults with James Cameron's Avatar. The fact that the movie has been in development since 1999 says a great deal about Cameron's determination and the sheer volume of work that went into producing this cinematic delight.<br/><br/>Avatar is a tricky one, you do actually have to pay attention and follow the plot as it happens. It's not a sit down and lounge about on the sofa movie. I'm not going to waffle on and tell you the plot though, I really don't want to ruin it for you. You can use WIkipedia or IMDb for that anyway.<br/><br/>The visuals in Avatar are just stunning. The CGI is literally flawless. So much so that it's not directly obvious that you're actually watching computer generated images, it all looks extremely realistic. Sam Worthington, of Terminator: Salvation fame, is absolutely brilliant in this, the same can be said for Sigourney Weaver, who features in the film quite surprisingly, as she isn't featured prominently on any of the promotional material.<br/><br/>There is really no reason not to watch Avatar in 3D or in an IMAX theatre, I couldn't give a completely accurate comparison of watching in 3D as opposed to 2D but the three dimensional aspect of the film worked amazingly well, people in the cinema were actually wow-ing throughout. The world of the Na'vi tribe is literally breathtaking and full of colour and life. You really do have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>http://ukmore.tk/</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar 8/10 (2 extra for visuals only)<br/><br/>Well, what I'm going to write may not please some (maximum) but remember its MY opinion only.<br/><br/>Everyone was waiting for this one, it was the next big thing in cinema milestone and it has landed.<br/><br/>Seriously, mind-blowing and awesome visuals, lots of color and play of light. A very serious care has been taken for details. Imagining a whole world and then defining its details and how should it react to environment is not a easy task. Avatar gets a full 10/10 for this. Kudos to Cameron and his team for it. But, yes but...its story, what I anticipated came true. Yes guys here who watches lots of movies (The Last Samurai specially) and play a bit games (Turok may be ;-) ) already knows what this story is. And those who are just smart and guessed something about the story watching the trailers...well u guys are correct too. Its story is exactly what u thought. Old story with some meaningless (weak logic I would like to say) twists are put into it. I'm not mentioning anything here, as it would spoil ur fun, let enough people watch it, then we can start an argument over falsifying my claims. Seriously I'm not satisfied with the story and not too impressed with 3D. I didn't get the feel of it. IMO its not a right movie to watch in 3D but ya, HD obviously only for visuals. U don't go to 3D for awesome flowers or glowing octopus like weird things, u go for action which has the power to put u directly in the middle of it, makes u feel the heat. Well there are only one/two such scenes...<br/><br/>To sum it up, Visuals=10/10 Screenplay= 5/10 (don't expect anything new, lots of loopholes and logic-less story twists/progress) Directing= 7.5/10 Cinematography=10/10<br/><br/>Why should u see it, 1&gt;visuals 2&gt;visuals 3&gt;visuals 4&gt;visuals 5&gt;visuals 6&gt;N/A 7&gt;N/A 8&gt;N/A 9&gt;Acting 10&gt;Story</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This film has clearly raised the bar with regard to computer generated special effects. I had previously never been a fan of the CGI technology. While it has allowed film possibilities that could not have occurred without it, the CGI scenes have always left me with the feeling that I was watching a cartoon....<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" has showed us that there is no longer anything, effects wise, that cannot be put into a film. Further, this movie does it in breathtakingly seamless fashion. The planet Pandora and its creatures are simply gorgeous and relatively believable. The action scenes are breathtaking.<br/><br/>Now to the story. This is simply another tired remake of the \"Western civilization (primarily the USA) raping mother earth and exploiting noble indigenous peoples\" theme. I am so tired of this simplistic and hypocritical leftist style of film, that were it not for the awe inspiring visuals in the movie, I would have only given it two or three stars out of ten.<br/><br/>There is nothing whatsoever original about this plot. Combine \"Dances with Wolves\" and \"Ferngully\", and you have the story for \"Avatar\".<br/><br/>Nothing more needs to be said. If you buy into this simplistic sort of preaching, you will love the movie without hesitation. If you, like me, are tired of it, I can still recommend the film as a spectacular visual experience.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">it wasn't even close to matching my expectations and it wasn't able to match how much i hoped i would have enjoyed it. My problems with Avatar are that i find it hard to believe that James Cameron spent 12 years making and planning this, it lacked passion, also it had a poor script, and very weak and amateur dialogue, cinematography should had been better and had an opening sequence which was just Bad! But by the end it got better, it begun to look pretty amazing and even the story concept began to improve, the effects were just Brilliant and Cameron begun to show sightly more skills but i still left Avatar disappointed. I feel i could had preferred it but the story structure was too poor and it was too reliant on special effects and that isn't what movies should be about</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is certainly a visually spectacular film. The CGI effects are very good, but much of it still feels like watching a cartoon. CGI has a long way to go to replicate real life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film lacks a sound plot and fully developed characters. Neither omission is acceptable in such a major film. To have neither makes this feel even more like a cartoon.<br/><br/>Worse, there is a plethora of character stereotypes, from the gung ho marine colonel, the military pilot with a conscience, the bureaucrat carrying out the dictates of the evil corporation, to the peaceful ecologically-minded (though blue rather than green!) tree-hugging spiritualist Indians (sorry Na'vi). This collection shows a pretty poor imagination, and a serious lack of originality.<br/><br/>Then there are the major plot defects and goofs. The major ones (and they are really major errors) are listed separately.<br/><br/>All in all a deeply flawed movie. It may have cost as much as the California budget deficit to make, and the publicity may have been even more expensive than the film, but I doubt its reputation will stand the test of time.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Went to go see Avatar today in 3D. Honestly it is definitely being overrated because I felt it had great potential but it lacked in the storyline too much. And it was extensively long. I am a huuuge Sci-Fi fan, and by far the movies like Pandorum, with Denis Quaid, and District 9 were the best Sci-Fi movies of this year, Not Avatar. Although the visual effects of the Pandorum wasn't the best but it had a really strong storyline. But District 9 had a excellent storyline and a great visual effects. Avatar on the other hand had good visual effects but not impressive storyline at all. Basically it was cartoon 3D made creatures mixed with humans. The only thing is that the director used a lot of Lumna filter in the whole movie, which made everything glow too much.<br/><br/>If you closely watch District 9, you will clearly realize the magnificent details of the Aliens. It felt so real watching District 9. But Avatar seemed really fake. My friend just bought the PS3 game of Avatar, and trust me it looks exactly the same as movie effects. So my point is, its basically has graphics like a video game, only little more sharper.<br/><br/>If I were you, I would save that $15 ticket, and rather wait for a better Sci-Fi movie. I have high hopes for Clash of Titans, hopefully its not as disappointing as this one was.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar. The movie everyone's been talking about. The movie that literally almost everyone has already watched. The so-far second biggest box-office success of all time. Winner of two Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Picture. Nominated for 8 BAFTA's. The most probable candidate for this year's Oscar. And I finally got the chance to watch it on IMAX last Thursday. And now I'm gonna post my review.<br/><br/>Avatar is set on the year of 2154, when the humans are colonizing and exploring a planet called Pandora. To do so, the humans created a alien/human hybrid called Avatars, in order to talk to aliens and interact with them. There are many races and animals that live in Pandora, but the main ones are the Na'Vi, a people really connected to the nature. But the movie really tells the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex-marine that is forced to substitute his twin brother who had just died and use his Avatar. But he likes the Na'Vi people so much that he now has to choose between being with the Na'Vi or coming back to the humans. The plot seems very complex and interesting, but after some time it becomes cliché and predictable. That's why the script is the main problem I have with this movie. By the end, it already had lots of cheesy lines like: 'Mother nature heard your calling', or 'I don't make the rules. Talk to the stockholders'. <br/><br/>There isn't much to comment on the acting here, because there isn't one role in this movie that gives room to the actor to do his best. And it's also hard to act when you're a blue bean. Overral, the acting here is just the way it should be and the way you'd expect: non-existing.<br/><br/>James Cameron does a really great job directing this picture. he uses the new 3-D technology in a remarkable way. But the best thing about this movie is the art-direction and the special effects. Pandora feels so alive and breathing, all the new species are different and unique. The special effects are also really impressive. James Cameron and his crew were able to achieve a level of realism never seen before. Although it still has that ultra video game feel to it, it's the best cinematic experience you can see as of 2010. <br/><br/>The new technologies developed for the making of this movie and the enhancement of the already-existent ones transforms this movie into a true landmark on cinematic history. Watch it on 3-D is truly an unforgettable experience. But the cliché script keeps this movie alway from been a masterpiece and winning any category on the awards if not the technical ones. Because technically, this movie is perfect. Even for today's standards.<br/><br/>8/10</div>,\n",

I don't know anyone who could have done effects like that. Just incredible! And if you dare Dis the CGI...LET'S SEE YOU TRY TO MAKE EFFECTS AS GOOD AS THIS! The plot is simple, about a man named Jake Sulley (Sam Worthington) who is replacing his brother's position in the army in regards to the fact that his brother has died. Jake has an Avatar body and he must discover the inside of the Avatars and gain their trust. The head Sargent in charge (Stephen Lang) is promising Jake a great reward if he can tell him how to gain their trust and then lead the rest of the army to them so they can kill them! But Jake doesn't want this. He wanted to help the Avatar people and stop Stephen Lang from killing them.<br/><br/>The lady Avatar Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) is the one Jake falls in love with. Zoe Saldana was so good at this performance! She proves she has great talent and can act Oscar Worthy. At times she had the theater in tears. She even had me in tears at one point. I really believed that she was serious...but she was acting! Excellent actress! Hope to see more of her! All in all a great film and i would watch it 600 times a year until the day i die! great/fantastic movie and flop or no flop it's number 1 movie on my list! 10/10!</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's virtual creation deserves it formidable success due to our recognition of it. Avatar changed the perception of film, enlightened the use of 3D technology beyond any other film and placed us in a wonderful landscape. It has acquired multiple criticisms, this a considerable amount with regards to the films topical depiction and suffering with a poor narrative. In response, James Cameron's biggest challenge paid off, the narrative was never a key component. Taking the audience to a new world exhumes spectators; we are intrigued by the possibility of the discovery of an alternative to Earth. Although every film employs a critique, Avatar is equally a sign of and an active influence with regards to our existing culture.<br/><br/>Cameron's virtual world can be rectified as the interpretation to the limits of technology. There is the possibility of the human race entering such a fundamental experience in the near future with the launch of four dimensional cinema and the vast increase in picture releases in 3D. Maybe Cameron's Avatar's are a preview of the future. This seems a little extreme, but altogether possible with the likelihood of technological expansion. The protagonist, Jake (Sam Worthington), is a deliberate example of the prospect by transferring himself from a disabled fragile body to a secondary being that promises potential and accompanied with a strong nature.<br/><br/>Avatar adopts and reinterprets a range of genres and styles. It is incontestably a produce of post-colonialism; it portrays the Na'vi as a non detrimental tribe who are environmentally friendly and dedicated to protection. Meanwhile the military exist as a careless regime, digging for supremacy with the intent of seizing all intelligence with an overwhelming display of events, continuing to disseminate the myth of the unyielding fighter.<br/><br/>Also in this film, gender seems to go unnoticed without drawing these from a critical point of view. The protagonist, Jake Sully, although immobilised implements a strong will and is blessed with a mentally tough attitude. He is the only character with the capabilities to negotiate with the Na'vi by building a structure for them to understand his prowess and for him to comprehend with the 'savage' way of living. His love interest is fascinating to say the least and provides us with a mixture of both male and female characteristics. Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) is firm, naïve to fear but loving and loyal to the principle of family. Sigourney Weaver's intelligent biologist personality, Grace, enables us to understand the hypothetical dedication of the military visit to the native paradise. She incorporates an interactive measure to the film by reminding us of the reason behind gaining intelligence. She is the interpretation of Jake's mother or guardian, reminding him of the commitment he must endure due to his incapacity as he frequently loses himself by playfully trotting through the wonderment of the native world. He is portrayed as the avatar of the viewers, guiding them through Pandora as both he and they learn about it. Although, at first, Jake is characterised in this manner, he soon becomes our saviour character, the most competent and capable. The narrative is indicative of most Hollywood films that portray the implementation of a lost sole, by placing him into an unknown world, but developing him, therefore choosing to be one of the Na'vi.<br/><br/>The elegance of the Na'vi's wonderful physical and mental connection with nature emotionally ties us to Pandora's cognitive components and landscape. The narrative couldn't support this entirely without the influence of Cameron's fanatical technological thesis. Any story can be imaginable, but arguably without the influence of hi-tech expertise the narrative is extremely predictable even though it possesses some moral and race related themes. We have seen Avatar's narrative countless times elsewhere without the wonderful tones and magical images. James Cameron was able to build a project that has potential to become the highest grossing film of all time. This exemplifies that cultural surroundings have altered as the ideology the environment has developed into becoming mainstream. Avatar illustrates that the perfect world exists only through the influences of mediation. The film relies on this concept to a great deal, often deteriorating the importance of the tale and the audience's recognition of it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">**** CONTAINS SPOILERS******* I'd like my 3D with less cheese please Mr Cameron! I walked out of the theater with the same bitter feeling as when I saw the Star Wars prequel whatever it was called the Phantom something. The feeling of having witnessed a complete failure I wanted so badly to enjoy. It all starts with that cheesy voice over. Usually a bad sign, but I was crossing my fingers the guy is a maestro, a genius, a pure talent, after all I heard in the media. 20 minutes of miserable acting and unbelievably lame lines that belong to a B TV series later, I start doubting the reviews. Characters who are supposed to have been living together for months start explaining to each other why they are here, who they are etc... in a very contrived and unsophisticated way that make it all very laughable. The hero is played by a bloke who belongs to an afternoon TV series, and is described as a stupid marine. Impossible to even start liking him. I started asking myself whether the genius had made a comedy. But no, the rest of the picture was undoubtedly first degree cheese. We were not supposed to laugh. Then this big animal a giant black alien panther with 6 legs comes out of the jungle for a chase, I cheer up: the masterpiece starts here! A cool chase in the woods, our hero is separated from his patrol without means of communication and runs for his life in the jungle. His patrol leaves him behind. There is nothing they can do. The hero miraculously escapes by jumping in a waterfall. You'd think that his fellow soldiers would deem him dead after leaving him alone to deal with a giant panther in the middle of a an unknown jungle. No. The officer as if he had seen the movie fears: \"he won't make it through the night\". That's when I started thinking that there was something deeply rotten in Avatar: the script. It feels it has been written in a rush or by a talentless beginner, or someone whose power in the project was such that nobody would dare tell him the blinding truth: if you are over 12 years old, you cannot believe one minute of Avatar because it's too cheesy. The script is not at par with the budget, nor the CGI . The fact that it makes so much money at the box will certainly make the author(s) brush any criticism away. Regardless of the box, avatar is a scandal of a script. Then the rest of the movie is just a confirmation that what makes a bad movie is a bad story. It becomes an endless retelling of Dances with wolves, itself a cheesy retelling of Little big man etc. As usual it needs a white man to tell the Indians how to fight back, they're too under-developed, naive and primitive you see. With a few differences: the Indians are now the color the soldiers of the cavalry used to be, ie blue, they have rastafari dreadlocks, cats eyes and mouse ears and they are saved not only by Kevin Costner but also by the buffalos this time. The Buffalos join forces as they have learned their lesson: they understand what Buffalo Bill will do to them later on if they don't do anything. Many similarities still with your usual John Wayne western: the horses, the broncos they tame, the arrows the costumes and the squaws. But no Wayne. No actors at all. Our tasteless hero is accepted by the Indians, God only knows why, no explanation is given, except their sheer stupidity and he is taught how to become an Indian himself through a 30 minutes montage of boring sequences with no dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is the usual celebration of testosterone and violence, the usual Hollywood dubious self-defense violence you find in any action movies except this one is lecturing us on its anti violence anti war stance. It still exploits an hour of pure violence to make money. End of story: the usual showdown between our dummy boy hero and the baddie, a ridiculous body builder GI Joe. A movie is as good as its baddie, Disney used to say . Well look at the baddie here: you'll know how bad Avatar is. The hero saves the Indians who without him would be toast, they're so crass and stupid, those \"savages\", a stupid marine makes all the difference. I watched all this mess with a pair of heavy 3D glasses which darken the picture and leave a mark on your nose so everybody you meet within the next two hours ask you whether you've just seen avatar, it's so red in the middle of your face. They say it's 21st century cinema. It may well be, but when the novelty of the technique wears off, they'd better start hiring scriptwriters. I am not going back any time soon. I don't care about the 3D, I want to see a good movie please! The quality of the dialogs and the fun of the Ice Age or Nemo make those cartoons enjoyable for all. Avatar is only for kids who enjoy violent video games and do not care for any story or characters. I heard people say Avatar is beautiful. Avatar's conception of beauty is \"when it glows in the dark\". Like stars you stick on kids bedrooms ceilings. I'm way too old for fluorescent deco. There is good news in Avatar's box office: it is probably scaring the hell out of LA talent agencies who got used to making millions off star power. People seem happy with 3D without cast. It may be the only 21st century news in the picture.</div>,\n",

Spend hundreds of millions of dollars, we need realistic effects! We suffer from obsessive-compulsive overused CGI disorder! etc etc.\n",
       " Seriously, with all that CGI business, this could have been great if it aimed to another direction - a documentary; Instead of one-dimensional characters, one-dimensional plot and a one-dimensional storyline, try to make it more thrilling and interesting! Remember \"Alien Planet\" or the awesome series from \"The future is wild\"? That's what I'm talking about! Fantasy, imagination and science. So, I wanted to know about the gas giant planet Polyphemus and its tropical moon Pandora; I wanted to know about the spaceships that traveled there; I wanted to know more about the biology of the creatures and a possible classification of all the organisms, about the weather systems, pedology, geology etc. The movie barely tells you anything; sure, you could do some research and see the science behind \"Avatar\", but I wanted to hear this in the movie!\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Went to see the movie last Saturday at the local I.M.A.X. This is the first chance I have had to write the review, even though the movie and its impact on me has been in the back of my mind since the experience.<br/><br/>Experience is the word, this movie is epic, beautiful, engaging, exhilarating and quite simply fantastical.<br/><br/>The slight extra cost to view the film (IMAX 3D) was worth every penny and a load more.<br/><br/>Visuals are simply stunning from the off. The 3D is extremely impressive from the start and instantly you are emerged in the movie/experience.<br/><br/>Yes the story is the same story we have read/seen many times, however the way its presented and told is very well done. Good pacing, great direction and an brilliant score help the 3hrs pass in a flash.<br/><br/>So is the movie the groundbreaking event its hyped to be? Well you will have NEVER seen anything quite like this before, so in that respect it is. The effects are almost perfect excluding a couple of frames here and there.<br/><br/>James Cameron just knows how to entertain, arguably better than any modern day director/movie maker? Avatar is yet another strong tick in his resume. Personally this could be my favourite Cameron movie in fact.<br/><br/>There is nothing I didn't like or enjoy about Avatar. All the cast were fantastic, even though some where only CGI character they still did a great job. Nobody in the production of this movie let the side down.<br/><br/>10/10 An epic of the modern day. Quite simply puts a lot of \"event movies\" to shame. Watch this then watch Transformers 2. Night and day.<br/><br/>The King of the World is BACK.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In this day and age of movies being overrun with computer-generated (CG) images, it's easy to get complacent about big films that have tremendous amounts of CG effects—especially if the effects are there to be eye candy and are so loud they distract the viewer from the film. However, every once in a while, a film is done that properly utilizes these resources and makes a film that is awe-inspiring in its visuals. Avatar is one of those films. Going into viewing it, I was rather complacent about it. I have seen plenty of films that utilize CG effects that end up, in my view, being eye candy. The marriage of animated or CG characters and live action characters in a film reached new heights with this film. Who Framed Roger Rabbit did it best, for me, until Avatar. Avatar's visual effects are very realistic, and do not distract you from the film. However, other aspects of the film also support the realism of the visual effects.<br/><br/>The writing of this film, while not the most original, is very creative and is stated excellently by the performers cast. The story itself borrows from Pocahontas the most. Humans moving on to a new world in search of a precious metal, and indigenous people are in between them and the wealth they seek. Despite the somewhat lack of originality in the basis of the film's story, the way it is interpreted and portrayed is most outstanding. Very few films can truly get me emotionally involved with the characters, and this film did that down to a T. The cast excellent. They all were amazing, which is why I am not going to name specific individuals. To bring true life and humanity to a CG-character is a mark of a truly talented performer, and those who did it in this film truly did it better than anyone I have seen before.<br/><br/>A lot of times, huge films like this tend to lose their impact when viewed on a television screen as opposed to the big screen. I must say, even Titanic did that. But, this film, like T2, retains almost all of its vitality on the television screen, although there is just no substitute for seeing this on the big screen (I am sure of it despite not having experienced it there, with much regret). However, this film is truly up there with the likes of Star Wars, The Godfather (yes, I am dead serious about it) and Citizen Kane. It is definitely a true gem, and I truly believe this is a film we will (hopefully, if we are around for it) be showing our children, grandchildren and so on. This film is truly a mark of what happens when much time, care and talent is invested into something—a quality result is produced. Avatar is destined to be a classic film. Hands down a 10/10. A must see.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The only good thing about this film is the visuals other than that it's a poorly written and extremely weak story. I don't even know how this got made.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"If we give up this land and transfer it to you, you must remember that this land is sacred.\"<br/><br/>In 1854, an Indian chief wrote these words to \"the great chief in Washington, d.c.\" He and his people have fought the last of their strength, the young hunters have died, the old and infirm are sick... No one heard their cries and howls, no one cared about the ancient tribe that was on the brink of extinction. The chief had seen the end of the story: no more, no more... The land, the ancestral land... Wave after wave of white settlers appeared on the horizon with their rifles...<br/><br/>\"They will come, like the never-ending rain.\" (movie avatar)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">As a spectacle, you can't fault Avatar. However, if it hadn't been made by Cameron, I'd reckon Kevin Costner's lawyers would be sharpening their pencils! <br/><br/>The similarity in plot between Dancing with Wolves and this is so startling I just am in awe of James Cameron's audacity. The 'Indians' even use bow and arrows and have witch doctors for God's sake! Anyway, the special effects are very good. <br/><br/>The story-line, however, is weaker than you'd expect for a movie this big. None of the characters really live .. though that's not to say the actors don't do a pretty good job. It's just that none of the characters has any heart and so it's difficult if not impossible for viewers to identify with anyone. The 'western society invade peaceful pastoral society' motif is so overdone that's it's almost a parody of itself these days. I can believe Cameron started this ten years ago because that's about where the level of maturity is rooted.<br/><br/>Disappointing but okay.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie had so many special effects. It seems magical. The storyline is really good too. A different population and also about being different. Which makes people afraid of the unknown. Really a beautiful fantasy world to dream about. I can watch this movie 100 times.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">....Cameron sets the standards....back in the 80's a revolutionary movie called \"The Terminator\" changed the way action movies should be....a decade later \"Terminator 2\" changed the way FX should be.....later \"Titanic\" made a whole generation travel deep into the ocean and history.....now \"Avatar\" had taken a whole generation into the future of film-making. Imagine \"Star Wars\" or The Lord of the Ring\" with this technology. The film is simply put \"Amazing\"...there is nothing wrong with it....the acting is good the FX are out of this world...the story though is bit predictable and probably done before..really, there was nothing original about the plot....but who cares...it wasn't about the storyline...Cameron showed the world he can deliver a good story with \"Titanic\"....this movie was about a trip...from the way movies are make today to the way movies will be make from now on. An amazing experience that should be seen in big screen.....3 hours well spent. Definitely the best movie in the last decade.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I was lucky enough to see this in IMAX 3D, and for what amounted to about 8 USD. I had felt that much of the hoopla about \"game-changer\" and \"enter the world\" was just that - marketing. How wrong I was. This is really an amazing, immersive visual experience. Much of that has to do with how the visual effects are used (in technology terms), quite apart from their actual quality and magnitude.<br/><br/>From the trailers you just cant tell what this is actually going to be like. It looks pretty, but not so very novel, and maybe even a little disappointing. While what we get in the theatre is of another visual order. The third dimension allows for a presentation of objects that the flat screen simply cannot. Thats what seems to have worked in its favor - people going in with reduced expectations and then coming away stunned by the actual experience. Because the WAY in which photo-real CGI and stereoscopy (i.e. 3D) are combined is the key to this new threshold for visual verisimilitude.<br/><br/>Think about the worlds that we saw in the Pirates and Spiderman movies, the Rings movies, the Harry Potter films, even the Matrix trilogy. Compare that to what we see in Avatar. Credit must be given where it is due, and the fact is that very little of what we've seen earlier compares with this film. This is essentially a different approach - they've actually created a new world out of whole cloth, and they found new ways to deliver this world visually, in spatial terms. The director's intentions - that the viewer should feel no distinction between real and artificial, that photo-real CGI should necessarily surmount the Uncanny Valley - these are achieved, at least to a far greater degree than anything we've seen before.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the story and characters are as banal as everyone reported. I was shocked at how unmoving this was non-visually. This completely fails to engage on an emotional or thematic level. I actually felt that 300 was far more emotionally rousing, and thats pretty damning. Both the story and the storytelling were needlessly trite. Why ?? Was it a deliberate strategy to aim for the \"broadest common denominator\" ?<br/><br/>For now I believe we should see this as an experiment that largely succeeds visually. That it does not do so in other ways, that it does not enter our minds and souls, is hardly the point. This is a new way of doing things, and it is only the beginning. What James Cameron and others are doing is freeing the filmmaker from the bounds of hardware and physicality. A film can now truly be ANYTHING the filmmaker wants it to be - that seems to be the promise realized by Lightstorm and Weta. Think about when someone like David Fincher or Tarsem Singh or Zack Snyder get their hands on this technology. Someday someone will integrate narrative, imagery and music in the \"new way\", and we as viewers will greatly evolve in our conceptual reasoning abilities. Audiences did not necessarily appreciate the water tentacle in The Abyss for what it was. But recall what came after that : the T-1000.<br/><br/>Dear Lord. Fox gives this guy half a billion to make a film with untested methods, and it becomes the highest grossing film ever. Unbelievable</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron has never directed a bad - or even mediocre - motion picture; this is the guy who has brought us such classics as the first two Terminators, Aliens - one of the best sequels of all time -, True Lies - exceptional action movie - and, of course, Titanic. That's why, despite some negative buzz, I was always pretty sure his latest endeavor, Avatar, was going to be something else. Maybe not a \"game changer\", as many - including Cameron himself - have been saying, but certainly something that we haven't seen before.<br/><br/>Well, I still am not sure if this is a \"game changer\", but it certainly is \"something else.\"<br/><br/>Avatar is the most visually impressive and most immersive motion picture I've seen in some time. Not since Peter Jackson released the last of the Lord of the Rings movies has someone marveled me in such an amazing way, transporting me into a different land where - apparently - anything is possible. So maybe the story Cameron is telling is not 100% original, but the way in which he tells it certainly is. I haven't seen the movie in 3D - I will on Saturday and a review will follow - and I imagine it must be impressive, but even while watching it on 2D I can't imagine anyone not being marveled and feel inspired by what Cameron has created. This is one epic, epic film - an event and an experience unlike anything I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Performances are quite solid. The real scene-stealer is Stephen Lang, whose Quaritch is one of the most effective villains I've seen in some time. We know he is the villain not only because the screenplay tells us so, but because Lang makes the character his own, a real sonofabitch who knows no compassion and no mercy. He never goes over-the-top and avoids turning his character into a caricature. (Although he is larger-than-life.) Sam Worthington is pretty good as Jake Sully - although his \"American\" accent is less-than-stellar - and Sigourney Weaver is memorable as Dr. Augustine. On the other hand, Zoe Saldana has a tougher job - Weaver and Worthington appear both in human and Na'avi form, but Saldana's character appears only as the former. No problem, though - her performance - with the aid of performance capture - is strong enough to make the audience believe in her. Like Gollum in the Lord of the Rings pictures, the audience believe in the Na'avi - we believe they are real characters who breath, cry, laugh and can even die, not just a bunch of pretty-looking cartoons.<br/><br/>But what about the spectacle? Despite all the drama and the romance, Cameron has actually managed to deliver action-wise - if there is someone in Hollywood who truly knows how to portray the right balance between action, special effects, character development and story, it is Cameron. Simply put, the film is breath-taking. Despite being approximately 60% CGI, there was never a moment in which I was aware that I was watching big, powerful computers at work. There isn't one - not a single one - fake-looking shot. Pandora is simply beautiful, and all the creatures - including of course the Na'avi - are amazing and totally believable. The way Cameron has populated his world is, simply put, worthy of applause - every single plant, creature, monster, predator, everything is credible and awesome-looking, showing that Cameron is talented at both creating great stories and characters and using his vivid, visual and fantasy-based imagination.<br/><br/>And there is the difference between a masterpiece like Avatar and a mindless product like Transformers 2: the viewer actually believes in all the computer-generated creatures, characters and locations, accepting them as real and believing they actually exist, even when they appear on-screen at the same time with flesh-and-blood characters. Unlike the soul-less Michael Bay movie, Avatar has spirit and charm, and never bores. Yes, there is action, but it is not mindless because there are incredibly high stakes at hand, and because we feel for the characters. There are a lot of ridiculously tense moments in Avatar because of this - on the other hand, I didn't even flinch while watching Transformers 2. (And if I did, it was because the action scenes were almost incomprehensible.)<br/><br/>Since I haven't seen the film on 3D, I really don't know if Avatar truly is a \"game-changer\" or not. Why I do know, though, is that the movie is one of the most imaginative, visually-arresting and gripping motion pictures I've seen in years, and quite possibly the best film I've seen this 2009. Avatar is not simply a \"movie\" - it is a experience, something that quite literally has to be seen to be believed. It boasts a smart screenplay, it has believable and sympathetic characters, it's got the most believable and awe-inspiring special effects ever seen on the big screen, and it contains more thrills and emotions that any other film this year. I don't care that Cameron took 12 years to make this film - the final product was definitely worth the wait. I just hope that all the rumours that say Cameron plans to shoot a sequel are actually true. This is one rare case in which I just wish a second installment is actually released. (Hopefully, it won't take 12 more years.)</div>,\n",

Even assuming that the story lines here are not new..anti-war,destruction of earth's natural resources,our treatment of natives,lack of empathy for other races and cultures, still it didn't matter at all. I was mesmerized, amazed and left breathless by the 3-D effects and the gorgeous lush visuals. I also was not bored for a second even though we were in the theatre for a full three hours including previews.<br/><br/>The theatre was packed in the afternoon mostly with students and young adults. Everyone clapped at the end which you don't see too often today,given the typical drivel that is shown.<br/><br/>I think James Cameron has outdone himself. Any movie that causes goosebumps and breathlessness is certainly worth seeing in my opinion.<br/><br/>You won't be disappointed. Even though it was a bit pricey for a movie it was a wonderful movie experience.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">My thoughts on Avatar are that it is \"Ferngully\" combined with \"Dances With Wolves\" (DWW). It's still mostly a comic book though. I found quite a number of faulty plot elements, the \"flux vortex\" is just bizarre, I have no idea what that is or why it would lead to \"floating mountains.\" I even found some ideas from the old \"Barsoom\" series (John Carter - Warlord of Mars) by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Not that I didn't like it, visually, it was a treat, but I'm not going to let \"Bling\" overpower my sense that there were some faulty plot elements, and some silly dialog.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of telling the story from Jake's point of view. As he learned what was happening, so did we. There's not much sense of transition from human to alien though, just one video log he announces \"I don't know who I am anymore.\" Probably a lot of film got cut to make it to 2.75 hrs running time, so I guess that some of the missing stuff is on the editor's floor (so to speak).<br/><br/>I found so much of the plot and so forth came from an animated flick of the last generation - Ferngully - that I just kept expecting Batty-Koda to come flying out with Robin William's voice to announce that \"We're DOOMED!\" Silly, I know, but much of the visual imagery derives directly from Ferngully. The John Dunbar parallels of the film (DWW) are so obvious as to be monotone. We've seen this theme before, evil corporate empire desires to exploit and displace natives to get at \"Unobtainium.\" Was that name for real? Who the heck thought that up? Did they hold a 2nd grade challenge to come up with that one? Overall, Avatar's just one step ahead of a comic book in my opinion. Cheap Sci-Fi stuff of the 1930's, redone with some modern technology. Thus, it gets just ahead of a \"B\" movie with an 8/10 rating.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Every so often, a film comes around and jolts a stagnant industry from its lethargic state. Whether it's through spectacular screen writing, effective acting or revolutionary special effects. In this current age of nostalgic tie ins and reboots, \"Avatar\" comes and restored my love of cinema and hope for the future of movies.<br/><br/>Up front, the story is cliché' ridden backed up by shoddy screen writing. While the actors and actresses do impressive turns at their respective characters, no one is really given the material to add depth or nuance. It's a by-the-numbers plot, never straying from its established structure. If you've seen \"Dances with Wolves or \"The Last Samurai\", you'll be given a good approximation of what the story holds.<br/><br/>However, what this simple plot and structure allows for is us to be engrossed by the world of Pandora. The subtlety, detail and passion that is clearly evident in each frame of this movie is truly a sight to behold. After years of wondering what it would have felt to be one of those first audiences to watch \"Star Wars\", I finally understand. This movie shows what can be done with film. Granted, these techniques have been used time and again. But, the craftsmanship with which this film was built is a testament to the true genius and artistry that cinema is capable of.<br/><br/>So, whether or not this is a rallying cry for the auteur or it just passes in the night still remains to be seen.

The scenery is gorgeous, the aliens lack in character building from a lack of dialogue but are still fun to watch, and the CGI blends seamlessly with the live action. <br/><br/>This film is like going to a restaurant and getting a Five Star Spamburger.

With only 40% of live-action material, Cameron created a world so renown and so stunning that for over 2 and 1/2 hours our eyes are glued to the screen. Cameron has a way of allowing you to be awed by the beautiful world that is Pandora while still paying close attention to what's right in front of you. The visuals do not take away from the movie in any way. Everything is superb from start to finish. Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldana, Joel Moore, and everyone else are excellent in their respective roles. I've read some of these comments on here and can't fathom why people do not like this movie. Yes, the movie drags on a bit, but if the movie were only 2 hours long, people would complain that there was no character development or some parts were left unfinished. James Cameron takes you through Jake Sully's transformation in such a way that you actually believe in your own mind that you were watching a human being turn into something completely different, all while not missing a beat.<br/><br/>You don't have to like or dislike any of Cameron's other films in order to decide whether or not you want to see this movie. This is a masterpiece from start to finish, in every aspect of the movie. The fact that this has an 8.8 is superb but only #25 on the Top 250 is beyond me. The Dark Knight was a great movie but it does not deserve to be #9 with Bale's shotty performance (as usual).<br/><br/>Avatar may simply be one of the most artistic movies ever made, and I mean this with no exaggeration. Undoubtedly the most beautiful film I've seen since The Green Mile. Granted I've only seen The Green Mile for the first time last week, but going back to 1999, I can't think of any better movies.<br/><br/>Avatar ranks up their with the best, and it deserves to win every award that it is nominated for. Simply put, a stunning 10 out of 10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">To cut a big story short: <br/><br/>Special Effects: 10 Stars <br/><br/>Story: 4 Stars <br/><br/>I was amazed with the special effects. Watching this movie on 3D was an absolutely crazy and impressive experience. I was delighted. I was so delighted that I simply forgot how average sticky the story was, totally predictable and really uninteresting. But the effects, WOW! <br/><br/>As a friend of mine told me while we were watching the movie: \"Fuck the story!\" <br/><br/>Don't miss this new movie experience.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Seriously, people, admit it. You were captured by the film's amazing special effects, not the movie itself!! Avatar was NOT groundbreaking, it WASN'T amazing, and it definitely did NOT deserve eight out of ten stars.<br/><br/>I'll start with the one and only good thing about Avatar. I'll admit, the special effects were very realistic, and I hate to say it, beautiful. That does NOT mean that it is a good movie. And here are the reasons why:<br/><br/>1) The story- I have seen the Disney movie, Pocahontas, a couple of times and I absolutely love it. When I saw Avatar, all I saw was the same exact thing, minus the songs and plus the blue aliens. Seriously! The main character goes to an alien planet, just as John Smith went to the New World. He is at first, is like the other military people: brainless, trigger-happy, and no respect for nature and people that are different from them, just as John Smith, along with the other Jamestown settlers, enjoy the talk of shooting Indians (gasp) I mean, Native Americans. He falls in love with the daughter of the blue alien tribe, just as John Smith falls in love with the daughter of the Native American tribe. So, John Smith, I mean, the main character of Avatar, begins to fight for THEIR side, much to the military people's displeasure. Is anyone getting this? The story is an EXACT COPY of the story of Pocahontas, with a few minor (and I mean MINOR) tweaks. I was actually expecting the alien lady to start singing \"Colors of the Wind\". Obviously whoever had to write this story got extremely lazy, and decided to steal another movie's storyline, and change it a little, hoping it would cover up the whole thing, which didn't work. <br/><br/>2) The feeling of the movie- I cringed and winced and groaned in pain as this movie dragged ON and ON and ON and ON. I left the theater, tired, dizzy, and totally irritated that my poor dad spent good money on seeing this piece of trash. Anyway, this movie was not all uplifting. Every time there was an emotional (if I can even call it that) moment, I wanted to throw a rotten tomato at the screen. The acting was terrible. Want examples? Okay: The main character, with his inability to listen to people and his very flat personality. The blue alien lady he falls in love with, with her weird facial expressions, and her odd wailing when she was sad that made me cringe in disgust. Just about everyone else's performances were not memorable; it was like watching a bunch of wooden puppets walking across the screen. The pace of the movie was also terrible. It was FAR too long. Pocahontas told the story in an hour and a half. Avatar managed to drag the story out for almost THREE HOURS. Did they really think that we would sit through all that and not have any complaints? <br/><br/>3) The situations- One thing I have to say about this is that some of the scenes in this movie were questionable. Number one, when the main character and alien lady are kissing under the Spiritual Tree thing or whatever the heck it's called. It was really weird to me. For the first few seconds, it was like, \"oh, okay. They're kissing. Whatever.\" And then they dive into a full- blown make-out session that looked so awkward, I actually laughed. Number Two (SPOILER), when the main character is dying because he doesn't have one of those oxygen mask things, and the alien lady comes in at the last minute and puts it on his face and saves him. For one, he then reaches his hand up to touch her face, and for another, since he's a human and she's an alien, she's so much bigger than him, and the whole situation looks really awkward. Another thing, I saw this in several moments in this movie. One dude in the beginning said that the planet's air could kill humans in four minutes or less. At one point in the movie, the main bad guy, an army general or something, doesn't have a mask on, and he's outside! He comes back indoors, like ten minutes later, shaken, but not in bad health. He was out in the open for ten minutes on that planet! He should have been dead! And speaking of which (SPOILER), in the \"final confrontation\" between the main character, his alien love, and the bad guy, the alien lady shoots the bad guy IN THE HEART. He stumbles around for five minutes, and keeps fighting! She shoots him AGAIN, in the same spot, and he chokes and gasps for five more minutes before he FINALLY drops dead. Um... I don't know if the rules of science and human anatomy have changed, but I have always been taught that if you are shot in the heart, you die in that instant. Obviously the people who made this movie forgot that widely-known rule. Absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>4) The characters- All I have to say is that the characters were shallow, stereotypical, and absolutely boring and depressing. I didn't feel anything for them, other than the despair that after two hours, the movie STILL WASN'T OVER. <br/><br/>Hopefully by now you get my point. Special effects are not the movie. It needs MORE: a good, original story, lovable characters, believable situations, and a moderate length that tells the story, and keeps the viewers thinking and entertained. No more of this Michael Bay Syndrome that EVERYONE seems to have today. People, start getting some idea of what entertainment is. Please stop giving these people money for their laziness.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Saw this in 3D today - has my thumbs up! The 3D works (even with my vision) and the story, although predictable (I'd figured out the ending by about 20 minutes into the film) was nonetheless very enjoyable and touched me deeply in several scenes.<br/><br/>Actually, the film reminded me a lot of two SF stories: Call me Joe by Poul Anderson, and Hothouse by Brian Aldiss. Anyway, the themes are not new, but what is new is the totality of the treatment. Almost all of the action takes place in an alien environment with the Narvi - all of which is computer generated. There is live action footage and characters spliced into this as well, and it is absolutely seamless. Within 10 minutes I was immersed into the environment, and wishing it really existed!<br/><br/>With a lot of films of this ilk the plot is a bit simplistic. We don't know much about the corporation exploiting the planet, but we can guess that this is either the same one seen in the Aliens films, or one very similar in operation. Really though the situation mirrors a number of colonial and post-colonial situations in recent history, where local and indigenous populations lost out to overseas interest in their resources.<br/><br/>No doubt about who the \"bad guys\" are and this is pretty clear from the trailer. It takes time but you learn about the Narvi over the course of the film and come to understand their culture and religion - a religion that seems to be based on a \"real goddess\" as well. But it's also clear that ultimately the good guys will win, and that the main character will, well you'll see. Suffice it to say that what happens is telegraphed well before it occurs.<br/><br/>But even with its predictability, I loved this film. I shall have to see it again, without the 3D,to see if that makes a difference.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">When somebody asks me about the film I like, the first one to pop up in my head is Avatar although it isn't my favourite movie. However, it's one of the best ones I've ever seen. Avatar is a sci-fi film with a love story included. The film stars american actors Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana.\n",
       " The film is about former marine Jake Sully who travels with a team of sciencists to Pandora - moon of a planet very distant from our solar system to explore its nature and creatures Na'vi living on it. However, a certain administration that came to Pandora to mine a valuable mineral doesn't mind killing Na'vi during mining and Jake with sciencists have to stop them before it's too late.\n",
       " The acting was perfect, actors did a great job. Music was very well chosen. The film is placed in a world completely different from the one we know, so the producers had to use a lot of CGI and many special effects and they were spectacular! I was amazed by them from the first sight. The plot was very unusual. However, i still liked it. The film was completely unpredictable - i didn't know what was going to happen from the beggining to the end!\n",
       " In my opinion, this film is full of action and pretty gripping. The best thing about it are the amazing special effects. Overall, it's a really enjoyable film and I would reccomend it for everyone who likes action and adventures.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It would be lovely to be able enjoy a good movie from a used-to-be good director, but this is not the case. \"Avatar\" can only offer you somewhat interesting CGI, but no story, no characters and no way to relate to this overpriced cartoon in any way. On the positive side, I found Zoe Saldana as Neytiri to be kind of cute. What I specifically disliked: 1) There are ridiculous entities in \"Avatar\" that sound just stupid and come with no explanation, such as the name of this moon, which is 'Pandora'. Is it an indigenous name or a nickname? What's this 'Unobtanium' mineral and what does it do aside from just being potentially shiny? Are those unexplainable floating mountains made of 'Unobtanium'? In science, this term is used for describing a non-existing material with impossible qualities. 2) I do not even have to mention that \"Avatar\" feels like a bad mix of 'Star Wars', 'Dances with Wolves', 'Matrix', 'Pocahontas' and a half a dozen of other rather famous films and even video games. A number of concepts were so obviously recycled from \"Aliens\" that it was sickening to watch. There are no original ideas in \"Avatar\". 3) Why are those blue aliens act so much like people from African tribes? Them aliens should not have been from Africa, right? What is all this African and Middle Eastern music for? 4) What is the story with the animals? Why do they mostly look and act like the Earth animals. I can mention the Pandorian animal species that look to me so much like rhinos, horses, wolves, and even the ancient flying dinosaurs - the pterodactyls. Those natives just keep riding them extra-multi legged horses in a usual Earth-like way! Looks like the moon of Pandora was borrowing lots of animals from Earth. Whoever might have been doing this? 5) How come that the blue Pandorian aliens use all the familiar primitive Earth weapons? I am talking about bows and arrows, bolos and such. 6) What is the story with the English language? Its comprehension among the characters goes on and off all the time. First they do not speak any English, then they speak some broken English, then no one speaks English again and then, after months of studying the native language, the main character fellow all of a sudden needs an interpreter to speak to the crowd of locals. So, he seems to have forgotten the Pandorian language and the locals forgot every bit of English all of a sudden. 7) How come that the arrows that the natives shoot are harmless to the aircraft at first and then then work as effectively as armor-piercing munitions with depleted Uranium cores? 8) Why the whole movie has no background story? This makes all the characters even more flat and lifeless. Also, one can get sick of all this liberal anti-American and racist ideology that \"Avatar\" builds upon. Couldn't they play some other cards that are not so obvious and overused? Anyway, it is a great shame that this potentially tremendous movie turned out even worse than 'Terminator 2'. I do not regret watching \"Avatar\", though. Now, I know exactly what kind of mental abilities to expect from people who rave about it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar: beyond the bandwagon<br/><br/>A Critical Analysis.<br/><br/>I was wondering why the name Avatar first, checked Wiki and got this as an explanation, In Hinduism Avatar or Avatāra (Devanagari Sanskrit for \"descent\" viz., from heaven to earth) refers to a deliberate descent of a deity from heaven to earth, and is mostly translated into English as \"incarnation\", but more accurately as \"appearance\" or \"manifestation\". 1 In the movie however the Blue humans were considered as humans and Humans were like Gods from Above Earth. Hilarious but acceptable.<br/><br/>Then I checked Avatar on Google on its uses. The proliferation of avatar's second meaning can be traced to Second Life, a multiplayer online virtual world, where players fashion their own online personae called avatars. Yahoo! implores instant messengers to \"Express yourself with Yahoo! Avatars\" (barely customizable icons) — a synonymy of online personae has emerged.2 Now here we have James Cameroon imagination coming to reality on celluloid as Avatar. Yes most expensive film ever made, and most talked film of the decade perhaps the century. Jim became the God. However for a movie which lacks the thrill, punch lines and above all a nice story. Anyways none of the previously released movie of Cameroon has a great story. He relied more on technology and always believed in pushing its limits. And he has done a marvelous job by doing Avatar. Avatar is not an animated movie, as assumed by many. But its graphically made like 300,Harrypotter series and many so what was new here, nothing even the hype was same like before a little more glorified. The entire world crashed for Bandwagon effect. I also read some critics saying that \"Avatar\" story is too simple, one Gujarati critic Jay Vasavda wrote that the story was kept intentionally simple so that the audience can be visually mesmerized instead of getting diverted with the complexity of the story. It means that he wants to convey the message that James Cameroon is not smart enough to handle a complex story with visuals as great. Either one has to take a back seat. Poor Jim. I consider Jurassic park and Matrix for bringing cult status by technology. Avatar is just an extension with extra hype. I don't have to visit movie theatres to see technology and no story. Jim tried to put the Navis expressions in the frame but again it was too plastic and digital that it lacked passion and yielded too many yawns. A kid will surely enjoy the movie for its action and adventure. T2 was a masterpiece and so was Titanic. Avatar is obviously better than piranha's II, Abyss, and true lies. Increasing heights, changing colors and decreasing few fingers can convert a human into navis. The funny part is that you have a tail and a plug-in like tentacle. The plug like is like a male multi threaded pin plug which you can plug into horses, UFB(Un identified flying birds). To tame anything even plants all u need is to pull and plug. The glowing jungle looks mesmerizing but is kept too dark and bluish. The philosophy of transmogrification looks so insipid that you may feel a sense of easy imagination adding some extra masala off your kitchen self. Calvin's transmorgnifier box was only better to scare Hobbes, but we are not stuffed toys. The Human chief looks very ill and too inhuman in the actions. There was a clear antithetical between good and bad, Humans were not humans and the non-Humans were like Humans. Jake was the link between these two worlds, fevicoled by a bollywoodish love story. Guy meets gal in the jungle. With his childish calm and naughtiness win over her heart then fight with the world to win over gal's society. DDLJ rings the bell. Not exactly; but a bell is a bell and it may sound akin.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Do I even have to tell you how awesome this movie is? In a nutshell...<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>The visuals, the graphic, what you see on screen. James Cameron literally built his own new world, shot on it, then release the movie for us to see. That's how real it felt. And to think that I only saw it in 2-D. Imagine seeing it in 3-D if you haven't.<br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal. The reason is because the actors actually acted the whole movie before it is layered with those photo-realistic imagery. Zoe Saldana really captures the audience with how 'real' she was on screen. Her emotion, her movement and even her voice can tell you how her character is feeling.<br/><br/>The others are good too. Nothing less that can be expected from a James Cameron movie. Sam Worthington proves to us that he is the next big thing as he can play any character as he is transformed from a crippled to a warrior. And Sigourney Weaver's back!<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>Well, to be honest, the movie is not exactly original. In fact, it's also predictable. But that what makes it fun! It's the type of movie that you watch to relax and have a good time. And to think about it, this movie was written ages ago before James Cameron dusted it for filming. So technically, at the time, it was quite original.<br/><br/>Overall: You should see it. You don't need anybody to tell you to see it. If you haven't, then there's something wrong with you.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Despite being a huge admirer of James Cameron's work (particularly Aliens and Terminator 2), I was skeptical about Avatar from the beginning. I just had this feeling that Cameron's statements about how \"this movie will change the way we look at films\" would lead to a significant backlash, not to mention the basic story sounded very much like that of – and forgive me for using the \"popular complaint\" – Dances with Wolves. That being said, I just walked out of one of the best movie-going experiences I've ever had in my life.<br/><br/>If there's one area in which Cameron has assuredly pushed the envelope, it would be the visuals; an argument could seriously be made that this is – visually – the most beautiful film ever crafted. The sound and effects presented here – especially when experiencing it in IMAX – really draw you into this world of Pandora, and the motion-capture character animation is far beyond that seen in Robert Zemeckis' recent films. This is, honestly, one of those instances in which the awe-inspiring visuals are essential to the experience.<br/><br/>Even so, there still has to be a solid story in order for Avatar to be a great movie, and thankfully, Cameron delivers. While the plot of this film does indeed feel like it's taken a couple dozen pages out of Kevin Costner's award-winning western, it all fits in perfectly with this ecology – this world – that Cameron's created. The characters and the performances of them, too, are terrific. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana carry this film beautifully as Jake Sully and Neytiri, and the relationship between them, surprisingly, ended up being very touching. There are a couple of scenes in particular, actually, that had me tearing up a bit. As for the other performances, Stephen Lang – while not exactly given the best lines at points – is chilling as Colonel Miles Quaritch, and Sigourney Weaver is endearing as Dr. Grace Augustine.<br/><br/>Avatar is one hell of a movie-going experience, with – at the risk of sounding cliché – breathtaking visuals that compliment the engaging (if familiar) story rather than overshadow it, some extremely likable and believable characters, and an intense, forty-minute-long climax that would be a crime to go into detail about here. Avatar is a prime example of why we all go to films in the first place.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I am very, very disappointed with this movie. The way people talk, it was like this movie was going to change everything about movies. I guess in some ways it did, and in others it failed miserably.<br/><br/>Let me say I've been a big fan of James Cameron until his last few movies. I grew up in the 80's, and he did change film making in the 1980's. From Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, and Terminator 2. Those movies influenced many people and movies. Sadly the last three films True Lies, Titanic and Avatar have failed or maybe succeeded. I guess it depends on your point of view. What is more important to you a good story and great acting or amazing visuals/action that will blow you away, because that will blow you away. If you are looking for the latter than this is the movie for your.<br/><br/>I don't know what's wrong with Cameron, maybe it's the writers he has but I believe he wrote the story for all his movies. The early ones from Terminator to Terminator 2 all had interesting stories and characters and were able to blend it together with great visuals. So I don't know what's wrong with him, except maybe he's lost his touch.<br/><br/>Oh yes the review for the movie.<br/><br/>First of the good: Simply the visuals/action, it was absolutely amazing. The world and life he created is stunning. Do I think he will change film making with what he's done with this heck yes. The world comes alive and you feel it. Sadly that's the only thing alive in this movie and leaves me thinking what could have been.<br/><br/>Now for the bad: Story: It's absolutely terrible. It's essentially what we(The Europeans) did to the native Americans of North and South America. This story has been done many times over and much, much better. Also the anti-American/imperialism is rampant through this movie. I can understand if Cameron wanted to make some kind of statement, he just should have done a better job of it.<br/><br/>Characters: Thanks to left-wing story, the characters are cardboard cut outs and uninteresting. From the company man who only cares about the making money and nothing else. The evil colonel who thinks the indigenous population are nothing but savages and hold no value. To the stereotypical Indians(The Na'vi). I mean some on it is down right laughable. The only characters that interested me were Trudy(Michelle Rodriguez) and Grace(Sigourney Weaver), but they were stuck to the back ground.<br/><br/>So overall if you enjoy nothing but great action/visuals/special effects this movie is for you, but if you also enjoy a good story and interesting characters this movie isn't for you and will leave you disappointed.<br/><br/>It left me wondering what could have been. What if this movie had a decent story interesting characters and good directing. Than I truly believe this movie would have been one for the ages and people would be talking about decades from now.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">At the movies' end, as the credits rolled, what came to mind was, \"A privilege to watch such beauty.\" I don't know what a person who doesn't love fantasy and sci fi will bring to or take away from Cameron's masterpiece. I've loved both genre's all my life and read most major works and seen all major television and film with fantasy and sci fi themes.<br/><br/>Avatar is as good as it gets. It is stunning. Thrilling. It is not original as really nothing can be anymore. But instead, Cameron has distilled fascinating themes and recreated them through his own vision.<br/><br/>There's much reminiscent of so many things there's no point in even speaking of them. But in the end, Avatar speaks for itself directly to the viewer's heart. It is an emotional film, filled with tender nuance and exquisite visual beauty, as well as wildly-rolling excitement, violence and turmoil.<br/><br/>It packs a big punch to the synapses on a number of levels, be it racial dna memory or merely guilt at what we do to one another and then segues over to the deep, mystical longing for the Mother as the mystery of Earth and Unity and our loss of touch to her.<br/><br/>I kept wondering why it was named Avatar. That is such a wonderful invention of Cameron's.<br/><br/>Enough of that - let's get to flying on dragons. OMG it is glorious.<br/><br/>A gorgeous surprise, you will love this film unless you're dead.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron is back and he really shows, that he did not loose his \"Mojo\". Avatar is just mind blowing and the visuals are absolutely stunning. The story might not be new, but with mankind robbing and destroying the earth, unable to listen to the sound of nature, it is more actual than ever. With Pandora, Cameron created a unique new fantasy world, worth every minute watching. The CGI sets new standards in movie making and animates a breathtaking environment, magical, spiritual, threatened by the human race in its excessive and disrespectful greed for money and economic growth. Sounds familiar? Hello rain forest. Anyway: entertaining, beautiful, sad, funny, dramatic, thrilling, romantic, spiritual,....: Hollywood at its best. Cameron is the man. Thank you for Avatar! Hope it does not only entertain but will also make people think. Cause we got our own \"Pandora\" here if we don't destroy it... The 3-D added a touch of magic that Im going to miss later on BluRay... Just awesome...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It's worth mentioning that due to James Cameron's visual work on this film this film was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar at the time and on the visuals alone, it is easy to see why. There aren't enough superlatives to describe them in the context of filmmaking in 2009, they are truly fantastic.<br/><br/>However, the plot is absolutely horrible. The screenplay is instantly forgettable, and the plot is so intensely predictable you begin to wonder if spending hundreds of millions of dollars on making this film is necessary at all. What in all honesty is the point when you're guilty of making a film so overblown and overlong on characters that simply do not deserve or garner any real acclaim in contemporary cinema? James Cameron is more guilty than most of making epics that instead of captivate you for the long running time (which many films are capable of doing) you begin to wonder when the credits are going to roll.<br/><br/>Overall, a visual masterpiece let down by virtually everything else.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">When I saw Terminator 2 in 1994 I did not knew who was the director. But Terminator 2 is still my best action film. I have several of its action scenes clearly in my memory and background music during the action scenes. Like when Arnold Shots and Breaks the chain of the door and then He jumps from the high point on the below road with bike. And the sparks coming out of tires of the HD bike. The hospital scene where Arnold takes out gun from the Rose bouquet and steps over the roses. Similarly there were few more remarkable scenes. Then came Titanic and as we all know it was such a grand movie. Depicting the grandness of the Ship and touching love story all very beautifully. I felt a lot of same kind of unforgettable effects while watching Avatar. The background music in the end giving a similar kind of beat as it was in Terminator 2: The Judgment Day. The film making is not just about utilizing the latest technology and to increase the budget. Its neither about to show all of your imaginations on the Silver Screen. (Harry Potter series have also a lot of imaginations but I never admired them). Actually the film making is about how you can capture the audience whole interest as they feel themselves involved in the situation. And when finally the audience comes out of the Cinema Hall he/she can easily re-construct the whole ideas of the film and can join it all together, to generate more interest in the mind to see it even multiple times. I just want to say Long Live James Cameron. If I can have some of his brilliance in me I will think myself very much blessed and lucky.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">What is it with James Cameron's penchant for only using titles that begin with the letters 'T' and 'A'? We've already had The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2, True Lies, Titanic and now he's gone straight back to 'A' again with 'Avatar'. But then Avatar is an 'A' movie in more ways than one.<br/><br/>Watching it, one could easily assume that the seeds for Avatar were sown in Cameron's head in 1989 upon the release of Dances With Wolves. As Cameron gazed at the epic scope of the western epic, he could easily have thought: 'Now why hasn't anybody set this story in space?' Thus, the synopsis of Avatar could be summarized almost identically: a soldier - Jake Sully - sent by the military to infiltrate the alien Na'vi race, falls in love with Neytiri - a native alien girl - and proves his metal to her people by becoming a warrior just like them, before finally 'going native' and joining them in battle against the very military power who sent him on the mission in the first place. We also get similar mystical overtones about being 'one with nature'. Similarly the Na'vi tribe in this movie is quite obviously based on the plight of both the Native Americans and the Africans.<br/><br/>The familiarity of the story does not in any way detract from its entertainment value. If anything, maybe it enhances it. But Avatar is still exhilarating and exciting stuff. Visually, it's unlike anything you have ever seen before. What the movie lacks in originality, it makes up for with ideas: Avatar is simply brimming with them. Cameron's imagination is let loose on this movie in a way unseen in any of his other movies. The world of Pandora is vivid and beautiful. The animals we see have a fantastical – yet somehow feasible – quality about them. It's almost as if evolution on Pandora - rather than the filmmakers - has designed these creatures for the harsh, unforgiving terrain that they occupy.<br/><br/>Avatar and Roland Emmerich's 2012 came out within a month of each other. While both are big, epic, state of the art special effects movies, it must be pointed out that the CG work on display in Avatar is vastly superior to that on offer in 2012: at no point – unlike 2012 – does the visual effects ever betray their origins. The Na'vi aliens are as photo realistic as anything ever seen. While there could definitely be an argument made that the film makers could have settled for a better design than the one they eventually went with, it's a testament to the realistic motion capture that you quickly accept them as living beings and don't question their realism. Anyone unfamiliar with the movie could easily assume they are all actors wearing make-up appliances – it's that good. And you know the filmmakers did a competent job when you actually believe that the Jake Sully character could actually fall in love with the strangely beguiling and attractive alien, Neytiri.<br/><br/>It's undeniably an auteur's work from start to finish. Cameron's stamp is all over every frame. He even borrows liberally from his own back catalog, reusing the S.Q.U.I.D. technology concept from Strange Days (which he wrote) in a similar vein in that Jake Sully is 'plugged in' and experiencing life inside another being. Though Cameron must have surely pulled his hair out when he saw a similar conceit used in The Matrix in 1999 (Avatar was written in the early to mid 90s). We even see bipedal armored 'suits' worn by their human pilots, which are not too dissimilar to the Power Loader worn by Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (and who's also present in Avatar). Coincidentally a similar version of these machines can also be seen in the third Matrix sequel, The Matrix Revolutions! <br/><br/>Sound-wise, the movie is just as astounding as it is visually, though it has to be said it seemed the sound designer 'borrowed' a few effects from the sound library created for Jurassic Park: one of the creatures makes a coughing/barking noise not too unlike the Velociraptor in the scene where the two kids are being stalked in the kitchen. On another occasion, a creature lets out a roar like that of the T-Rex during the attack on the two tour vehicles in the same movie. But these are just observations on what has to be one of the loudest mixes ever heard.<br/><br/>Anyone who's expecting a barrage of objects to be hurled continuously at the screen will be sorely disappointed. Cameron's use of the 3D process is, for the most part, very subtle. And this is precisely what reveals the double-edged sword 3D really is: if you're not going to have 'stuff coming at ya' in 3D, then you'd have to ask yourself does it really need to be 3D to begin with? Furthermore, if stuff is flying off the screen at regular intervals, then it turns what should be entertainment derived from the drama of a movie into 'a waiting for the next object to be thrown' experience. Maybe that's why 3D is more suited to horror movies. Cameron obviously knows this and is so keen to avoid the 'gimmick' tag he avoids the temptation to hurl stuff at us.<br/><br/>It could be argued that Avatar is both a sales pitch and a 'proof-of-concept' demonstration on the merits of 3D by Cameron to the general movie going audience. Perhaps the simplified nature of the story even adds credence to this notion. But he is undeniably sincere in his efforts. It's clear he believes so thoroughly in the 3D approach that he admirably avoids giving us a bloated and pretentious Star Wars Episode 1 rerun and settles for a straightforward adventure story instead. Avatar is superior even to his own Titanic. Only James Cameron could up the levels of cinematic spectacle in such a bombastic way.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This film is poor because it just tries to repeat the foundations of storytelling yet without imagination: The characters are superficial (you don't know much about anyone except the hero) The bad guys are bad The good guys are good... and weak, so you suffer for them The camera angles and script do not introduce any innovation whatsoever The story is, as many already described, Pocahontas Dansing with the Wolves in a Never Ending Story.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the richness of texture and diversity of life in the planet I waited for the end, which was sadly just as poor as the general concept<br/><br/>While enjoying the beginning and path of the hero's initiation, I then tried watching the whole movie again, yet never coming to get to the end.<br/><br/>Very cliché, very stylish. Enjoy all you can</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Over-simplistic plot, over-cliched soundtrack, over-biased character traits, over-copied storyline. Enjoyable first 45 minutes, ruined by the last 45. A blockbuster that tried to tackle the subject of respect and patrimony, without respecting the patrimony of cinematography. What an irony.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is a science fantasy for the ages, an instant cult-classic that is endearingly beautiful in nearly any way you look at it. It visually raised the bar far, far beyond anything cinema had done prior, introducing the world's audiences to an era of virtual cinematography unparalleled to any other motion-picture period, bar none.<br/><br/>Avatar is a philosophical film that explores the timeless notion of a higher power, and our position as the 'dominant' species. The planet of visitation known only as 'Pandora' parallels our world in many ways, the film grips the viewer and asks, \"who's really the alien? Who's really the outsider?\" it shows man as an accursed being to any place he might dare to dwell; 'Pandora's box' reflecting the human temptation of the knowledge of life and death in the world, as stated in the Bible. Illustrating the clash between low consciousness (invasion force) and high consciousness (na'vi).<br/><br/>The plot line is simplistic, yet manages to be exemplary. It demonstrates man's often uncanny detachment from the world around him, and predisposition to subduing the earth and making it an extension of his ego, as opposed to something to harmonise with, the saying \"wealth but at what cost?\" comes to mind.<br/><br/>The plot line follows a paraplegic marine, (Sam Worthington) who is forced to fight between this notion of harmony, and the notion of fractal greed, it turns out that his physical inhibition (paraplegia) is surpassed by joining the 'higher' consciousness through leaving his body, perhaps alluding to how spiritualism is our escape from the prison of flesh we inhabit.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">2009 has been a year of soulless special effects films- Transformers 2, and GI Joe come to mind in particular. Military-centric and lacking in anything resembling a real character, it depressed me to find such emotionally cold film-making was making so much money.James Cameron is the remedy.<br/><br/>As a director, he has often very successfully managed to balance intriguing and exciting film premises with human elements that made you care for characters- he has an amazing way of making you invest in the people he created.<br/><br/>But Avatar, for me, represents a more mature James Cameron. In Aliens and True Lies Cameron, much like the Michael Bays of today, had a boyish fascination with weaponry and the technology of war. Now James Cameron, the man, expresses his disgust at these objects. This is NOT a worship of firepower- it is a damning indictment of it.<br/><br/>Avatar has a story that acts as analogy for many things- colonialism, America's supposed war on terror, labelling Palestine's resistance fighters as terrorists, the human desire for profit vs the human need for environmental preservation. It is very much a product of our time, and it is hugely passionate in its execution. In my mind Avatar represents Cameron's rage.<br/><br/>More that this, when we hear the horrified and angry screams of an invaded population, we hear our own frustration. The film had me in tears at some points, because of the clarity and resonance of its message.<br/><br/>The film is not all doom and gloom- it is inspiring also. It demonstrates there exist universal principles that transcend race or allegiance of country, it celebrates spirituality, and abhors the arrogance of men and their guns. There were moments when the film gave me goosebumps.<br/><br/>Please see this film if it feels like the world around you doesn't always show the humanity you feel it should, if you don't understand why people's lives are so expendable in the pursuit of oil, land or empty victory. It is a strangely validating experience to find so many of your feelings so poetically reflected. Thank you Mr Cameron.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I wanted to see this in 3D as it was intended, but unfortunately the people I was going with just wanted to see it in 2D. Not all was lost, however, as the screen I saw it on was a large 70 X 30' screen. It had golden curtains that were pulled back prior to the movie starting, and the manager who introduced the film beforehand boasted that this was the largest screen in Arizona. I'm not entirely sure if that's true, what with there being IMAX's in the area and all, but I'll admit it was an impressive auditorium. <br/><br/>Several trailers played beforehand. The first was a great looking action comedy starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz called Knight and Day. Bad title, but it's now my second most anticipated movie of 2010, behind The Expendables. There were also trailers for Clash of the Titans, Salt, and one or two others I can't recall. <br/><br/>Alright, now for the actual movie. I was extremely impressed. And since I only saw it in 2D, I didn't even see the biggest part of what makes this film so special. That will change next week when I see it in IMAX 3D, but for now it's a tribute to the film's story, a rousing and compelling tale that doesn't rely on gimmicky 3D, only adds it as a bonus. <br/><br/>We all have an idea of the story by now, and some call it unoriginal, clichéd, etc. Being a remake of Infernal Affairs, you could say the same of The Departed, but like Ebert pointed out in his review of it, \"a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it.\" This certainly applies to Avatar as well; it might be a retread of familiar stories like FernGully and Dances with Wolves, but it's just told - and shown - so well that it doesn't matter in the slightest. <br/><br/>Credit to the actors for making the story as good as it is. Sam Worthington is solid, as are Sigourney Weaver and Giovanni Ribisi, but the two people who really steal the show are Stephen Lang and Zoe Saldana. Lang is the perfect antagonist for the movie, a real evil hardass we love to hate. And Saldana... You'll remember her as Uhura from Star Trek. She plays Neytiri, the Na'vi female interest Worthington falls for as he comes to know the alien race. Saldana plays her as strong and fierce, but full of emotion as well. We can thank her for a lot of the emotional heavy lifting in Avatar - tragic events wouldn't be what they are without her gut wrenching reactions. <br/><br/>I'm unable to comment on the 3D, but the other effects were terrific. I had considered Terminator 3 to be the benchmark for CGI up until about 2007, at which point Transformers set the bar, but now it's Avatar. Pandora is photorealistic, plain and simple. I'd hesitate to say the same for the Na'vi, but they're close. To be fair, we've seen effects this good before, but what sets Avatar apart is the sheer magnitude of it all - we've seen great CGI but never to this extent. Cameron also makes effective use of motion capture, the same technology Peter Jackson used for Gollum in the LOTR trilogy and King Kong. I couldn't tell if he ever used models, but that's to the credit of the movie. After all, Cameron's goal was for us to be unable to differentiate between what was real and what wasn't. And he succeeds. <br/><br/>All in all, Avatar is a rousing, exciting, action/adventure epic, and I can't wait to see it again in IMAX 3D. This is the best movie of 2009. <br/><br/>9.5/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">My review on this film is purely based on watching the IMAX 3-D screening. If you are planning on watching \"Avatar\", spend the extra money and watch it in IMAX 3-D! The regular format would be a waste of the pure creative efforts that was dedicated to this film.<br/><br/>Even though the story is unoriginal, the dialogs are flat, and the premise is cliché; the visuals and special effects are absolutely stunning! The imagination to create the colorful extraterrestrial jungle is amazing and the action sequences are incredible. Raising the bar on special effects &amp; action sequences are what James Cameron does best. He dazzled movie goers with \"Aliens (1986)\", then \"The Abyss (1989)\", then \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)\", and then \"Titanic (1997)\". \"Avatar\" cost nearly $300 million to make and like all James Cameron films, you can see every single penny that was spent on this film. The movie had the best 3-D effects than any other films that I've ever seen. It was very rare that anything ever jumped out at you, but the 3-demensional look throughout the entire movie was extraordinary.<br/><br/>As for the story, it was a generic tale where the main character's mission is to assimilate with a foreign civilization with an intended agenda; but he falls in love with a native and begins to appreciate their culture that he becomes torn between their society and his own. It's like a futuristic version of \"Dances with Wolves\" where the Na'vi culture and language are similar to Native Americans; including a lot of current political metaphors that are tied in with messages that are portrayed in the film. Even the final battle scene is very similar to the Battle of Endor in \"Return of the Jedi\". The dialogs are just as bland as James Cameron's previous film \"Titanic\", but watching the creative world that he produced with the images of the special effects &amp; action sequences are the types of experiences that all movie goers are hoping for when they are expecting to see a highly action packed movie where the visuals will astound them.<br/><br/>I have to stress that if you decide to watch this film in a regular format or wait till home video, you will NOT be able to fully appreciate or enjoy the spectacular experience of watching this film the way it was intended for us. I wish the story was better &amp; more original, but I really enjoyed the refreshing movie experience that I always get whenever I watch a highly over-budget film by James Cameron. I can always rely on him for putting the extra effort into dazzling us with his creative &amp; imaginative action sequences.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Returning to the beginning of the movie, the viewers were amazed, moved by the viewers, made the viewers happy, and made the viewers cry. \"Avatar\" tells you: let the movie dream for you !</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Although \"Avatar\" may not be James Cameron's greatest story I consider it a great popcorn movie. It is a film, that should work fine even without IMAX cinema - however with 3D for me it was fantastic! Already once Cameron took a lot of risk with \"Titanic\". Back then his success was nothing you could have expected back then! His newest creation is no less risky but it seems it will work out perfectly fine.<br/><br/>What has always impressed me considering this director and writer (especially when thinking of his movies \"The Abyss\", \"Terminator 2\", \"Aliens\"...): nothing in Camerons script seems to be coincidence. Everything seems to have a profound reason. Every picture is thoroughly thought. Same holds true for \"Avatar\". Its plot provides several typical Cameron elements: the clash of different worlds, technology versus nature, progress versus tradition, human species crossing a crucial line and so on. I heard it reminded several viewers of films like \"The Last Samurai\" but I'd say the meaning of this story goes deeper. It's not just about how we deal with other cultures and traditions, it's about how blind we deal with nature.<br/><br/>During this picture, you can almost feel how its 3D technology is evolving. The director and his crew were painting an image of colossal size, merging tons of impressive ideas from all directions (movies, nature...). So far I have never seen anything as detailed. It's like seeing (feeling in some way) a different world - which from my point of view is \"Avatar\"'s greatest strength. This time the very archetypal plot is no more than a fancy (though not less moving) accessory.<br/><br/>Easy to see I'm very positive about this movie. On the other hand - without 3D and especially on a TV screen - I could imagine that \"Avatar\" might have some lengthy moments. I assume that probably 3D needs more \"lengthy\" moments to relax than 2D. In my point of view Cameron chose the right pace and you'll have enough time to become familiar with this new world. There are several moments, when \"Avatar\" is like a \"prototype\", where not everything is perfect. And yes, the quality of 3D varies and some images seem to have little space, whereas others look totally overwhelming. But from my point of view the story is strong enough overcome little flaws.<br/><br/>Summing up: \"Avatar\" is offering a truly wonderful impression of what is possible, how cinema can/will be plus even more and also a very moving story which hopefully will create a more positive spirit towards nature. A film which already is one important brick in the wall of film history !</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the most well-done CGI hand in hand with the most disappointed movie of the year - yes, put your hands together for Avatar.<br/><br/>No, no - don't get me wrong. The movie's not bad. But the script is horribly weak! I don't know if this has anything to do with the fact that I was watching a dubbed version, but the dialogues were disappointing enough. Cameron has come up with the most convincing CGI production, but, I wonder why, he only relies on the CGI? Why didn't he work more on the story and, specially the script? The direction is very slow at times, and tends to get irritating. The predictability of the movie is the worst part. We're tired of the some-stroke-of-luck last- minute-life-saving moments of the lead roles. Let them DIE man!<br/><br/>Go watch Avatar for the deliciously sweet eye-candy, but if you're hoping for something big, then you might as well skip it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I went to see this movie expecting to watch maybe the greatest sci-fi movie made, but I will, never again in my life, expect that a movie will be great only because its visual effects.<br/><br/>People are saying that even with a mediocre script and so full of clichés (sometimes I figured out the next lines, it's just depressing), it's a visual wonder and a revolution to cinema, if this is the revolution, I don't want to watch new movies anymore. From 1900 to 1950 they made some of the best movies ever made, and their special effects (When they had it) were laughable.<br/><br/>I hated almost every character of it. There is the bad Colonel, the greedy \"businessman\", the doctor that want to protect the animals and their cultures, Come on, what is this? a fairy tale?. They spent 250 million dollars making a movie (A bad one), and in the end they say, \"Protect the green!\", \"In my world there is no green! Man destroyed it!\", don't you think that is kind of controversial?. Giant blue people attack everybody they see in their way, and you want to protect them? <br/><br/>Now let's talk about the special effects, of course they are great, but I think it is stupid to make this very tall blue people without never making them interact with a human, or put a human in their environment. There was a moment in the movie that I actually laughed, the fight between Jake's avatar and Quaritch's giant robot, I mean, It's a giant robot full of gun's and all that stuff, and It carries a giant knife... hahahahahaha, that is so Looney Tunes.<br/><br/>Verdict: Again, Visual effects only, don't make a good movie.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">If only this movie had a better story to tell. Avatar by James Cameron is a visually stunning film with some really great CGI, and the world of Pandora is engrossing but the story is so pedestrian that it makes it difficult to watch the movie 2 plus hours.<br/><br/>The basic story is one of a disabled veteran Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) who takes over his brothers role of a Nivi (the indigenous inhabitants of Pandora). Colonel Miles Quaritch(Stephen Lang) uses Jake as a spy to gather information about the Nivi. Well Jake is found by Neytiri(Zoe Saldana) and she will become his teacher in the way of the Nivi and they also fall in love, Jake goes native and it becomes the colonel's task to destroy the Nivi to help some greedy earth corporation. <br/><br/>The problem is that besides Jake and Neytiri all the other characters are sock one dimensional cartoon types particularly the evil corporate manager and the colonel. The story is rehash of several others and the environmental message is played way to much with a heavy hand. Am I the only one but the floating mountains seem to be a rip off of Roger Deans album covers from the 70's I thought I was looking at my old vinyl copy of Yes Songs. I was expecting to hear Close to the Edge at any moment.<br/><br/>Grade C+</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">And I thought \"Shock and Awe\" was a tactic used only in war! I'm amazed James Cameron is not doing MTV music videos, because that's exactly how Avatar plays out: a massive, carefully crafted, thunderous gargantuan tower of nothing. I really can't explain this film: I actually enjoy a film when its goal is pure and simple entertainment. I don't expect everything to be a revolutionary Godardesque \"work of art\": if a film is cliché, but enjoyable, then fine. But this thing isn't enjoyable at all: it's overlong, tiresome, cumbersome, heavy-handed, filled with attention to detail but also filled with contempt for the overall picture. There's nothing catchy, nothing endearing going on: it's just ham-fisted down your throat for more than two hours and a half. In terms of James Cameron, this is closer to Titanic than to Terminator II.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's okay for a film to be long, heavy and unforgiving... provided it has something INTERESTING to say. Avatar has nothing: everything here has been done before, and better. Everything! Every little piece of the film, especially the plot, is recycled. So he created a whole new world? Who cares? Many have done that before! Go back to Tolkien if you want a classic example! There's nothing here worth to be seen, and if you want to have an \"amazing\" cinematic experience, it's better to see 10 films which are excellent on their own ground, rather than a single film that claims to be everything but falls short in every aspect -- except for the \"Shock and Awe\", of course.<br/><br/>3D? I'm glad I didn't see that in 3D; I'd rather leave it to more lighthearted, actually fun films, not this overblown pile of misery.</div>,\n",

       " Yeah, it's 2019 which puts me nearly 10 years later since it's release, but Avatar is something I've never seen before. For a movie that's so heavily based on CGI, nothing felt wrong. They created a world and creatures that fit and with such unique designs. The story was deep in it's simplicity but there was so much complexity all around just waiting for a chance to see the light.\n",
       " I can hardly wait for the sequel.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It is 11 years since James Cameron brought AVATAR to cinema screens, where it proved to be one of the most stunning releases (and most successful) Films of all time. So why have I chosen to write a Review of it now? Well, a belated Sequel will arrive next year and in the decade or so since this Film's release it seems the message of the Filmmaker appears to have been largely ignored by the very people who needed to understand it!\n",
       " The premise is simple - Mankind have now colonised a new world - 'Pandora' - a largely unspoilt and staggeringly beautiful world in which mankind have a small base. Also living on Pandora are the indigenous people (the na'vi') and a plethora of wildlife. Unfortunately, the Human presence is a 'Commercial' enterprise with a large Military capability that sees Pandora as nothing more than yet another place to exploit for rare minerals and therefore expendable.\n",
       " A Scientific Programme has been set up in the hope of 'persuading' the Na'vi to let the human contingent mine where they want by moving out of the way. The Programme uses 'Avatars' - humans that are transported into 'na'vi bodies - to help them study and convert the locals. Enter Jake Sully, a young ex-marine in a wheelchair, whose twin Brother was on the Programme until murdered. Initially meeting scepticism and derision from the other Scientists, Sully slowly begins to realise what is really at stake on Pandora - and that he will have to make a momentous decision - who or what - to fight for?\n",
       " The Film astounded audiences back in 2009 as it's Special Effects were SO far ahead of anything else. Even 11 years later they are still spectacular (and in my opinion superior to most recent Sci-Fi releases). The Pandorian world and ecosystem is designed and shown in HUGE depth, Scientifically thought out and spectacularly brought to life on the screen. But this is not just a gorgeous cinematic eye-fest - the motion Capture of the na'vi actors ensures that they are brought to life in a graceful and realistic manner. This is vital for the Film's central Drama - when WE begin to destroy environments that do not belong to us, who do we decide is right - or wrong? James Cameron has always loved 'hard wear' - and it is in AVATAR in abundance - the Humans are the ones in metal, plastic and armed to the teeth. The na'vi are in absolute harmony with their ecosystem and world - all of their culture is naturalistic - textiles, wood and other plant materials. They even ride some of the creatures symbiotically- especially the flying 'Dragons'. Even their religious and sacred beliefs are totally bound to the ecology.\n",
       " All of this shows that Cameron is making a statement - we as the audience KNOW we should want the Humans in the Film to be noble, moral and empathetic - but they mostly come across as anything but. The na'vi are the ones that evoke our reaction - they are courageous, noble, sincere and generous. It is not long before the na'vi are forced to battle for their own world, with the Scientific Team and Jake Sully forced to choose a side.\n",
       " Of course, this is a direct mirror of what we have done to our own planet - Global Warming, Climate Change, destruction of rainforest, ruthless pillaging of natural resources and dumping of waste and pollution. There were many people who didn't like the message that Cameron and AVATAR presented and I have read some of the reviews here .\n",
       " This Film is a landmark of Science Fiction - a genre that has consistently been ignored by 'serious' Film Critics. Yet, AVATAR's message was - and remains - a very serious one. We destroy the natural world at our peril and, in the decade since it's original release, this message is even MORE relevant now.\n",
       " The Film was recently surpassed by 'Avengers: Endgame' as the top-grosser BUT AVATAR remains the FAR superior Film. James Cameron's passion for this project - and the issues it highlights - are there on the screen for audiences to see. Even a decade later this remains a glorious landmark for the Genre - and a timely warning for us all of what we could lose...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Open your eyes, and see into the world of Pandora. What you will find is the most magical place you could ever hope to see. Perhaps at one time Earth was not so different.<br/><br/>I will admit this movie could feel a little on the slow side. But it will not feel that way if you really get what Jake is going through. You have to take in everything that you see.<br/><br/>To criticize this movie for being too powerful in the visuals is like criticizing a pizza for having good cheese on it. So what if the movie was done on a computer. That does not change the fact that they put years of work into it, which is more than we can say for New Moon, a movie that was done in such a lazy fashion that Kristin Stewart's hair was not even real.<br/><br/>Do not dismiss this movie. It is one of the greatest films ever made.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The story of Avatar is by no means original. Avatar is simply the story of Dances with Wolves retold in outer space. This raises the question: is it really necessary to retell this story in outer space? Well this change in setting does not make it impossible to enjoy this film it does make it so silly that it should not be taken seriously. I for one do not take the premise that a species so incredibly advanced that they are capable of interstellar travel would act this way seriously for even a second. Nor do I take the idea that they would happen to encounter a planet where the native inhabitants are are sexually attractive to them and perfectly in tune with nature like the Na'vi are seriously nor should anyone for that matter.<br/><br/>So the whole premise of this movie is silly but what is worse is that it is incredibly manipulative as well. The whole story is set up in order to manipulate you into accepting its message. And that message is that the Na'vi are good and the military is bad. In order to coax you into accepting this message the military is led by a comical stereotype whose only motivation is to acquire a make believe element called Unobtainium with completely unexplained properties. As a result you do not have to decide for yourself which side you want to root for because the producers of this film have already made this decision for you. Well it is still possible to enjoy this film despite all its flaws it should not be taken too seriously in the process.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I am still in awe. This film has surpassed the visual barriers. It is the marking the beginning of a new era in film. Why do I say that? Because it's done by James Cameron and after-all, he has surpassed technological barriers before with the release of Terminator 2 and Titanic in the 90's.<br/><br/>This movie has been in the making for over 15 years and it looks like it has paid off. James wanted to wait till technology got better, then he got his inspiration from Lord of the Rings. He took that inspiration and he perfected so that NO ONE will ever make a movie this good for a very long time, visually. He created the camera, the graphics, basically he created new technology and this opens SO MANY windows of opportunities for other film-makers in Hollywood. The next decade of sci-fi, or special effects driven films will look like Avatar thanks to James Camerons' technology.<br/><br/>Now to the story. This is such a beautiful tale of a man with a disability who befriends a different species outside of our solar system and respects their way of life. Now a lot of people compare this movie with \"Dances With Wolves\" but I have never seen that movie so I can't say anything and it seems that people love comparing films nowadays to feel like they deserve to have an opinion. Anyway, on with the story. After our main hero befriends the Na'vi populace, he has a change of heart and sides with them, the militia that has populated Pandora doesn't like this, they just want their materials and will kill anything in their path to have it.<br/><br/>The Na'vi are not a violent species unless they are pushed over the edge. The humans who inhabit the planet only want raw materials that sell for 20 million a kilo. A lot of other parasites have said that it makes fun of Americans and their way of life, of how they seek nothing else but to dominate everything in its path. I mean, isn't that true? They love doing that, and they have been doing that for the last 200 years. But this movie is not about that egotistical, and arrogant country, it's about the human species when it comes into contact with another species; we hunt them down if they don't co-operate or if they we think they're a nuisance, and on top of that, claim their land as ours. It's true though, we would do that if we wanted to colonize on another planet with another species. We would kill them. No wonder aliens don't visit us, we're f***ed up.<br/><br/>Anyways, I can't stress it more that you MUST see this movie. It's one of those movies you should see before you die. Even if it's your last day before you die because you have a critical disease or condition; you have to see this film. It will make your life and your death so worthwhile. You will die in awe. Definitely a blu-ray purchase in my books. 10/10 for a visual evolution, a breathtaking story and an outstanding experience in IMAX 3D..the way it was meant to be seen.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">First of all, I would like to point out that I didn't walk into the theater with high expectations. I had heard that the story was laughably bad and unoriginal, but that the visuals were mindblowing: that's why I went. Sadly, Avatar failed to impress me even with flashy CGI. Let me tell you why:<br/><br/>Well, yeah: the story WAS really bad. But I guess everybody knows that now, so I won't waste more time on that. Let's start with the acting: all bar one (Giovanni Ribisi) were awful. Sam Worthington changes accents every 12 seconds, switching at will between American, Australian, New Zealand and something totally undefinable (which sort of sounds like German English). Zoe Saldana cries like a monkey with a mental illness, Sigourney Weaver brings her lines as if she can't wait to be somewhere else, And the general might have the looks, but lacks any real conviction in all he says. Let's continue with characters: except for Zoe's and Sam's roles, none of the people in the movie are fleshed out to the point that you actually give a damn about them. Also, all the auxiliary characters have SO little screen time that you don't even have time to care. On to the FX: I'm really trying to figure out what was so spectacular about them. Detailed? Yes. Sharp? Very. Fluid? Absolutely. Gorgeous? Freakin' A. Realistic? Not at all. I felt like I was watching a video game played on a next-next-next-gen console. I never felt like anything was real, which totally took me out of the movie. District 9 for example gave me the idea that no CGI was used, and they did that on a 13th of the budget Avatar had. Continuing with the duration of the movie: I really don't mind long movies. The Green Mile happens to be one of my favorite films of all time. But when I walk out of the theater after three hours and feel like the whole movie could be trimmed down to one and a half without detriment to the story, I get the sensation that I have been cheated. Finally, my thoughts on 3D: for one, my eyes hurt like hell after the film was over. Also, I don't feel like they utilized it to its maximum capacity; My Bloody Valentine, a horrible, horrible movie, at least had axes flying at you. In Avatar most of the 3D is taking place on the sides of the screen, which only gave me headaches while trying to focus on these elements.<br/><br/>So, how about some praise? Here goes: I thought the design of the creatures and the landscapes was incredible. I didn't like the execution, but the look of the animals and plants was quite original. Also, I respect the amount of work put into this movie. I thought it was horrible, but I have to admit it was an amazing feat of computer programming.<br/><br/>My two cents.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">First, a couple caveats: I did not see this in the theater, and I did not see this in 3-D.<br/><br/>That said, even in small screen format and even without 3-D, this is a visually impressive movie. It creates a world that looks believable and there is nothing that jars you when the movie transitions from obvious real photography with real sets and real people, to obvious animation with everything on the screen computer-generated. Considering the scope of this movie, that's very impressive.<br/><br/>Before going any further, I want to comment on some of the influences I saw in this movie. I haven't read anything about James Cameron's creative process in writing the movie, and I don't know what books he's read or movies he saw that influenced \"Avatar.\" But this movie had elements that I saw that reminded me very strongly of Anne McCaffrey's \"Dragonriders of Pern\" saga, as well as some of Robert Heinlein's works-- most notably \"Starship Troopers.\" And visually, it really reminded me very strongly of Joss Whedon's \"Titan A.E.\" animated movie in some of its appearance.<br/><br/>I don't know if these things went into the mix when Cameron made the movie. But the movie reminded me of them, and I think other people will see some of the resemblances. Whatever.<br/><br/>Once you get past the visual candy, the movie is fairly straightforward in its plot. We have a technologically superior culture moving in on a naturalistic aboriginal culture. The techies have found deposits of a super-valuable mineral on the planet, and they want to mine the minerals. The techie faction is represented by the corporate evil-doers, the profit motive, assisted by the military faction, which does the security and pushes the techie agenda without questioning the morality or ethics. Attached to the techies as a sort of concession to the sentient-being rights people is a unit headed by an anthropologist (Sigourney Weaver) who utilizes a consciousness-transfer technology to drop humans into the bodies (Avatars) of indigenous people (the Na'vi), ostensibly to study the natives and try to negotiate with them.<br/><br/>One of the humans used in the Avatar program is Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a Marine who is a recent paraplegic and is a last-minute addition to the Avatar program after his twin brother is inconveniently killed. Through a series of fortuitous events, Sully is taken in by a Na'vi Clan, which undertakes to train him and initiate him into their culture.<br/><br/>From this point, the movie is predictable: the Na'vi have a culture with reverence for the environment and seeks a balance with nature, rather than a submission of nature. Sully slowly falls in love with both the culture and with a woman of the Na'vi people, Neytiri, who is his guide through initiation into their culture. Initially committed to the assistance of the goals and means of the Marines who forward the human techie agenda, he changes his viewpoint. He \"goes native.\" This brings us to the inevitable climax, the battle of good vs. evil and technology vs. nature. The good guys win, at least this round of the battle, although it's a given that the human interests aren't going to let well enough alone. There HAS to be a sequel, don't you think? And that's my primary gripe with this movie. Leaving aside the way it breaks new ground on 3-D technology and the quality of the animation, it's a formulaic story: Ewoks vs. Storm Troopers, Indians vs. Evil Land-Stealing Settlers, Aztecs vs. Conquistadores. The techies and their military enforcers are bad, they refer to the locals as \"monkeys\" and other derogatory terms, and just want to rape the land and make money money money. And the indigenous peoples are gentle, have a strong religious culture that venerates nature and the land, and they do fun things like ride dragons and weird horse-like creatures. They eat meat, but when they kill anything, they say a benediction over the kill to release the soul. And they wear loincloths and the females cover their breasts so we don't get into any issues of nudity. What fun.<br/><br/>In the end, I think your feelings about this movie are going to depend on how much you like being pounded over the head with a sledgehammer to get the message that technology/capitalism are bad, respect for nature/living close to the land are good. While the movie does a fabulous job of giving you a whole new world to escape into, and that's wonderful, it doesn't capitalize on this by giving you a story that's original and a viewpoint that's nuanced or complex. And that is, in my opinion, a serious flaw.<br/><br/>Maybe Cameron is really representing how he feels, but it would be nice if he would trust his audience to be able to deal with complexities and contradictions and subtleties, rather than reducing everything to a nature-good, technology-bad morality play. Maybe in the sequel? Somehow, I doubt it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This movie 'avatar' is possibly the best selling movie of all time.<br/><br/>the plot is brilliant and it is well written but it was a disappointment.<br/><br/>i thought it was just TERRIBLE the CGI is amazing but it is just not for me i guess. lots of people were telling me to watch it and after months of holding it off i decided to give it a go.but i just don't understand why so many people like this......<br/><br/>I also feel that the movie dragged on a bit too long 'james cameron' was brilliant in making the classic titanic which is much better but i feel he has lost his touch since then <br/><br/>it is a sci-fi Adventure type movie so if you like those kind of movies then go for it but if not then stay away from 'Avatar'.<br/><br/>if you are a fan of james cameron the get a look at 'sanctum'</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Sure, it seems very realistic. Sure, a expensive film with cool helicopters, and research in inventing a whole planet with life forms. But when you play god, you cannot win. I don't know how many people described these alien designs as \"Creative\", but it's obvious that they are all blue elves with lizard tails. I actually paid $120 (15 USD) to see blue native elves with lizard tails managing to defeat technology using nothing more than spears and arrows. Got that? This is just another liberal film, and I can see how it sucks. It is simply impossible for blue elves using spears and arrows to defeat human technology. And a person sent to talk with the aliens, yet not achieving his duty and rebelling against his own kind does make me feel good. how on earth would anyone want to see his/her own race get slaughtered like that? Oh, wait, it's on a small moon. And many seemed to enjoy the fact that this film did not take advantage of 3D technology and make any \"roller coaster scenes\". I don't. 3D films exist for thrill. I don't see why only horror films and Pixar can make 3D films with thrilling moments. Anyway, see it for the technology. remember to bring ear plugs.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar certainly succeeds in being entertaining, but theirs precious little more here than being well-made 'escapist' fare. While the visual effects are absolutely fantastic, the film lacks an innovative story. From the beginning to end, Avatar is a predictable fare that only sustains on the back of its spectacle. Even encouraging performances by Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana can't cover the films cringe-worthy dialogue, one-dimensional characters, and safe, clichéd narrative. So while Cameron spent 10 years waiting for technology to improve, and an additional 5 years developing Avatar's effects, what the hell happened to the script? He should have realized that the visual splendor of Pandora could only hide Avatar's lack of heart so long.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar isn't really a live action movie. It is a computer generated cartoon. The story is Dances With Wolves on another planet. It has the subtitles, Indians, and evil evil Americans coming to take away everyone's land. It is an exact copy! Anyway, this movie gets laughable in it's Al Gore liberalism. The bad humans come from a \"dead\" planet where it is no longer \"green.\" All because the evil corporation wants the mineral UNOBTAINIUM. The name is so stupid I have to mention it again. Unobtainium...HAHAHAHAHAHA! I thought I had not heard the name right the first time that reject actor who played the corporation guy said it. Who in their right mind would use such a stupid name? Unobtainium??????<br/><br/>The bad, evil Marine in charge wears muscle shirts, which is very professional. And I couldn't believe my eyes when the evil Marine in his Matrix 3-Aliens 2 walking robot pulls out a novelty-sized RAMBO KNIFE! Is this the height of technology in the future? A giant comedy Rambo knife? In the future they also allow cigarettes in liberal corporate high tech labs and they let a paralyzed person sleep in transport for 5 years when they can fix spines and have human controlled robots that use massive Rambo knives.<br/><br/>The stupidest part of this movie is when the good Marine decides to organize the blue cartoon people to fight the huge, modern evil army. Does this make any sense at all? There was no possible way they could win, so he sent them all into battle knowing they couldn't win with flying dinosaurs and wooden arrows. Then the animals, needing to stay \"GREEN\" and save themselves from the evil corporation, somehow organize and fight off the bad guys. So, boring and charisma-free Terminator Salvation guy who's Australian accent comes and goes caused many blue cartoon people to die FOR NO REASON! Their fighting didn't do anything! James Cameron is one of the most hyped directors ever. His movies, with the exception of the first Terminator, all SUCK. He ruined Aliens. The original is a classic but his attempt to copy the realistic dialogue and style of the first was terrible, and he can't stay away from the evil corporation as the bad guy. The Abyss was also very, very stupid and Titanic is one of the worst movies ever made. I could go on as to why his movies suck but there's just too much to list.<br/><br/>Avatar is a disaster. But don't avoid seeing it. Watch it and laugh.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I remember watching 'Avatar' in cinema. It was a beautiful experience to watch, but way too long in running time and predictable in storyline after only 5 minutes.<br/><br/>James Cameron's ongoing same storyline of human industrialism pushing the buttons and finally costing our heads is always present in his movies. Wheter it is about fictional human inventions like a Terminator, exploring space and bumping into a bunch of predator aliens (I know he made a sequel to a movie he wasn't involved with, but still...), the forces of nature in 'Titanic' and so on, Cameron didn't even try to come up with an original storyline in this one.<br/><br/>Instead, the story weighs heavily on beaten paths, predictable story lines and stereotype characters in a movie that could have been so much more.<br/><br/>I cannot bear watching it anymore. Maybe for about 45 minutes and then I'm bored to death, even slightly irritated.<br/><br/>It's a shame, because it is such a beautiful experience for our ocular organs.<br/><br/>It's a pity. A lost chance.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">My family and I were completely blown away by this film - more, rather, a film EXPERIENCE like no other that has been in the cinema before. It was absolutely spell-binding, and especially in 3-D and shown on the largest IMAX screen in London, England. Moreovoer, my wife and I found it not only a totally gripping film experience but also to be a very emotional film and story indeed.<br/><br/>My strongest advice to anyone wishing to see this film is this: DO NOT read anything about the film or its story before you go to the cinema. Simply, DO NOT. Instead, go the cinema with a 'blank canvas' of a mind and allow the film and its magical story to wash over you and unfold.<br/><br/>Interestingly and throughout, I spotted how this film, in a review, could also be called \"Avatar\" meets \"A Man Called Horse\" meets \"Jurassic Park\" meets \"The Lost World\" meets \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\". That is, put simply, there is clear evidence in the film how certain cultural influences have obviously had an effect on the director James Cameron over the years. As such, he deserves all the credit and congratulations he receives for such a truly masterful work. And in a couple of months' time, the film should walk away with any number of well deserved Oscars.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar reportedly cost a staggering 230 to 310 million dollars if you are prepared to believe what Wikipedia claims. Me, I can't help thinking I'd rather have had either Terminator 5 or Aliens 7 or, given the budget, both.<br/><br/>Go and see Avatar for the visual spectacle – and believe me when I say that describing the visuals as spectacular is an understatement. Pandora is beautifully conceived and rendered, though obviously by people who have never been in a forest in their lives given the lack of dead trees, dead leaves, mud and general detritus. The plants, animals and people are convincing and beautiful.<br/><br/>The critics have been going on about this being a breakthrough in film-making technology but I can't see it. It looks good but doesn't look better than, say, Lord of the Rings. The wholly animated alien people, plants and animals are no more impressive than the CGI Gollum was a few years ago. I actually felt rather disappointed, I was expecting something new but this is more of the same computer jiggery-pokery.<br/><br/>Do not go and see it for the plot and writing. The plot is a monumentally formulaic \"don't hurt the environment, man\" riff. We have seen all the characters before in a hundred other films: the driven research scientist who's brilliance allows her to be rude to everyone; the greedy corporate schill prepared to do anything to ensure a profit; the battle hardened colonel with an itchy trigger finger; etcetera ad infinitum. The dialogue, while not awful, is dull and unmemorable, lacking any humour or wit.<br/><br/>Go and see it, the critics like it, most people like it, you'll probably like it. I thought it was okay with a side order of gigantically missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Spoiler <br/><br/>Giant corporation, \"The Company\" (Weyland-Yutani perhaps), plans to strip-mine the Eden-like planet/moon Pandora*. All that stands in their way are a race of technologically primitive aboriginals, the Na'vi (who suffer from what literary grammatologists call the \"Fantasy apostrophe\").<br/><br/>Jake Sully, a paraplegic former marine, is recruited by The Company to operate the titular alien clone \"avatar\" originally made for his deceased twin brother. Sigourney Weaver's driven botanist/anthropologist wants him to help her study the aliens and their environment. Colonel Doombringer wants him to deliver intelligence on the aliens so that he can destroy them and Mr Corporate McEvil (Giovani Ribisi) wants him to persuade the Na'vi to leave their giant tree house so that he can drill for the precious unobtainum beneath it**.<br/><br/>Jake, however, quickly becomes enamoured by the culture and ways of the Na'vi and his teacher, a stunningly gorgeous Na'vi called Neytiri (voice and, I assume, movements of Zoe Saldana). Coming to value the environmental harmony in which the Na'vi live, Jake leads them in a final battle to try to reclaim their world from the humans***.<br/><br/>End Spoiler <br/><br/>Expect a director's cut a few years after the DVD comes out where the voice-over has been removed and a bunch of unnecessary scenes added back in.<br/><br/>* Who names a planet Pandora, for God's sake? Seriously? Anyone who knows their mythology knows that Pandora's Box contained all the world's evil. It's like saying \"I know, we'll call it Deathworld, that sounds nice right?\".<br/><br/>** A quick google search indicates that \"Unobtainium\" is the material that Oakley use to make the frames for their shades (check it out if you don't believe me). This suggest the fascinating concept that, in the future, Oakley sunglasses have become humanity's primary means of exchange.<br/><br/>*** !BIG SPOILER!

The hanging mountains, the mysterious and abundant creatures (some truly nasty animals that were conjured up from imagination) and even the indigenous Na'Vi tribe... all marvels of CGI.<br/><br/>The movie is almost 3 hours long, but it's so exciting and action-packed and a delight on the senses that it's never noticeable. The acting was more than adequate, with Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldanha and Stephen Lang probably the standouts.<br/><br/>The final battle scene is exciting and a sight to behold.

The story is really gripping and the way the story has been told is award deserving. James Cameron is back with a bang after nearly a decade, and what a jump he has made of genres. From a romantic drama called Titanic, to a pathbreaking cinematic 3D experience called Avatar.<br/><br/>While watching this movie, I was so involved with whatever I saw, just like Jake Sully, I started connecting with the world of the Na'vi, and felt anger when the humans starting demolishing it. This is the magic and affect of the storytelling of James Cameron. He uses the complete first hour to make the audience connect and create love for that earth-like world of the Na'vi, the creatures on the planet and the beautiful nature.<br/><br/>The way James Cameron has written, handled and directed the story deserves accolades and awards, I have never felt this amazed by a movie before. Performances of the movie are of A+ class quality, even though the movie does not have big names yet, the characterisation of each and every actor is completely in sync with the characters of the movie. <br/><br/>Sam Worthington has done a commendable job as Jake Sully, he is very convincing, and has honest expressions. Jake in his Avatar form is absolutely lovable, and has been executed perfectly. Zoe Saldana as Neytiri is beautiful, she truly looks like the princess of the race, and has done a remarkable job. The supporting cast is absolutely wonderful and very impactful.<br/><br/>The dosing of humour is perfect, not too much, and not too less of it. The 3D special effects are a milestone in the history of 3D cinematic experiences. Never has any special effect involved me so much. The natural environment looks astonishing and absolutely beautiful, the way production has been designed is very peaceful. The creators of the exterior of this movie have done a commendable job.<br/><br/>All in all, I can't describe my feelings for this movie in a review. You have to see this movie with your own eyes, you have to experience it in order to understand what Avatar has to offer. <br/><br/>Go watch it, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

I'm happy I saw it at an IMax theater, and I'll definitely do it again.It just deserves to be seen again and again, at a theater.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" is \"numero uno\" at my top 5 list of the year and definitely among my top 3 list ever!Why not even at first...<br/><br/>I loved the movie and I'm sure you'll do as well!!!

All I know is that seven of us walked out of the theater two months ago (Christmas Day) and looked at one another and said, \"Yeah, well, that was okay...\" Which is not a ringing endorsement.<br/><br/>The plot was weak, the graphics were great, and as far as acting, well, it was all done in front of a blue screen so you can't really fault anyone for that. Ridley Scott was probably either horrified or pleased that someone could have all this technology and get it so wrong; if I were in his brilliant shoes I'd be laughing. Cameron is a good director, but what is there to direct when it's all CGI? Of course Sigourney Weaver is terrific, but even she can't breathe life into this project. I don't actually give a tinker's damn about the Academy Awards because they so often get it wrong -- nowadays it's about money and some other ephemeral, meaningless things, not talent or art, perhaps just skill -- but if this gets the best film award I will be convinced that there is someone behind it all pulling the strings. Strictly entertainment, and I give it a two to bring the overall ratings down.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is an excellent movie by any standard, but in 3-D it truly stands as the new gold standard in fantasy and/or sci-fi entertainment. Multiple elements make this a great movie: good story line with moral depth, interesting characters that we can care about (and the real brilliance here, of course, is that the avatar characters are as interesting, if not more so, than the \"real life\" characters), fabulous rich cinematography, seamless CG and special effects, and of course venturing into a brilliantly colored, multi-dimensional and mesmerizing world we've never seen before. In a packed theater, the end of this film came with enthusiastic applause from almost everyone in attendance -- interestingly, the last time I experienced a really identical experience was Titanic. Go figure! What more can be asked of a movie? Only the future will answer this question.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">When I first heard about this film I was looking forward to it a lot but I must admit when I saw the trailer it didn't really do it for me. It wasn't what I thought it would look like. But as I like every other James Cameron film I thought I would check it out and I must say it is spectacular. I didn't think I would like but it is one of the best films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The visual effects are just amazing. There is no other word to describe it. Pandora actually felt like it was real. It was that good. The attention to detail was brilliant. It just looked so realistic, visually stunning. The scene where Jake learns how to fly looked amazing. The dragon like creatures looked very real and were very well designed. I loved it when Jake and Neytiri were racing down the side of the mountain. The camera angle they got on that was brilliant.<br/><br/>The last 30 minutes of the film was just breathtaking. I mean it was all systems go. It was non stop action the whole way. James done a great job of putting that together. It was just so well done. They had some great moments when it went slow motion. That was brilliant. It was just so mad with all helicopters and the navi in the air taking each other out.<br/><br/>Colonel Miles who was played by Stephen Lang was the best character for me. He played him so well that he really made you hate him because he was just so brutal. He just didn't really care about anyone. He just pretty much wanted everyone dead. The look of his character was spot on, making him big and mean and having those scars across his face.<br/><br/>Also the navi looked really good. I mean loads of people were saying they looked rubbish in the trailer but on the big screen they looked amazing. It was just amazing how they got the facial expression looking so good. I mean when Jake jumped in the lake when he was being chased it looked so real when the water was dripping from his face.<br/><br/>James Cameron can definitely be happy with this film. He just never disappoints. Some of his camera angles were brilliant. They were just so clever. I mean the end battle must have taken him ages to film, let alone edit. <br/><br/>This film is definitely one was best films I have ever seen and gets me really excited to see what the film industry could be like in a few years to come with technology like this. It is so entertaining and will have you glued to the screen throughout the whole film and wanting to see what Cameron can come up with next. I can't wait to see what the sequel will be like.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It's the holiday season again, and I just got the 3-disc \"Extended Edition\" of James Cameron's AVATAR as a Christmas present. I've just read that the set holds three versions of the film, the other two just adding certain scenes for the sake of the fans. You might call me a fan of the film (although I don't think it's worth building a religion on, ala STAR WARS), so this is a great DVD loaded with special features (more than the standard version) and it also includes the \"extended\" and \"unreleased\" version of the film that may not really be something you can't miss if you've already seen AVATAR or have it on the standard DVD already, but at least it makes my stay in Pandora just a little longer.<br/><br/>AVATAR has its flaws, definitely. Even in its scale, there are certain elements that might still bother me, even after the nth time I've seen the film. But in the end, in spite of its occasionally cheesy dialogue and simple story, AVATAR is best judged as a whole movie-going experience. I loved it when I saw it on the big screen on 3D, but it grew on me even more the 2nd or 3rd or 4th time I saw it on DVD. It's like we are all avatars in a world James Cameron has created. It's a gorgeous experience; a new leap in movie-making technology built around the service of what is basically an old-fashioned storytelling. I'd choose the term \"old-fashioned\" over \"trite\" when describing AVATAR. The oft criticism that the story resembles those of DANCES WITH WOLVES and FERNGULLY don't come nearly as condescending to me. I love that the movie builds its entirely new world in the basis of an old-fashioned adventure story. Cameron take what makes these stories work (the characters we care about, the epic spectacle we crave) and throw them in with the latest in technological advancements.<br/><br/>It may have just been a case of an unrestrained ego that Cameron called his AVATAR a \"game-changer\" or \"new wave in filmmaking\", but it's certainly a new way we can look at movies. The 3D technology here is not just another throwaway gimmick with a few scenes that pop out of the screen at our expense; Cameron uses it to serve the story. The impressive 3D used in AVATAR immerses us into the experience, right down to the beauty of the fictional Pandora universe to the very heart of the battle near the end. It's amazing how far the technology for making movies has come (but judging from the current and crappy use of 3D again nowadays, some lesser filmmaker have yet to use it wisely). The dynamo technology used for AVATAR may just be in the service of a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster, but in time (hopefully) other directors will use the technology to make something that would change movie-making for the better (no more of this \"shaky cam\" nonsense please!).<br/><br/>I have lived in a generation where shaky and headache-inducing movies like TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN get passed as entertainment, so it's fun to see a technically-impressive and yet old-fashioned and entertaining blockbuster like AVATAR, which restores my faith in what Hollywood blockbusters can do when they're done right.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Great movie entertainment that is simply spectacular with action, emotion, and movie-house morality. I really liked the realistic way the animated Na'vi moved so gracefully though the trees, and later through the air. The movie characters were evocative and emotional -- unlike most motion capture characters, and even better than Lord of the Ring's Gollum -- far better than Disney's A Christmas Carol. <br/><br/>Writer/director Cameron rapidly sets up the conflict between the humans and the Na'vi. Jake and the audience spends a long time with the Na'vi, and the wonderful visual world they inhabit. The audience is won over by the time the bulldozers arrive.<br/><br/>Although the story is predictable, that is because it is archetypal. The story is like the European migration into North America and the displacement of the native Americans. Visually it is more like Europeans coming to tropical Africa -- perhaps like displacement of natives in Nigeria for petroleum. There is the more elemental conflict between the spiritual, grounded and connected natives with the mechanized and money-grubbing humans.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington's performance as Jake shows his emotional shift in loyalties, and this is the best performance in the film. The supporting characters are one-dimensional. Zoe Saldana's Neytiri is combative and cat-like. I am not sure she handles the slow scenes as well as she might. I liked seeing Sigorney Weaver too. <br/><br/>I want to see it again.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I missed the initial theatrical release of Avatar in Devember of 2009, but I got the DVD the following July and watched the movie on my television at home, and I was quite blown away. My liking for it has decreased. How I feel about the story, characters, and everything else about the movie is pretty much exactly the same, but to a lesser degree; I think it's okay.<br/><br/>The story is set in the year 2154, and it involves an RDA mission to an earth-sized moon called Pandora. We enter this new world through the eyes of Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex-marine who goes on this mission on short notice. For a while, the humans had some success in interacting with the Na'vi via \"avatars\", remote-controlled bodies. However, relations between the natives and the human have turned bad, and all interactions between them stopped. However, Jake eventually meets the local native tribe, falls in love with them and the new world, and ends up fighting against the RDA in defense of the new people and world he now considers his home.<br/><br/>Let's get the obvious out of the way: the CGI is visually stunning and almost flawless, and with extreme detail. In fact, the movie goes beyond having great visuals. It introduces a wonderful new world. It has a lot of earth-like characteristics, but it also has a lot of new and exotic characteristics (and even some uniqueness in the familiar characteristics) the combination of which is a beautiful world. Overall, the world is something we've all seen before, yet never seen before at the same time; simultaneously old and new. And it's all portrayed excellently with brilliant scope and spectacle. The same is true about the natives and the avatars. Like the new world, they are portrayed excellently with the CGI with utmost detail. The natives are humanoids, but they're ten to twelve feet tall, blue-skinned, and golden-eyed, and they even have tails. They are an interesting blend of human, alien, and feline. The same is true about the avatars. The Na'vi were well designed, especially Neytiri, who is beautiful. I found Jake and Neytiri to be very likable, and a great couple, and their combined physical appearance and personalities give them a likability that pierces through the special effects.<br/><br/>That's not to say that everything about the film is perfect. The story is extremely basic, derivative, clichéd, and predictable, and a bit corny. The characters, aside from Jake, Neytiri, and Grace, are pretty shallow, especially the villains, who are very one-dimensional (but effective). Also, the dialogue is very clichéd and a bit corny, almost like something out of a kids movie. However, despite these flaws, the movie works. The story clichéd, predictable, etc., but it's coherent, well-structured, well-paced, solid, and consistent, and it flows. The characters, although lacking a bit in development, are effective. The three protagonists Jake, Neytiri, and Grace, should have been better in terms of development, but they are effective and I was able to have a sufficient emotional attachment to them and their relationships. Even the dialogue, weak as it is, gets its job done.<br/><br/>We've seen this story a million times, but never like this. The story could be considered a sci-fi version of Pocahontas or Dances With Wolves, set in a new fantasy world. Just like in original Star Wars trilogy, Avatar brings some new life into old clichés. In my opinion, the original Star Wars trilogy does a much better job at this, but Avatar does an okay job at it. The story combines elements of Pocahontas, Titanic, Braveheart, Star Wars, and even The Matrix.James Cameron also borrows from some of his own films, including Aliens (military/technology) and Titanic (the love story, and the way the movie is structured).<br/><br/>Also, the new world isn't simply in the movie to look nice. In my opinion, it actually feels alive, and it's very much a character itself in the film. I want to make it clear that I was not duped or blinded by the visuals. I felt that Cameron actually used the visuals and new world to evoke emotion, and also used them as part of the story itself. In terms of the script, the storytelling is basic, by the numbers, but I also felt that a lot of the storytelling was within these great visuals and the world, and in the way it was combined into the story. The effects helped me get immersed into the new world and helped me care about the characters and the story. Also, the film has great sound - quality, effects, editing, etc. These sound aspects also added a bit to the emotion and immersing effects of the story. I also liked James Horner's score, which, in my opinion, is some of the best work of Horner's career.<br/><br/>I felt that a lot of what made the story enjoyable was within the simplicity, and in the details. And, in my opinion, while the film doesn't have much intelligence, it does have a little bit, which very few other movies like this have. It's actually a halfway decent blockbuster, and it does not contain the obnoxiousness and imbecility of films like Michael Bay's films. Unlike those films, Avatar actually has some heart and soul, and characters that the audience can care about. There are definitely several things that can be criticized - the simple and derivative story, the clichés, the hammy dialogue, and the one-dimensional villains - but a lot can be said in defense of the movie's story aspects (and it has a lot of Cameron elements in it). Besides, these flaws are typical of blockbusters.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was okay. I found it sufficiently emotional, memorable, and entertaining, and it's nice family entertainment. However, the movie that changes movies?? No way.<br/><br/>My Rating: *** (out of ****)<br/><br/>For more reviews, and my complete review of Avatar, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I can't believe I haven't rated this movie yet! It is one of my all-time favourite movies! - \"Why?\" - \"Why not?\"<br/><br/>It has brilliant actors. It looks gorgeous. It has superb music. It has a well-developed world building with its own fauna and flora. It displays an interesting culture with an actual credible foreign language. It has a beautiful spiritual theme. It has a great humorous script with a structured outline and perfect pacing. ...<br/><br/>Okay, there's the originality issue. Well, I think my definition of originality is somewhat different than \"Something that has never been done before\". Because it's very hard to claim that for anything. Every idea is based on something, either consciously or subconsciously. I consider the story of The Hunger Games to be a very original one and the writer admitted it was kind of a 'gladiator games meets reality soaps' world. \"So what?!\" 'Originality' is actually the favourite argument of most hypocrites because it's a very subjective concept you can use in favour of everything you like and to the disadvantage of what you don't like. If you really try, you can find as many arguments to call anything original as you can call it \"stolen from X or Y\", \"A meets Z\" or \"based on B\". <br/><br/>To me, originality is about doing something creative and personal with something, whether it's been done or not. Avatar is more original than a lot of other movies in that respect. So what if it's \"Pocahontas in Space\" or \"the Last Samurai on Pandora\". It is a classic but very emotionally powerful story in an original setting with timeless themes.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie in the theatres six times and a seventh time as an extended version. Then I've seen it 'god knows how many times' on DVD. One can hardly call it a bad movie then, if it's even possible to call any movie bad 100% objectively (except for the Room maybe). But if such true piece of cooperative art does not impress anymore than I'm afraid of what still will for future generations... (Oh, right, it's Man of Steel and the Dark Knight...) I definitely found this movie Oscar-worthy although I don't think the Academy is going to give the fantasy genre the respect it deserves any time soon. To me, this was one of the best movies in years. And I think, in the end, if you see the box office results, most people will agree with that.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Please google 'avatar is bad', or your choice of a more pejorative adjective, to save me re-hashing that here.<br/><br/>Don't believe all the love it's got on here!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar grew in my expectations as its release date got closer and closer. Seeing the trailer at first I thought it would be a cool looking movie but nothing I would see. Then I found out James Cameron directed it and everything in my head changed. Suddenly all of the fantastic reviews came out and come the time I went and saw it my expectations had soared for this film. I am glad to say, I was not let down.<br/><br/>The story is a bit generic and the script is filled with some of Cameron's trademark corny-ness, but that doesn't take away from anything. Though the plot is generic it is still intriguing, and original in its own very special way. The acting was spectacular throughout as well.<br/><br/>As everyone knows however, the main reason for this movie was to push the limit on the world of special effects in Hollywood. Needless to say, Cameron got it done, this film will revolutionize film-making from this stage forth. The effects were stunning, quite simply, unlike anything I had ever seen before. And in 3D it was an even more unique and beautiful experience. Cameron has always been and remains so particular about what goes into his shot, and therefore every shot of every scene is just fantastically visually crafted to make this made up world seem real. It was shocking to see how expansive and how gracefully Cameron's world interacted with the various character's in the story, and it made for a truly one of a kind experience.<br/><br/>This film will mark a turning point in the genre, as most all of Cameron's movies do. I would be stunned if Cameron didn't nab another best director Oscar for this one. See it, it is an experience more than a film, you won't regret it. 9/10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">That's a lot for me to do an analysis of this movie, I saw in theaters in 2009 and I liked. By saw this movie recently with a closer look and I was surprised this movie try not to amaze the person with a story that can be guessed after the first 15 minutes. Apparently James Cameron, was more interested to build a universe in which he could launch several consecutive films and try to profit from inside and outside the theaters. The extremely limited characters in the third act, and many of them ending in a chiché outcome make the most painful experience in the final moments of the movie even worse. Only to be seen as technological curiosity, as they were the best special effects in 2009 and nothing more.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">With \"Avatar\" James Cameron practically bludgeons us with his own brand of \"green\" political correctness. Let's see ... An advanced race of people invade a serene wilderness in order to subjugate the peaceful natives. No, that doesn't sound anything like the leftist drivel passing for American history today, does it? Politics aside, the movie is breathtaking in its scope, with special effects that are nothing short of miraculous. Viewers are certainly drawn into the world of Pandora. Watching the movie, with its green-screen wonderment, provides a welcome escape from our everyday lives. Unfortunately, this movie fails us in other ways. While I certainly don't share the tree-hugging politics of Cameron and his ilk, I could have appreciated the movie more if he would have at least inserted some nuance into the characters. Instead, we have the stereotypical colonel trampling the forest and mowing down the peaceful aliens while spouting B-movie lines. Oh well, guess you can't have everything, even for $250 million.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I love it. I loved it in 2009 and and I still love it now in 2020. Watched it so many times that I lost count already. It's just amazing perspective of our shallow reality vs fantasy world with most beautiful views. I would like to be part of that magical world too. Nowadays when life is getting more and more crazy and trivial.... It's just nice to get into that imaginary world even for just two hours to feel how it would be to be back in harmony with the mother nature..... I love the idea. Can not wait for continuation. Best movie ever for me!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Cinematics were great, and still to this day, about no other movie accomplished this movie's goal. Shots were expertly used to have an actual 6th sense. But to be fair with that, the world was pretty bland. It's just a huge forrest. There were more characters than necessary and even the motivations for the main protagonist were way too simple to have a 2 hour and 40 minute screening about. Plus the acting kind of resembles some acting I've seen in budget drama movies before.<br/><br/>Even though these are negatives, the capture of the whole place made it feel more than just a forrest; a camera's fantasy playground.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Fantastic CGI but Bad Story and the usual big blockbuster cliches\n",
       " C+</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's a feat of technical prowess, the visuals look fantastic, photo real. The animation looks smooth, there were only a couple of moments in the entire film that didn't quite gel perfectly from a visual point of view.<br/><br/>The story is simple, very very simple. Painfully simple if you stop to think about it while the movie is progressing. It's predictable and unsurprising... and irrelevant.<br/><br/>The effects are great, seeing it in 3D was fantastic. I must see film, a must see in 3D.<br/><br/>It's probably the cinematic experience of 2009, go see it, just don't look past for a story past that visual feast.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It took me 11 years to see Avatar. After finally seeing it, I must say... It was decent. Which, in and of itself, was a bummer. I was expecting an epic and emotionally impactful adventure in a similar fashion to Terminator 2 or Alita Battle Angel. While I didn't hate it, it just lacked that James Cameron magic. The story was decent and the politics weren't nearly as shoehorned as I expected, but it jusn't didn't deliver.<br/><br/>Now, I have to admit that the visuals in this movie are phenomenal. This movie is over a decade old, but the effects still hold up. Quite a few scenes actually look BETTER than reality. I was astounded by the cgi, especially in the final battle scenes.<br/><br/>Sadly, that is the only thing that amazed me in this film. The protagonists were fairly unremarkable, and the villains were pathetically generic and stupid. There is just no way to sympathize with a guy that is bad because he's... bad. The character development happens sometime during a training montage, and as a result, no lasting connection is made between the viewer and the main characters.<br/><br/>Summary: A beautiful mask that hides a dissapointingly average face.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Well, this movie looks astounding. There's no getting around that. Avatar is a technical marvel, a movie aglow in bright, vibrant colors and gorgeous special effects that create one of the more memorable fictional settings in some time: the planet of Pandora.<br/><br/>There, however, lies the film's first stumble. When sci-fi classics like Star Wars and Blade Runner take the time to draw the audience into the world, Avatar gives us a perfunctory introduction, before launching into a clichéd \"training montage\". There's no nuance to the film's depiction of the planet, or the Na'vi people. I realized with disappointment that the film was treating Pandora as little more than a giant zoo, full of amazing sights that it wouldn't analyze at more than an arm's length. Likewise, the Na'vi people are explored at such little depth that anyone who has seen any movie of this type (The Last Samurai, Dances With Wolves) i.e., \"Simple, wise people versus destructive, mindless power\" can figure out their lifestyle, motives, and the plot of the film.<br/><br/>And that is where I began to realize that I'd get nothing more from this film than some great eye candy. There isn't a single memorable character in the film. Every single one is a cookie-cutter cliché, and the actors make no attempt to create any kind of individual persona. You have your conflicted hero, your wise scientist, your female interest who will see through the prejudices her family hold against the hero, an evil military man, and a single-minded corporate bigwig. These archetypes can work, but only when given motives beyond the requirements of their cliché.<br/><br/>And so, the result is a movie that is predictable from the first frame, and that features remarkable visuals that could have been so much more. Watching it, I couldn't help but think of Hayao Miyazaki's brilliant Princess Mononoke, which handled similar subject matter with infinitely more nuance and grace. In Miyazaki's film, characters who could be reduced to stereotypes are given complex motives. The battle between good and evil is tempered by multiple shades of grey. And, most of all, Miyazaki takes the time to truly absorb us in the world of his creation, rather than pulling us by the arm to take us to the next plot point.<br/><br/>Despite my many issues with Avatar, I think it's worth seeing for its visuals alone. It really is a great technological achievement. I just wish I had seen in it the great film that so many else have.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">As I sat groaning with boredom at the tired \"indigenous population\" theme hacked up all afresh for the new decade, I pondered on many possibilities concerning these particular \"not so little\" indians: Wonder what their life expectancy is? infant mortality rate? death rate from barbaric maturity rituals? etc., all typically left out of the deification of the indigenous population theme in every Hollywood treatment of such... wonder why? Next time we go back, lets be sure to take more beads, firewater and smallpox laden blankets. Maybe that's upcoming in AvaTwo, \"Big-Little Horn.\" Oh, and let's not forget the Idyllic ecosystem, where every entity is quite literally \"plugged in.\" Intellectually and politically dishonest tripe with no character development (I want my legs back! I am an evil military man! I am a thoughtless corporate wonk! I am the fiery, independent femalien! I am the crusty and arrogant scientist with a heart of gold!).<br/><br/>Finally, Giovanni Ribisi is miscast more thoroughly than in any of the thousands of roles in any of the thousands of movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>A perfect movie for the WalMart masses.<br/><br/>4 stars for good 3D.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Vivid, enveloping &amp; transcendent - James Cameron approaches Avatar with the same grandeur as Titanic.<br/><br/>Sci-fi is honestly not my cup of tea, but this is exquisite and I am not ashamed to say that I ugly cried during the film (more than once).<br/><br/>The special effects are absolutely tremendous!!! Alongside the glorious visuals, the iridescent canvas and the fine-tuned sounds of Pandora's ecosystem &amp; it's vast array of animals- Avatar is perhaps the closest we'll come to venturing into a new world (since Lord of the Rings &amp; Jurassic Park).<br/><br/>For all it's visual flair, Cameron does not abandon the art of storytelling.\n",
       " At the films core is the love story forming between Jake &amp; Neytiri, which is ever so subtle - stirring emotion with longing glances &amp; widening pupils (the CGI is honestly fantastic at capturing this) but underneath it all the narrative flaunts a strong pro green / anti-war message (that really hits home when you think of its relevance both historically &amp; presently)<br/><br/>The concept of Jake's liberation through his avatar was extremely clever. From the opening, where we soar the skies with him in his dreams - I felt very invested in his characters struggles. The scene he runs for the first time, squishing the dirt in-between his toes felt reminiscent to the \"Run, Forest Run\" scene in Forrest Gump - and his entire journey of spiritual awakening was very uplifting. (loved that the opening &amp; final scenes are both close ups of his eyes - one dreaming/one awake)<br/><br/>The final 40 minutes of the film is action packed, and filmed flawlessly. The slow motion shots really let you relish the moment / the feel of the battle, and the aftermath of the \"Destruction of Home tree\" hit hard!!! (Mo'at wailing/the song that plays😭)<br/><br/>All actors involved were brilliant, but Zoe Saldana &amp; Sigourney Weaver top the list. I cannot wait for Avatar 2 to be released (roll on 2021). Also - the transition shot of Tom Sully being cremated &gt; Jake waking up in Cryo was so cool. I can't help but wonder if Tom's death was a cover up by RDA...hopefully avatar 2 will clear that up)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">With great expectations, my guest and I laid down $20.00 for a matinée, to view the greatest 3D film ever to be shown on the silver screen! Three fourths of the way through, I was still looking for that film. To be more precise, I felt as though I had gone through a time machine, to my youth in the 1950's on a Saturday afternoon, watching 35 cartoons and two 3D science fiction films. Avatar was the same old Cowboys and Indians all over again but in reverse. On the planet Pandora, humans are seeking the path to unlimited power at the cost of the indigenous population. The name of the planet, Pandora, should give the audience a clue, that maybe this is a box better left closed. The citizens of Pandora live in harmony with each other and their entire planet. The humans, who want to study the Na'vi, incubate Avatars in which they can join psychologically and mingle with the general population. The company the scientists work for are a paramilitary organization who will stop at nothing to obtain their goal. So we have the Na'vi on one side and the paramilitary on the other side, who do you think will win? Does the name of the film give you the slightest hint? I thought so. James Cameron who wrote and directed this 3D film to end all 3D films should have stopped at 120 minutes and left the other 40 for his director's cut.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">This movie has been praised for its graphics and at some instances criticized for its plot. I have not watched Pocahontas but I do believe that many of the main ideas have been repeated in the past. To me this isn't necessarily a flaw. History repeats itself and just as we haven't learned from our past crimes we do not seem to be learning from our current ones either. So I think Cameron tries to make some crucial points clear for once more to a wide pop-corn audience which expects mainly visual sensations.<br/><br/>Expressions used in this film such as 'Shock and Awe' and 'Terror' reveal, even to the unsuspected, the parallels drawn here with current irrational warfare mostly for the control of markets and resources.<br/><br/>There is a strong environmental agenda and ultimately there is revolution. The messages are clear and relevant. Yet they may fall short in being convincing. The natives bear too many cultural similarities to humans. They speak in polysyllabic words, are monogamous, use similar tools, gather and sing to evoke something spiritual, the women's concept of femininity is similar to ours etc\n",
       "  Of course all this is done in order for us to relate to them as much as possible.<br/><br/>Some cheesy disneyish romance, along with romantic views on natives that look like North American Natives and sing to African tunes, make also part of the Hollywood gloss.<br/><br/>What chiefly kept me interested was the ongoing switching of the marine's world from that of the artificial human environment to the natural non-human one. It is within those transformations that his dilemmas are understood and his character develops.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an entertaining experience with beautiful imagery and pertinent messages. There is room for more character development and intricacy, especially from the part of the natives.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Let's give credit where credit is due. Avatar is one of the most astonishing films ever released in the last few years. It's the experience of a lifetime, an adventure beyond your wildest dreams. Its visuals are unlike anything you will ever see in any other film. James Cameron, one of my all-time favorite directors, does it yet again. He breaks new ground in the world of special effects. But the obvious weakness of the film is the story. It's one in which most of us have already heard before: An evil corporation tries to take over another world, but two people from each side fall in love and try to stop a war between the two worlds. This story already comes from childhood films like Pocahontas, FernGully: The Last Rainforest, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire. The visuals in the film are amazing, but even they can't make up for an overused story, which is why I'm giving this film an 8/10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Collectively the media write the world of Pandora is beautiful. I ask 'to whom'.<br/><br/>Its a bit like being in a bad floral nightclub - quite ugly colour &amp; lighting clashing together. The utopian animals are violent, exaggerated ie lets give them 6 legs and four eyes etc long way to go re special effects. This movie lessens the naturally exceptional world we live in right now.<br/><br/>Big big guns, really bad cartoon acting (I suppose this was directed), script to match.<br/><br/>Why did I go.........got the short straw! Best I say no more.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Just came back from it.<br/><br/>If you guys are gonna see it, do not go to the dollar cinema. Unless that dollar cinema has 3D IMAX equipped and ready to go, you'll only get nearly half the experience. The movie itself is good, very good even if you put aside the fact Dances with Wolves did it before (maybe better, I dunno, I haven't seen that movie myself). Its a classic nature vs. technology story. The opening is completely amazing and the ending is jawdropping. And the great thing about it is the special effects are not the star of the show. Nay, they...and get this....actually enhance the story and characters. Get that, eh? That's exactly what I and many other people complain about when it comes to these effects driven movies. And Cameron apparently answered that calling.<br/><br/>There are a couple of moments that are truly amazing, but other than that it's nothing groundbreaking (apart from the technology I guess). Its just a really entertaining movie. The only things that keep me from giving it even a 9 (and it was pretty close) were a few slow moments, some cheesy dialogue, and very derivative almost uninspired looking creature designs. That aside the characters get better as the movie goes along, Cameron is pretty much still the king of the action genre cause a lot of the battle scenes were fantastic, the story gets more involving even if it is predictable (and admittedly, feeling a tad rushed), and in the end it felt satisfying. Yea I paid $13.00 but it was $13.00 well spent. Movies to me are about the experience, not really how unpredictable the story can be or witty the dialogue is, and it succeeded I think. <br/><br/>The 3D, even in IMAX, I have to say is breathtaking. I actually felt like I was in the world. Most other 3D movies I went to felt like a really cheap pop up book. Not here. They made specific objects pop-out and set them up really carefully to actually give a 3D illusion. It helps immerse you into the entire thing, which is why I want to watch it again without all the fancy stuff. But even if that tech wasn't there, I think it would've been a great movie anyway. And I had a pretty bad seat too. I'm thinking of going back in there, sit in the best seat an hour ahead of time (it was filling up 45 minutes prior when I got there), and see it again to get the best possible experience out of it.<br/><br/>8.8/10<br/><br/>PS: As a side note, i'm gonna give my personal top 4 SCI-FI films for 2009:<br/><br/>1. D9 (9.2/10) 2. Star Trek (9/10) 3. Avatar (8.8/10) 4. Moon (7.5/10)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Having now seen Avatar I can safely say I can see why there is so much hype. This movie does contain the best CG and 3D ever incorporated into a feature film. The acting here was also moderately better than I had anticipated seeing and the blending of all the elements together was very well done and did leave a sense of wonder.<br/><br/>The problem, and I know others will see this soon, is that this movie will not stand up very long. The story is very un-original and the characters quickly forgettable. There will be sequels made that will not be as good as the first time you see this film.<br/><br/>It is amazing what they can do now visually, I can't wait to see it combined with an original story.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I haven't watched Avatar for a while, but I used to watch it frequently and until Disney's Frozen came out, it was my favourite movie. I loved the original version but personally I think you should watch the extended edition to truly appreciate this extraordinary movie.<br/><br/>James Cameron certainly knew what he was doing when he created this film and put his all into the project. All the performers did great work, with fantastic performances from Sigourney Weaver, Zoey Saldana, Sam Worthington, Michelle Rodriguez, Stephan Lang and Giovanni Ribishi.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver, who in my eyes is one of the greatest actresses I've ever seen - she's definitely in the top ten, perhaps even top five - made Grace Augustine a snarky, feisty and rather rude woman who was hiding a loving, maternal side as well as a great deal of emotional pain, particularly in regards to the destruction of her school. By the way, if you want to fully appreciate Sigourney's performance in this movie, you need to see Grace's discussion with Jake about the school and that is only shown in the special edition.<br/><br/>I've seen Sam Worthington in Clash of the Titans and Wrath of the Titans, but he was at his finest in Avatar, making Jake Sully into a sarcastic and fierce warrior who also had a childish wonder for the world around him. You also see Jake develop throughout the movie. Initially he seems like a \"dumb grunt\" but grows into a charismatic leader. His love for Neytiri felt very genuine, thanks to the excellent chemistry between Sam and Zoey.<br/><br/>I wouldn't put Zoey Saldana as high as Sigourney Weaver on my list of most talented actresses, but she still did impressive work as the feisty Neytiri. If I had to criticize her, I'd say she was just a little over-the-top when Neytiri found out that Jake was a spy and when she was crying over her father. However to be fair, Neytiri was devastated in both of those scenes and it's perfectly in character for her to lash out when she's angry or distraught, so it was still a great performance. Despite being slightly over-the-top in those two scenes, Zoey proved that she is still capable of subtlety and I'm a guy who appreciates subtlety in a performance. For example there was Neytiri's little disapproving glance at Tsu'tey when Jake was about to catch his Ikran, her playful smile when Jake deliberately flew too close to her or the vulnerable look in her eyes when Jake acknowledged that Peyral was a good hunter. Regardless of whether Zoey's as good as Sigourney or not, she still made Neytiri my favourite character in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Giovanni Ribishi also did a great job by making Parker Selfridge a greedy but conflicted man whose greed was constantly warring with his moral guidelines. He was clearly disturbed by the destruction of the Na'vi's home and despite his assertion that they were \"savages\", it's obvious that he didn't really want to go to war with them.<br/><br/>The true villain of this story is without doubt Colonel Miles Quaritch. He was little more than an evil psychopath, who literally drank coffee whilst destroying an entire clan's home. Although not a deep character, Stephan Lang's performance was so strong that the simplicity of Quaritch doesn't really matter to me.<br/><br/>I haven't seen many movies starring Michelle Rodriguez - actually I'm not sure if I've seen her in any films outside of Avatar - but she was an excellent choice to play Trudy Chacon. From what I know of her, Michelle is most comfortable in the role of tough and feisty women so she fitted Trudy's character very well.<br/><br/>Those six were the greatest performances in the movie but I'll also give credit to CCH Pounder, Wes Studi, Laz Alonso and Joel David Moore; all of them did great jobs. Dileep Rao and Matt Gerald were rather forgettable but to be fair, their roles were too small for us to really see how skilled they are. However out of the two of them, Matt put on a better performance with what he had to work with.<br/><br/>The storyline is rather simple - my younger brother has described it as basically Pocahontas with blue aliens - but that in no way cheapens the experience. Sometimes a simple storyline is the greatest storyline. It depends on how it's told and this story is told extremely well so the predictability of the plot didn't bother me. Furthermore quite a few likable and/or important characters die in this film, showing that Cameron is not afraid to show the brutal reality of war.<br/><br/>Pandora is a beautiful moon - for those of you thinking it's a planet, believe it or not it's actually a moon despite being close to the size of Earth - and is alive with unique wildlife and plants. James Cameron did an excellent job of creating an entire new world. Aside from the Na'vi, my favourite aliens are the Toruk and Ikran.<br/><br/>Another thing to mention is that the special effects are magnificent. Admittedly, I'm no expert on special effects but the Na'vi, animals and plants all look incredibly realistic. If I'm not mistaken, Cameron had ideas for this film about a decade before it came out but waited until technology was more advanced in order to make it as realistic as possible. That was a wise decision and another sign of the passion and dedication he had for this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is probably James Cameron's greatest work since Titanic, perhaps even the greatest in his entire career. He has confirmed a sequel and I hope he puts as much effort into that as he has into this and creates another masterpiece. Only time will tell.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I must say that my hopes were not that high for Avatar after I saw the trailer (I thought that the CGI looked clunky!) but having just seen a 3D screening (not on an IMAX screen though) I must say that my initial cynicism was most definitely quelled. The story is a somewhat familiar one, but it is rendered here in a very loving manner and the world that Cameron has brought to life for us to behold is an extraordinarily beautiful one. The colours! The world of Pandora is populated with all kinds of spectacular flora and fauna - an early confrontation with a particularly vicious and razor toothed beast is particularly exhilarating, and the luminous overtones of the landscape are very warm to behold. I didn't find the long running time to be too much of a problem but I will say that I found that the 3D glasses make everything a touch too dark for my tastes.<br/><br/>The CGI is very nice and clean looking.....however I did notice that the character of Neytiri looked the best of all of the natives and Grace's Avatar looked the least good, IMHO. It seems like the most attention to detail was given to Neytiri's eyes? They did look amazing. Also, great to see Sigourney Weaver back in the fold. Plus she got the best lines of the whole film. Joel Moore's character has the worst lines in the film!<br/><br/>Compared to Cameron's other films....I'd probably put this one in the same bag as 'The Abyss'. Similar themes and a real sense of technical pioneering... but perhaps Cameron's next film will be his real latter day masterpiece? T2 did follow 'The Abyss' after all. Let's just wait and see....<br/><br/>Oh! And one last thing - I think that Michelle Rodriguez is hot.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I had high expectations going into Avatar. Now I admit, it's probably stupid to go into any movie with expectations that are too high, lest they be crushed. However, even without high expectations, Avatar impresses only on a technical level, and on that level only. The story is very predictable, and as I watched this movie I was overcome with a feeling as if I had seen this all before in something in a made for TV movie on SyFy. This is pretty bad considering this is the same guy who made The Abyss and Terminator. I can only say that if you go see this movie, expect beautiful visuals... and a standard humdrum story that you've seen before if you follow any number of science fiction TV shows or just sci-fi in general. Oh, and if this is the 22nd century, why are they still using manually propelled wheelchairs?</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is intellectual without being pretentious. It is visually stimulating, it didn't even need the 3D aspect. If anything i thought the 3D cheapened it.<br/><br/>Cameron creates a world that mimic's ours but somehow it is better, because those 'blue people' understand what life is about. It's about unity, and coexisting, and something else we can't even imagine. The commentary Avatar makes on society without being preachy is successful. James Cameron gets multiple concepts across that are worth understanding and paying attention to. The film as a whole is engaging, worthy of every minute it ran past the standard movie length because it was more of an experience than a movie.<br/><br/>http://survialguide.blogspot.com/</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">My wife and I just saw this and were blown away. The visual effects are masterful and the 3D gimmick actually works well for a movie like this.<br/><br/>The theme is not original, but who cares. The movie just sucks you in. Picture it as \"Dances with Wolves,\"... future world. You have that sappy \"noble savage\" stuff combined with hostility towards the military, but the sci-fi fantasy mix works.<br/><br/>We went to see this flick with more curiosity than belief that it was really that good. But early on, the acting and direction was so good that it was apparent the movie had potential. But oh, those visual effects really were spectacular.<br/><br/>Throw in Aliens and Star Wars concepts and it's a well done, winning combination that holds your interest. Time flies and you walk away exclaiming \"wow.\"</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">... Which I must admit were not too high. I'm generally not a fan of sci-fi, and especially can't stand computer generated graphics in a movie. And predictably, I hated it at the start of the film. It all looked like a glorified cartoon. But soon enough I got immersed in the story and forgot about the cartoonish presentation.<br/><br/>I am generally a total sucker for movies about indigenous, 'primitive' people. In fact I'd love to learn from them how to live in the wild in various parts of the world, with no job, no mortgage, just hunting, gathering, and finding my place in nature and using its resources with skill. My favourite all-time movie is Apocalypto.<br/><br/>So it's no surprise really that this film entertained me. I'm not too fussed about 3D and the technical aspects, like I said if you don't get into the story, then it all looks like a video game, rather than a film.<br/><br/>Heard comments that this is as Anti-American movie. Hmmm I don't know, the movie certainly made heaps of money to some globalist Americans in Hollywood. Go figure. Maybe the makers are so arrogant they don't care what people think, as long as they get their money. I think the global market is increasingly anti-imperialist and eco-conscious, and the producers saw a demand for such a movie. Lucky for us. But wait till you can watch it cheap.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Plot: In 2154, the RDA begins mining on Pandora, a lush tropical planet in some distant galaxy. This planet is populated by the Na'vi, a race of blue, cat-like beings. In order to learn from the Na'vi, the Avatar program was created. In this, a human's mind is transported to that of a genetically created Na'vi. Disabled marine Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) is the latest to have an Avatar. His mission: learn from the Na'vi clan known as the Omaticaya and try to find a way to remove them from their homes, where a large deposit of a priceless mineral lies. But as Sully becomes attached to the Na'vi, including falling in love with princess Neytiri(Zoe Saldana), he realizes humans are the bad guys and must stop Col. Quaritch(Stephen Lang) and his soldiers from eliminating the Na'vi.<br/><br/>James Cameron has done it again! After Oscar-winning epics like Aliens, Terminator 2, and Titanic, he has once again captivated us with a surefire winner. This is a visual feast for the eyes that makes Transformers and 2012 look like indie flicks. The effects are by far the best ever done in film making, and I'm not going overboard. The work on the Na'vi is the most lifelike I've ever seen. These creatures look pretty well like their actors, so that's ten points for motion capture. And Cameron knows how to cast 'em. Among the cast is Wes Studi, Michelle Rodriguez, Joel David Moore, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, CCH Pounder, and Cameron regular Sigourney Weaver who steals most of her scenes. And another grand thing is the score by legendary Oscar winner James Horner, who's also worked on various projects with Cameron. His beats give the film a true native feel. And I fully suggest this be viewed in 3-D, as Cameron's style of filming deserves to only be shown in that way.<br/><br/>Last year, there was an incredible film called The Dark Knight, that became an Oscar winning billionaire that was easily the best of '08. Well, lightning might strike twice in the same spot with Avatar. This is the most flawless and satisfying film of the year. And maybe one of the best of the decade.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Fantastic for what it truly is, a visual spectacle. I give Cameron credit for showing us wonderful imagery and lifelike humanoid beings. What I don't give him credit for is the lousy and heavy-handed script and dialogue that seems to pound you over the head repeatedly with it's \"evil big-wig\" message. We get it, we're bad, they're good. This is all punctuated by one annoying character so I had to cringe whenever they talked. Regardless, it's simply a masterpiece for imagery in terms of the scope and grandeur. But I hope Cameron tones down his \"message\" for the sequel and just focus on the internal Pandora conflict, which will make for fantastic story-telling.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Cameron has successfully created a new level for cinematic visual creativity and I hope other film makers grasp the obvious technological advances on show within this film. Any lover of Sci-fi/fantasy will love this and its a joy on the eye from start to finish. The story itself is the weakest element-but no disaster. It does come across like Pocahontas! Native Indian girl falls in love with one of the invaders etc.However, one plus point of having a simple story is you can focus on the visuals on show and having time to learn the ways of the Navi inhabitants along with the hero, \"Jake Sully\", gives you that experience. The 3D is very good and does add to the spectacle. Cameron has fallen back on some old ideas from Aliens;- such as the Amp-suits matching the loaders on board the U.S.S. Solaco, the mercenary forces/equipment that mirrors that of the Colonial Marines, the gutless corporate scum-bag embodied by \"Selfridge\" is a doppelganger for Aliens \"Burke\". I strongly recommend a viewing and cannot wait for the chance to see it at an IMAX theatre-and to have a good rummage through the Bluray when its available.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">OK, so not too many movies deserve a 1 rating, and neither does this one. But I have to do something to keep this from staying in the top 250. Judging by how high up it is already, I'm fighting a losing battle. But still, if anyone watched the same movie as me and is over the age of 12 this movie would not be close to the ranking it holds. Here's why: Weak plot-How many times do we have to see the \"noble\" average man try to do something meaningful with his life and wind up falling in love with nature? *Yawn* The whole thing is beyond cliché and too predictable to even hope that something will surprise you. The main bad guy is a jacked up cartoon villain while while the others are just plain looking soldiers. You knew what he was going to do the second he walked on the screen. *Yawn* You've also got floating mountains, a fake mineral called ubotonium or something like that, and giant blue cats who worship (ready?) A tree that omits floating white jellyfish. Whoa...<br/><br/>Bad writing-The writing was almost as bad as the GI Joe movie. I felt like I was watching the Power Rangers. Whether the acting was decent or not is lost because of the weak dialog. Nobody really had anything to work with, but what can you expect from a blockbuster action flick? I'm no fool. I know James Cameron saw an opportunity to make some easy money and he took it. And it worked. Records are being broke as I type. But he cashed in on technology that he knew people would gobble up. He sloppily threw together multiple cliché elements of other similar movies, made them fluorescent and 3D, and stretched it to 2 1/2 hours to make it seem epic. If this was M. Night whatshisface I wouldn't care as much. But James Cameron c'mon. Take this movie out of 3D (why people care about that I still have no idea, the 3D shades make the movie too dark) and you've got fantasy dribble that holds no water, makes no logical sense, and can't hold a candle to the Lord of The Rings series.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">As a film, you might dislike Avatar. As an experience, it's the best of the decade. Cameron had a lot to live up to as people placed Avatar alongside Titanic, Terminator 2, and Aliens years before Avatar was released. \"He delivered\" is a huge understatement. The film looks gorgeous. This is due to the technology, but even more to the outstanding CGI work and Cameron's direction of every scene. The suddle 3D creates a more lively world of Pandora. The creatures, the Avatars and the 2154 gadgets are highly imaginative. It is impressive how Cameron was able to humanize these tall bluish creatures and makes the viewers feel anguish as terribly sad events happen them. My legs had a mind of their own at times during Avatar's exhilarating action scenes. What absolutely blew me away however are the affectionate romance scenes between Jake and Neytiri. Neytiri is an outstanding female warrior character that will stick in the minds of many. Her heart and love for her tribe sometimes makes her uncontrollably emotional and those scenes in Avatar are particularly spectacular. What Avatar lacked in a simplistic plot was filled by passionate scenes throughout, similarities of problems seen in today's society and the depiction of those problems seen through Avatar. Avatar's innovation is equivalent to how Psycho/Star Wars/Matrix/Lord of the Rings changed cinema. Cameron not only created a revolutionary experience that should not be missed, but also created a new culture, language, customs and race. Avatar will be remembered as the film that created the experience.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar. This is a title that will remain recognized and remembered for a long time to come. Tens of millions of people have already seen the movie and it is on track to become the highest grossing of all time. Congratulations to James Cameron for following his dream. After years of work (Cameron didn't write or direct anything meaningful since Titanic in 1997) and hundreds of millions of dollars spent, audiences- thankfully- are spellbound.<br/><br/>The movie, set in 2154, begins with a narration by Sam Worthington and shows his character, Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, taking his deceased twin brother's place in the Avatar program, a secret mission designed to infiltrate the world of the Na'vi, a colony of blue creatures who live on the distant moon Pandora. The exploration and exploitation of Pandora is crucial to the humans as the Na'vi tribe is living on top of an enormous amount of extremely precious, and expensive, ore.<br/><br/>Jake is not trained for this mission but since he is a genetic match to his brother, is sent anyway. His wayward actions get him into trouble relatively fast, especially since on Pandora, with his new Avatar body, he is able to run and use his legs which on Earth are paralyzed. As he is experimenting with his newfound freedom he meets the beautiful Neytiri, played by Zoe Saldana, a Na'vi huntress who shows him around and introduces him to the rest of the tribe as well as their culture, language and habits. As I'm sure you can imagine, a love story ensues and Jake's loyalty shifts rather quickly from his own race to that of the blue Na'vi's.<br/><br/>Pandora is magical. The jungle is lush and rich, teeming with life. Sights, sounds, and smells abound. There is an understanding between the people and the land, a harmony, a balance which is not exploited for profit as it is on Earth. Trees, plants, animals and the Na'vi coexist in peace and utmost respect. Trees are considered to have souls and nothing can be harmed, touched or disturbed. Each and every life, be it human, animal or plant is valued equally. This is no doubt alluring to us all, as we watch our own planet suffer from the ravages of our growth and absorb the great damages of our years of neglect.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver plays a tough talking scientist, unlikeable at first (she is even shown smoking cigarettes which has caused great controversy) but her true character unfolds and is revealed throughout the movie. She has a purpose and a mission, fighting against the capitalist exploiters from Earth who are trying to ruin Pandora and expel or kill the Na'vi peoples. Stunningly beautiful moments (some of my favorites were the spectacular scenes with the flying dragons) are mixed in with scenes of utmost destruction and devastation that leave you extremely saddened and horrified at what we are capable of. I have read that some theatergoers are leaving the movie with serious depression issues, wanting to leave our world to live on a planet like Pandora.<br/><br/>The story is simple, perhaps too simple, and themes like these have already been seen, but the movie is enchanting and the technical achievements and cinematography outstanding. The special effects are hard to put in words, they must be seen and experienced in 3D. This movie deserves a lot of the praise it is getting and is therefore a must-see. Personally I'm happy I saw it and although I wouldn't see it twice, can recognize its triumph. If it is seen as such it will be an enjoyable experience and it will be understandable why Cameron waited so long to come up with his next billion dollar blockbuster.<br/><br/>My rating: 7 Fabio's: 6.5 Total Score: 13.5 For more reviews please visit and become a follower at: http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I love westerns, I love sci-fi, but as a student of history and film, I've seen this before. Yes, the technology is mind-blowing, the film is entertaining to say the least, but the story is a blatant rip-off of the history of the Indian Wars and the Custer saga of the last half of the 19th Century with a little of Dances With Wolves thrown in to make it more palatable.<br/><br/>This time around, rather than gold, humans find an extremely rare and powerful element on the planet Pandora already populated with a native life-form called the Navi. They proceed to try to peacefully move the inhabitants out of the area, all the while preparing for war, if necessary. The avatar program is nothing more than a revamped Indian agent/missionary program trying to educate and relocate. If not blue and ten feet tall, the Navi would be American Indians riding astride their six-legged horses and their dragons or mythical thunderbirds.<br/><br/>The story alludes to previous encounters with the Navi that might parallel the Sand Creek massacre, the destruction of their giant tree village might as well be the battle at Washita, and the final great battle that sees the destruction and death of most of the human forces is certainly their Pandoran Little Big Horn.<br/><br/>The Navi, whose name sounds Indian, fight with bows and arrows, ride into battle on their horses and dragons screaming war whoops and cries that come right from every Indian battle on film, and they share a bond with nature much like the mythical Indian of American lore. The chief of the Navi is even played by Wes Studi with a computerized distinctly American Indian face.<br/><br/>Once the humans have been defeated and sent packing at the end, Pandora is left peaceful and tranquil once again. Really? If history repeats itself, as it so often does, the humans will be back one hundred times stronger, wear the Navi down by shear numbers and decimate them and get what they want anyway. The happy ending of the film is a joke if reality pokes in its ugly head.<br/><br/>Technically it's great film making, but it's a rehash of history and previous movies with nothing new to add to the storytelling.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Especially once I had seen it, for myself, I was able to understand that the allegation of racism is completely ridiculous, as I understand this allegation/criticism made against this film. I do think that some of the characters in the film, specifically the Colonel, definitively, &amp; Parker, probably, are at least bigoted in a way that borrows rather heavily from the racism inflicted upon the 500 Nations people of the Americas; but, that doesn't really make the characters racist, such as &amp; specifically, in the way that those who inflicted the racism, of Manifest Destiny, etc., were onto the people of the 500 Nations. Yes, there's a similarity there; but, it's not the same thing. Although, a definitive argument against this is when the Colonel asks...\"Hey, Sully, how's it feels to betray your own race?\" On the whole, the bigotry is about speciesism...not racism. So, maybe the Colonel is a racist apart from what it is actually about for the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Another important difference is that this film uses a corporatist justification for the bigotry, theft and murder of &amp; from the Na'vi. The bigotry, which was undeniably racism, inflicted upon the 500 Nations people was predominantly Manifest Destiny, which was a religious - Christian fundamentalist - justification for the rape, murder &amp; theft of &amp; from the 500 Nations people. Yea, maybe it is splitting hairs to say that this one is racist &amp; that one isn't, when the differences, religion, species not race, are relatively meaningless when you really look at it. But, even if the bad guys are racist in this film, at least it's the bad guys that are racist &amp; not the good guys and not the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Probably the biggest flaw about this film is that there is no attempt on the part of the characters to make a thoughtful examination and comparison with &amp; between what is being done to the Na'vi, in this story, &amp; what was done to the 500 Nations people, in reality, &amp; if that also had been a part of this story. If that conversation had taken place within the dialogue &amp; between the characters during this film I think that while the film may still have received some criticism, specifically from bigots, it would have received praise, overall, for tackling the subject.</div>,\n",

I spent months on a forum before that. Incremental stops included a scriptment, stills, a teaser, a foot, AVATAR day and a full trailer. Now released I have had many reviews to read which have been mostly very positive. <br/><br/>It is a marvel to watch. The opening scenes are very sci-fi with a glimpse of low gravity aboard a space-craft. Sam Worthington fills us in with a short narration. He is taking over his diseased brother's role in the AVATAR program. These opening scenes are actually among the most effective 3D in the film, pulling you into this story, tracking shots putting you into the steps of the characters. <br/><br/>I jump ahead, like the film, to The world of Pandora which is lush with earthly life as seen through pulp fantasies. The rendering of this world is terrific. The life and activity is in the plants as much as it is the animals. Wonder is generated with this ambitious creation. Cameron has lifted the bar. The CG is the best I have ever seen. Everything you have heard is true. The 3D enhances this with leaves falling and swaying branches life-like in the foreground. <br/><br/>The realisation of the Navii is also ambitious. They are CG but there are many moments that make you think they are real and in terms of the story they are more than good enough to propel the narrative with strong emotional content. <br/><br/>I went into this film knowing mostly everything within it. Hours of reading, some from the treatment and pages of the recent reviews. It is very much a family film like \"Nealz\" said in his IMDb review. There is a moment where one of the ferocious animal species that earlier were attacking Jake are seen with a litter, the children in the audience loved the cute pups! The spiritual side of this film is much better than expected. It is in fact a beautiful story. The structure is classical film-making but with amazingly new scope in CGI to express grand images. An epic <br/><br/>The journey that Jake takes through Pandora is lovely. He is taken in by the Navii and explores their culture, language and habitat. Natirii, the female Navii he meets while lost, helps him through this journey. This is a love story of both soul mates and with a wider picture. Existential connections with the natural world. Personal destiny. <br/><br/>I had tears in this film. I tried to hold them back but by the roll of credits they came. This is a movie that I have anticipated for so long. I think the ingredients of its story and my connection to this films production gave me a very emotional response. I cant imagine this disappointing any of the fans on the board. Keeping in mind that it is a family film but delivered everything I wanted. <br/><br/>Expect a special edition. After AVATAR is a hit, a special edition will make its way to the cinema. I can understand why they would cut the earth scenes and it works. The actual film seems pretty brisk and it could also have more padding out. You want more of it and that is a triumph for this type of film running two and a half hours. It is a good balance because at two and a half hours AVATAR is aimed directly at the cinema going audience. Broadly appealing with elements for everyone. My earlier prediction of a billion or more world-wide seems safe. <br/><br/>I don't want to go on about visuals too much but the lovely shots of the natural wonderland of glowing life in still 3D shots is magical. Something to take kids to see. Floating tiny neon li<br/><br/>fe jellyfish their way through the air with grace. The monkey-like extra-limbed creatures with the peeping eyes flock through the forrest quickly. The creature design is done in a clever way with the motion of a living thing. The action is over the top, epic, frenetic and a new take on the battle sequence. <br/><br/>James Cameron didn't stuff this up. He probably pressed the studio way beyond their comfort zone with the time, money and effort that has gone into this. Sam Worthington is excellent casting choice. Sigourney Weaver ads frank reason. Stephen Lang chews the scenery as the ultimate you know what. Zoe Saldana is beautiful as Jakes guide into this world and. <br/><br/>I went to the cinema and it was a very hot day. By the time I left the cinema, the streets were wet with rain. A warm humidity was thick in the air. Lightning splashed my walk to the train station with white light. I honestly wondered if It was my time to be struck down with a bolt of electricity from the sky. <br/><br/>Watch this film. It is destined to become a childhood classic to many little-ones too young to be on this forum. It will be talked about at high school by male and females as spectacular. It will be watched multiple times by fans. I loved it but beyond my appreciation for the film itself, is the the message of love permeating from this movie that I hope enters the zeitgeist like elements of Cameron's other stories have. At its heart is a soul. AVATAR is an achievement in many technical departments but I wouldn't say the story is deficient. It is a beautiful experience and the story is surprisingly what I loved most. <br/><br/>Believe the hype.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Christmas this year came to us with a lavish bonanza in the form of 'Avatar'.<br/><br/>James Cameron once again proved that if you have enough funds and imagination there is no limit to creativity. This movie truly has raised the bar of vision for the future cohort movies.<br/><br/>Avatar deals with a story which we have seen in many forms; the only thing which makes this film so inimitable, is because of its ground breaking way of staging visual effects which is just spectacular to gaze at. Though the narrative had been quite conventional the presence of 3D as the medium for transmission enhanced the involvement further more.<br/><br/>In short, the story takes us to year 2154 on a moon called as Pandora. Here humans are involved for mining valued mineral known as unobtanium. This intrusion threats the way of life of an indigenous humanoid population called Na'vi. 'Avatar' deals with the forename of the project which centers bio engineering Na'vi bodies which could be remotely controlled by humans in order to interact with the native inhabitants. The plot centers a paralyzed marine who knowingly volunteers for Avatar project, falls in love with a female na'vi and later questions his loyalty towards humans.<br/><br/>On personal front I never felt the story to be difficult to get on with; it simply could have been much more, if we had an opportunity to see some more character development. This is the reason for which I had reconsidered my rating.<br/><br/>'Avatar' brings along some impressive cast like Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Stephen Lang and legendary Sigourney Weaver. Saldana's role as Neytiri is really exemplary which made us to stop think that we were actually watching photo realistic computer generated characters.<br/><br/>Cameron's ingenuity can be seen through the vast life form he created for his fictional Pandora. This film shows us what to anticipate in future motion capture animation technology.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a must watch in 3D in order to value its credibility. This would definitely be falling under the scanner of the Academy Awards\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Honestly, I lost my faith in Cameron when he made Titanic. Avatar looks to put the final nail in his coffin. When I saw the preview I knew it would be a PC propaganda piece for eco-guilt and left-wing politics. I also knew there was no hope in seeing the dorky looking Alien Smurfs with their suck caveman weapons get wiped out. Now that would be a movie worth seeing! Sorry but I cannot root against the human race (especially with all the cool military tech), call me biased.<br/><br/>The whole idea of some primitive alien race using nonsensical fantasty inspired creatures that look like pet dragons to defeat a high-tech army is the pinnacle of stupidity. It is like some teenage boy lacking testosterone came up with the plot. Lets see, lets combine fern gully and the smurfs for the good guys and lets make the bad guys \"greedy\" corporate humans hell bent on \"destroying the planet\" in their unsustainable need for energy to fuel their capitalist consumerism. The only thing that can save the planet is the primitive zen/native American/tribal beliefs in eco-harmony. Spare me the lecture on your economic illiteracy Cameron.<br/><br/>The crappy video game for this should be hilarious, especially with all the kids confused why they cannot play with the cool robo-mechs with machine guns and instead get to be \"Dorky Smurf\", decked out in loin cloth armor, armed with a biodegreadable bow and arrow! Controls will include a button for \"tree planting\", \"eco-meditation\", \"recycling your weapons\" and \"low carbon footprint\" (you walk lightly and hardly breathe).<br/><br/>What a waste of CGI. Apparently Cameron spent millions getting Smurfette's breasts \"right\". How hard is it to get them right? Just make them big! Maybe next time he can spend as much time on a real plot where you can actually root for the human race? Nah, pushing left-wing propaganda is more important than entertainment. Right Cameron? Sadly this movie will appeal to eco-pacifists who have been brainwashed that we are destroying the planet and the human race is evil.<br/><br/>Maybe because I am human I have a problem with being considered evil but hey that is just me.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron did it again after 11 years of Titanic. His new directorial venture Avatar is simply masterpiece and sets a new standard in film making. However the story is bit inspired from Pocahontas kind of situation but this has been compensated by fast paced presentation of each developments &amp; twists. I was in awe how 170 minutes passed because of crisp screenplay.<br/><br/>The visual effects are perhaps the best since Lord of the Rings. On acting side, Sam Worthington as Jack Sullivan was convincing. His positive aura and decent look worked well. He is actor to watch out. Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez were also did there job effectively.<br/><br/>The lush vegetation and ferocious animals of Pandora were breathtaking. Everything looked so real. The sound effects were also something I haven't experienced before and I liked.<br/><br/>The entire credit goes to James Camroon and only James Camroon. The film does live upto its expectation. What I liked about Avatar is that it has mass appeal. Everyone from elders to kids were enjoying and clapping in the theater.<br/><br/>Please don't miss this one in theater as big screen is better for this big venture (in terms of content and not budget).</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This film is the biggest Box Office in the whole world. It is rated highly on IMDb.<br/><br/>So this makes this film great???<br/><br/>No, this is the most boring cheesy cliché film i have seen.<br/><br/>The actors are not very good, not interesting, sigourney weaver is poor. The plot and the story are weak and very basic<br/><br/>You have a good disabled marine changing sides to the blue aliens to defend them against a bad general who wants their tree of life down so he can carry out development.<br/><br/>It is not original there are no surprises or twists, it needed a director to make the characters intense and plot interesting.<br/><br/>This movie is just a beautiful visual 3D film, but when you look deep in the film there is nothing there An excellent movie is Pulp Fiction, Alien, God Father, Kill Bill because these movies have great characters and a really good gripping story.<br/><br/>Avatar fails to keep me awake, i knew the ending before it happened and was disappointed<br/><br/>All that glitters is not gold!<br/><br/>i give this 1 star, like watching paint dry</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've talked to several people and told them this, and they all argued at first until I drew the parallels for them. Afterward they all had to agree Avatar is Dances With Wolves on an alien planet. It's not a bad film, but coming from James Cameron it felt like a lazy effort except for the visual effects.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is not a sci-fi masterpiece, but it is a good film. Several marines are sent to Pandora to discover the whereabouts of a precious mineral. Jake Sully is one of those marines. While being transferred into the mind of his avatar, he meets an alluring alien named Neytiri. The two fall in love and later endure conflict, mating, and the ways of her colony. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana give solid performances and have great chemistry as Sully and Neytiri, respectively. The story is clichéd, but it is executed so well that it is able to draw you in for most of its running time. The final action sequence is enthralling and tense, the way an action sequence should be. James Cameron proves to be an amazing director; it is very difficult to make a film as complex and visually captivating as this. Despite its over-length, Avatar is a gripping, surprising, and genuinely romantic sci-fi film. It isn't the best picture of 2009, but it certainly is one of the best. These visuals will inspire other filmmakers for ideas in the future.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Before seeing this film I knew virtually nothing about it. For the last couple of years I sporadically heard about Cameron and \"Avatar\".. But nothing specific. The only thing I did know was that this movie was gonna be in 3D and that it cost roughly half a billion $.<br/><br/>With that in mind I reserved my seat a couple of days ago. Even though it was the 2 pm showing there was already a large crowd gathered at the movie theater. When I finally came to the counter I was asked to pay 12 ($17)instead of 11 indicated on the reservation form. Another  was charged as a \"3 D Handling Fee\". Just to compare \"2012\" which was of similar length cost me 9,6 ($13,70).. <br/><br/>Actually I wasn't mad after all that.. I just thought that after all the hype and the money I just paid this better be good.. <br/><br/>The movie didn't waste a lot of time and jumped immediately into the story. Our hero \"Jake Scully\" is a crippled war veteran who was approached by some gentlemen and given a job offer since his identical brother died and they've already created an Avatar suitable to his (or rather his brothers) DNA. He awakens after a 6 year cryo sleep and lands on the planet. His brother was a trained PhD who was well suited for the mission. The mission being that this planet is inhabited by a race who is about 3 times the size of humans and co-exists with it's environment (an ability we sometimes lack).. The Teamleader, who is played by Sigorney Weaver is at first not happy about this but then again, they have this avatar ready to be used. So what is an avatar? An avatar is a artificially created entity, which in appearance looks like a local inhabitant of this planet and can be completely controlled by the human it was made for. Why do we have those? Simple, since the indigenous people of this planet are rather hostile when it comes to outsiders, it was thought that it might be a great Idea if we can be made to look like them. Why all the effort? Because they inhabit a part of the planet where directly under them is a large quantity of an immensely valuable substance. And nice people that we are, we first try to get rid of them with peaceful means.. But back to the story. On his first mission Jake get's separated from his colleagues and meets one of the locals, a female of course.. Well, I don't wanna spoil too much but they become great friend and he learns the ways of these people. I forgot their name because it wasn't really important..<br/><br/>What is the most important thing about this movie is that you forget pretty fast that you are watching a movie. You are inside these big forests who look nothing like forests here on earth because everything is illuminated and just looks magical.. The plot, while pretty slim, is rather engaging and you really want to know how it's gonna end..<br/><br/>Effects wise .. Hmm this is so hard because this movie feels more like a dream after you are finished. You see so many incredible things in that movie. During the movie I turned to my girlfriend and said \"I can't believe this movie cost ONLY half a billion\".. And I wasn't joking.. What you will see in this movie is unlike anything you have seen before and since it's so unique if you don't watch it you'll probably never see it again. Also, don't wait for the Blu Ray, because the 3D Effect employed was so great and is not doable on BD. You get Glasses from the Movie Theater but they are just slightly tinted.. Not red and Green like the cheapo ones you get with a 3D Movie you'll watch at home.. Well I tried to give you the main points of the plot.. But beyond that it's really rather difficult to explain.. It's even more revolutionary than T2 was in '91.. So if you have any love for movies at all, Go and watch \"Avatar\"!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The blu-ray has been lying here for centuries without play since the player did not accept the discs despite updates ( not the only on the planet with this problem , thank you Fox ), so new player and finally seen this movie. Impressed ? no . Characters: couldn't care less. Story : seen before, no twists , predictable. Action : mediocre . Romance : predictable. Special effects : didn't blow my shoes of , but nothing wrong here. All in all , nothing special and not worth the hype. If anything is good : its better than that crap movie Prometheus. It seems nowadays that some directors are more occupied with the visuals than the contents and as such need retirement big time.</div>,\n",

       " i really like their world</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I really disliked this film. The plot is terrible and seems like a weird mix of pocahontas and the smurfs. This film is supposed to be a technological achievement of CGI. I believe the people who thinks that are unaware of what was done in videogaming at the same time. The only thing Cameron did put these technology to film with a budget 10 times as big as a video game company would have needed to do the same thing.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">When I think of Avatar I rarely remember it for its descent story but for its incredible world building. I remember seeing this film in Imax 3D when the film released and being captivated to this breathtaking world. The world of Pandora leaves audiences speechless with a world so filled of beautiful scenery and brand new life. In the near future I hope Disney releases a 4K version of the film and that Avatar 2 is just as immersive as the 2009 original. Hopefully the 12 year wait for a sequel will be worth it</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The effect of watching Avatar in 3D is absolutely mesmerising...the world that Cameron creates is quite extraordinary...the special effects quite revolutionary. You can't help but be blown away by it.<br/><br/>For all its technological superiority, the story is quite uninspiring and commonplace (I like the fact that humans are the bad guys rather than the aliens). When one saw Star Wars, what one is left with is not only the special effects and movie-making skill of Lucas but the dramatic elements of the movie. That's why its stays and will remain a classic for time to come. Many movies have broken technological boundaries but they will always be bested by something else more memorable. So Avatar will become another such movie which people will be amazed about for a while until the next bigger and newer movie comes around...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron's Avatar is an endeavor of titanic proportions, no pun intended. It took upwards of 12 years and a budget larger than that of some third world nations to come to fruition. So... Was it worth it? Well, first of all, the script is lackluster. The plot is standard and predictable, the characters are cookie-cutter at best, overblown caricatures at worst. With a none-too-subtle message about the evils of technology encroaching on the natural balance.<br/><br/>This was the part of the movie that didn't sit well with me. I'm the first to admit that the human race is full of arrogant jerks, but I'd like to think we've progressed as a species to the point where we wouldn't be willing and in fact blatantly eager to drive an indigenous people to extinction for our own financial gain. Maybe I'm wrong...<br/><br/>But the message of this film seems to be, \"People are stubborn, greedy, ignorant, and violent creatures.\" That constant message bothered me a lot, as did the characters who reinforced it. They're not just stupid humans. They're not just evil humans. Their adamantly uncaring and violent attitudes are physically abrasive. And there's few things I hate more than abrasive characters. I know enough irritating people in real life, without having to pay to see more.<br/><br/>And then we have characters like Colonel Quaritch, who's not only evil and abrasively irritating, but almost totally devoid of motivation. Like Richard III, he is determined to prove a villain, and continues to be ruthlessly, sadistically antagonistic without any real reason, or at least not a good one. Unlike Richard III, he's not at all fun to watch. He's not so much a character as a personification of the Evil, Technology-Wielding Humans that the film seeks to vilify.<br/><br/>On the other hand... The story may be lacking, the characters may be irritating, but the visual effects are stunning. The animators manage to create flora, fauna, and general topography for a completely alien world. The colors are vibrant, the details are exquisite. It's a unique and fascinating experience, incredible to look at.<br/><br/>But then again, so was the movie Hero. And that one had a terrific script too.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">First I didn't want to go watch Avatar because when I heard Cameron took 3 weeks to write the plot I said to myself there is no hope for cinema anymore. And somehow people are showing me that I was right. I went to watch this piece of .... because I have been told it s unbelievable.<br/><br/>Storywise, there is no story at all. It's the typical good vs bad scenario shaped out of cowboys against indians in space mixing it with a yogi everything connects us to the world impression plus a goddamn planet called Pandora and looks like f...in' paradise. Lot's of shiny colours and huge monsters who eat flesh are your best friends. Come on. You gotta be kidding me.<br/><br/>Maybe I might be the only one here, cause all reviews I've seen got great score, but that is not what a movie is supposed to be. I was very unimpressed by the CGI and the artistic development because I might be used to computer games such as Final Fantasy series which has been the shaper of such incredible stories, only that these games have a very strong story to tell and and you feel totally involved.<br/><br/>It impresses me that people give this such a high rating because of it's visuals. I mean it was clear that sooner or later a movie would appear with such incredible CGI. If it wouldn't have been Avatar another would have been the winner.<br/><br/>I am sad that nowadays cinema is ail centered only about violence, good looks and a huge lack of brain.<br/><br/>3 out of ten only for the cgi which I thought is not the center of a movie otherwise I would have rated it beneath 0.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It's very possible that this is an important movie in the field of CGI and 3D technology. In that category it is certainly a groundbreaking pioneer and it will have its followers. In fact it already has (life of Pi). The artificial world that was created was amazingly beautiful and imaginative. <br/><br/>For this I give the movie all ten points.<br/><br/>But in the movie industry there are different categories. More than half of the playing time - namely the scenes of the Avatar world - belonged more or less to the category of animated movies with CGI effects. It was made rather on the computer than it was behind the camera.<br/><br/>The question is: shouldn't Avatar be treated and rated like an animated movie rather than a motion picture with real actors? Even animated movies and are judged as whole, not only for their outstanding visual execution.<br/><br/>If you extract the whole high tech visual aspect of Avatar what is left of it?<br/><br/>-average acting (except Sigurney Weaver) (- 1 point) <br/><br/>-predictable story (- 1 point) <br/><br/>-full of clichés: bad military people versus native peoples preserving nature (-1 point) <br/><br/>-full of stereotypes: there are either good or bad characters (-1 point)<br/><br/>If the Avatar world would have been replaced (and played) by some real Aborigines, this movie would have been neither noticed nor watched.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that this movie is the equivalent for pop music hits: Today for the best tomorrow for the garbage.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've avoided this movie for a couple of years because, given what I've heard, there was not much to expect from the story, although the graphics were spectacular. Finally watched it, and indeed, the graphics are impressive. Still a touch on the cartoony side to my eye, but nevertheless, visually arresting.<br/><br/>But even though I was prepared for a sophomoric plot, I found it hard to stomach this. With some people it will resound. With the people who despise their own culture, the people who loathe being part of a society that grants power to fools with their votes and consumer dollars, they will really connect with this film. It will also help if they know nothing of anthropology, have a one sided view of history taken straight from a Zinn book, and have never spent more than twenty seconds learning about ecology. <br/><br/>And that's fine. There have been more ridiculous stories told, although none more hyped. What personally chaffed me was the portrayal of the military. The film had to have bad guys, I know, but good Lord. I'm biased, I know, but really, I have to mention that it's a parody of real people that would be offensive if it was worth taking seriously. I have overly strong opinions sometimes, I know, but did Cameron have to spend over 300 million to tell a story this vapid? I could go on about how unlikely everything about the last fight scene is from a strategic perspective, or I could point out how culturally horrifying it is that the main character screwed up an important arranged marriage because of his frickin' feelings, but Hollywood makes its bread and butter insisting that love and an aversion to technological progress are sentiments to be overvalued at every turn. It's not surprising, but the reception it has received from people still disturbs me. I want this country to be more environmentally responsible, but I'm still thankful that the 'message' here has been forgotten already.<br/><br/>This gets 5 stars from me, on the basis of its graphics, and on the fact that the acting is good by genre standards. The cast did well, and as a director, I have no less respect for Cameron's skill. I just don't care what he has to say, and this film needed far more originality to make up for how absurd much of it really was.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">For all its visual proficiency, \"Avatar\" is not the apex of cinematic achievement some reviewers would have you believe it is, and the primary reason is this: the wobbly script is about as old as cinema itself -- the abundance of flat dialogue like \"You're not the only one with a gun, bitch\" doesn't help either. For this reason (and others discussed below) I still rank Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy as superior to \"Avatar\" -- Cameron's film may be technologically superior, but it lacks the intelligence and subtle emotion of Jackson's expertly crafted cinematic trio.<br/><br/>\"Avatar\" is filled with familiar characters, from the rebellious outsider and hero Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) to noble human scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) to a cartoonish villain (Stephen Lang) invoking the imperialist bloodlust of Bush Cheney Co. to the wise and peaceful Na'vi chief (Wes Studi) and shaman (C.C.H. Pounder) who happen to be parents to the Na'vi princess, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).<br/><br/>Neytiri is the sole standout among the film's characterizations as aspiring to something more than cliché: she is not cast simply as Jake's mandatory love interest or the raison d'etre for the switching of his loyalties. She is a fierce warrior, a defender of the environment, and a potent force of nature whose love and life are at the center of the film. The film makers spared no effort in crafting her as authentically as possible; there are moments (i.e. the destruction of the Great Tree, her animalistic cries over the body of her father) when she seems more real (even more human?) than the human characters, which is testimony to the fact that she is the greatest technological achievement in a film boasting of literally millions of special effects and synthetic manipulations. Indeed, when all else about the film may be forgotten, it is her image which persists in the memory, so powerfully is she depicted.<br/><br/>It is difficult to watch the onslaught of attacks on the Na'vi without thinking of how closely this scene of unadulterated horror and depraved violence resembles what the people of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam have endured throughout the U.S. led invasions of those nations. It is clear that Cameron views those invasions as immoral and evil. Should there be any doubts, he has his villain proclaim his desire for \"preemptive attack\" by fighting \"terror with terror.\" I wonder what arch conservative Rupert Murdoch (whose Fox produced \"Avatar\") thinks of this not-so-subtle bit of Bush bashing . . .<br/><br/>It is impossible -- yes, impossible -- to view the film without thinking of real, historical, flesh and blood Native Americans who lived in North America long before Jamestown was ever a colony. The Na'vi of Pandora are the Native Americans of the 16th and 17th centuries, complete from their tribal lifestyle to the markings on their bodies.<br/><br/>To be sure, there is much in \"Avatar\" that borrows from earlier films about Native Americans, namely Disney's animated musical \"Pocahontas\" and the Kevin Costner epic \"Dances with Wolves\". Neytiri IS Pocahontas, and if Jake isn't John Smith, he is most definitely John J. Dunbar/Dances With Wolves. The dominant themes of environmental oneness, natural spirits, and kinship with all of creation abound in stark contrast with the \"human\" values of greed, war, and destruction. Cameron even managed to reincarnate Grandmother Willow as a divine tree called Eywah.<br/><br/>The film also delves into the issues of race, genocide, and manifest destiny (admittedly, not always with subtlety or sophistication) in ways that many will decry the film as blatant anti-American propaganda, or as some have described it, as a liberal apology for genocide inflicted upon the indigenous peoples of the Americas by Europeans fueled by white guilt and a visceral hatred of all things neocon. Clearly, much more unfolds on the screen than simply the greatest collection of cinematic visuals you've ever seen.<br/><br/>Thus the question naturally arises, is this the definitive mainstream Hollywood film about Native Americans and what they endured under siege of the settlers in the founding years of America? The truth is I do not know. But if what is essentially a popcorn blockbuster can encourage the average film-goer to reassess how they view their place in the natural world and what it really means to invade another nation and unleash war, then Cameron will have far exceeded his goals. What I do know is that \"Avatar\" is an AMAZING piece of entertainment (cheesy dialogue, superficial characterizations and all). You've never seen anything like it -- and likely won't for a long, long time. A definite must-see.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The first thing I ever heard about Avatar was it was amazing, a must see, the greatest movie ever made. Well, the first thing I heard was wrong. The movie had loads of entrancing visuals with fine acting, generic characters, a lacking script and an already old, recycled, generic and plain unoriginal storyline.<br/><br/>The first thing I mentioned was the visuals, which were as stunning as you've heard. The gigantic budget for this surely must have added something to this awesome spectacle. After watching the movie I felt like the only redeeming quality was the visuals which is why I gave the movie a 4.<br/><br/>Second, the acting. The acting was passable. Just like the acting in Transformers, I wouldn't go into this movie expecting Oscar-caliber acting. Sigourney Weaver was the high point considering most of the acting was by the CGI it just wasn't impressive. When all your acting is done by animators it's hard not to notice the lack of acting the movie has.<br/><br/>Third, generic characters. Most James Cameron movies have characters that are interesting and more than one dimensional these are a bit of a let-down. You have complete cardboard cut-out type characters that don't seem to have any layers besides good-guy and bad-guy. No character is a wild card like Han Solo or Hannibal Lecter. These characters were not simply a one or two word definition these characters were complex and had conflicts and such. But not so with the characters in here.<br/><br/>Fourth, a lacking script. Cheap dialogue. While dialogue isn't everything it certainly is nice to have great dialogue such as Dr. Strangelove. The dialogue is a bit generic and unoriginal.<br/><br/>The blow that kills the movie more than any of its wounds. The awful storyline. While not only ripping off every movie pro-environment it doesn't change anything. It should be title Dances with Wolves 2: Blue Space Indians. The Näví are just blue Native Americans with less clothing. Starting with the white guy who is coming to a new place and is shown the ropes. He gets accepted into the tribe of whatever and realizes the other white people are bad people and he must help the tribe because white people don't listen to anybody but themselves. White people=bad except for the random white guy in the crowd who helped them out. Also, the one girl who is a little sketchy of the white guy at first ends up falling in love with him stupid clichè. The end is some stupid battle where white people with technology get killed by the tribe using bows and arrows and rocks. Yep, that's totally original it doesn't sound like any other movie I've ever seen (sarcasm). Dances with Wolves was a far better movie than this pro-environmental trash. <br/><br/>In recap, this movie is completely bland tasting but has a delicious feast for the eyes. Good special effects don't make a movie. Look at Transformers 1, 2 or 3.An intriguing plot, good characters and good acting make a great movie. For stunning visuals and these other qualities I'd suggest Life of Pi, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Pacific Rim (acting was again passable in Pacific Rim's case). Avatar was a complete let down and completely unoriginal.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">With over 1,500 reviews already posted I feel like this is on the order of a drop in the ocean, but here goes:<br/><br/>Back in the summer of 1977 we were driving around one evening and happened to see a marquee for a movie called Star Wars. Prior to seeing that marquee we had not heard a single thing about the film, but having nothing better to do that night, we decided what the heck - we'd give it a shot. When we left the theater that evening I knew I had just seen a very special film - the special effects represented a quantum leap ahead from anything previously brought to the screen and I felt certain that we had just turned a page in movie making.<br/><br/>Tonight I had the same feeling leaving Avatar. The crafting of the film is simply outstanding and I think it will become a milestone similar to Star Wars. We will return to see it again in 3D, as tonight's viewing was a 2D showing.<br/><br/>Given that high praise, why did we not rate it higher? In one word: plot. It is beyond sad that a film with such superb special effects and with so much thought and imagination being poured into the creation of an alien world and all the fanciful and fantastic critters inhabiting that world we couldn't have been offered some sort of plot that hasn't already been flogged to death by a gazillion other films. Yes, I will admit that the cautionary tale represented here (our universal human tendency to justify atrocity towards others by convincing ourselves that they are less than human) cannot be told often enough, but is it too much to hope that a movie so groundbreaking in so many ways might at least try to surprise us with a groundbreaking plot line? I guess it is.<br/><br/>Even so, the beauty and imagination (other than plot) here is overwhelming - and more than enough to recommend the film. I'm sort of looking forward to seeing the books on the biology, zoology and geography of Pandora. If they're not out yet I'm sure they will be soon.<br/><br/>One last note: even if we were tempted to rate this film a ten, it would have lost at least a point for two particularly irritating things: (1) Unobtainium. This is something straight out of The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (remember Upsidaisium?) In a cartoon series that's all about satire, bad puns and silliness it's a laugh. In a movie that wants you to take anything it has to say even the least bit seriously, it's an insult. The use of it here hints that the scriptwriter may not hold his audience in very high regard. (2) The impossibly buff, impossibly slender design of the Navi, which we think could only derive from the unhealthy and unattainable obsessions of contemporary American culture. We'll toss a quarter of a point back in as a thank you for at least not equipping the Navi females with humongous breasts.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I finally got a chance to see Avatar today after several failed attempts due to snow, crowds, theaters only showing it in 2D etc. Below are my impressions which assume you already know the story and maybe have formed your own opinions already.<br/><br/>First of all, I agree with everyone that complains about the lack of dialog and the predictable story. I remember when Titanic first came out and people were complaining back THEN about how insipid was the script and Jack's character, etc. Well, Jack Dawson was much better fleshed out as a character than Jake Sully! I mean, it seems our standards for dialog have dropped another notch in the past ten years. Jake is an appealing character, and I think pretty well suited to the role. He also narrates the story a bit. But he basically is not given even a moments worth of meaningful dialog (unless you consider lines like \"count me in\" and \"teach me\" meaningful dialog) I think they could have basically scripted him as mute as well as paraplegic, and the movie would not have had any less impact. This is remarkable when you consider the deep, personal crisis he confronts midway through the film. Oh well, we must not let anything get in the way of the visuals...<br/><br/>Anyway, the story unfolds very quickly here, and we're not given much time to think about characters. I felt like I was being immersed in Pandora before I was really ready. Its always nice to build a little suspense and audience expectation up before going some place so fantastic. Unfortunately here, though, the wonders of Pandora were treated in a pretty matter of fact way, almost as if we were expected to already know a bit about it. I think it would have really been nice for Grace (Sigorney Weaver), the primary advocate for the planet, to show a little more excitement about her world and a little less jaded attitude. I mean, if Pandora was the star of this movie, it was not given the reverence it deserved by Grace. That reverence was reserved for the Na'vi, but their's was from a wholly different perspective, being that it was THEIR world and the only one they have ever known.<br/><br/>But on to the main plot here - politically, what you get with Avatar is a healthy dose of left wing morality. A VERY healthy dose. Western man rapes a planet and threatens an indigenous culture in the process. THis sad tale pits a cocky soldier thug (Stephen Lang) and military industrial complex dweeb (Giovanni Ribisi) against the Navi, a noble, indigenous tribe of Indian-like people. The princess of this tribe is Neytiri who is both strong and confident as well as sexy and emotionally fragile. Her \"West Side Story\" love affair with Jake, the reluctant warrior, is what adds personal triumph and tragedy to the story that already is designed to tug at your heartstrings quite a bit. You are suppose to cry for the Navi, and I imagine many did. Others undoubtedly saw this as blatant political propaganda and squirmed in their seat. But If you were in the latter category, it might have been best for you to just skip this little morality tale all together. This was not a military propaganda film. THe \"good guys\" - mother nature, the Na'vi, tribal values, etc triumph in the end.<br/><br/>Anyway, but superimposed on the main plot is Jake's personal story and his relationship with his Avatar. This I thought was fascinating and one of the movie's main draws apart from the visuals. I thought that what really facilitated Jake's conversion to the Navi lifestyle and his political about face was the thrill he got from having legs and mobility again. This theme of returning to ones childhood and/or to a more primitive state (but more robust physically) is a key to understanding the love interest and from there, the conversion Jake experiences. The \"love\" Jake suddenly finds himself experiencing is really a love of nature and of his youthful, more athletic self. Disabled as he was, who would not want to return to the garden of eden and be given a second chance at life? So I enjoyed this sub plot which played a key role in bridging the fantasy and the reality, the animated and the non animated characters and bringing unity to the story. <br/><br/>Well, I just remembered there is a limit on how much you can write in a review. So, on with the visuals. The visuals were stunning like I expected, but one does not get a good sense for the overall scale of it all. Were they traveling miles, hundreds of miles, or what? And, well, the floating mountains just kind of didn't really make much sense from a ecological point of view. So this lent more of a fantasy element to Pandora than one based solidly in science. And as for the plant and animal life, I preferred the plant life. The luminescence was kind of cool and made the Na'vi's lives seem mystical and enchanting. But the animals were crude and hostile by comparison (except for the \"horses\"). And they were also not well suited for the rain forest environment either. Basically, they just stuck big, fast, aggressive game animals into a thick, wet forest, which I guess is why so many of them kept running into trees...:)<br/><br/>So in conclusion, Avatar is a visually stunning, well made film but with a predictable, time honored love/war theme. Thankfully, the Avatar sub plot though is refreshing and breaths originality into the romance. But overall, maybe the best thing about Avatar was that it introduces us to a totally new world and teases us with the potential for some really great sci-fi movie-making. So we'll see what develops in the way of a sequel...</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've come to the consensus that as beautiful the world looks, there is no story that's in any way original.<br/><br/>It was hard to ignore the hype but this movie is all style and no substance, with weird and obtuse being mistaken for creativity and weird blue native American ceremonies and bonding rituals in place of character development. In the end we end up with characters we don't care much for and a generic \"humans are evil\" plot.<br/><br/>I promise I really really wanted to like it, more than anything. But sadly underneath all of the pretty CGI fx it's just like a McDonald's happy meal, cheap and bland. Highly disappointing.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It must be an age thing.<br/><br/>For over forty years I would go to the movies once perhaps twice a week; in the eighties I was seeing over one hundred films a year. Watching movies on TV, video, and even DVD/Blue Ray was no substitute for the cinema experience. But over the last few years, I have left the theatre disappointed so often that I have cut my movie going down to perhaps one picture a month.<br/><br/>And last year out came Avatar. \"The most hyped, the most praised, the most successful, the most amazing etc etc\" movie experience ever. And I knew it would not be very good. But even on my much reduced movie going schedule I dithered and thought I should really see it. But I didn't and later in the year when it came out on DVD, not buying it was no hardship.<br/><br/>But now Avatar is showing on Sky Movies, in England where I live. So we watched it. I lasted forty five minutes. Not good enough, I thought, certainly if I am going to share my views on IMDb. So I tried again. I have got to about 110 minutes; and that is all I can take.<br/><br/>Let me say right from the outset, I am in awe at the dedication, the skill and the professionalism of all the men and women who produced this film. I assume we are looking at years of the most painstaking and exacting work. But in the end you have to ask, to what effect?<br/><br/>I am not against monster movies, I can appreciate visiting \"other worlds\". I am a bit of a sci- fi buff and I certainly have had my share of liberal guilt (as befits a product of the sixties!), and, to top it all, I loved The Terminator!!<br/><br/>(I even thought Titanic was pretty fair; although to this day I have hardly met anyone who will actually own up to seeing it; strange for the hitherto biggest grosser of all time!)<br/><br/>But this! A glacial pace (even through the action sequences), a story that would make a Year 3 (2nd Grade) schoolchild's infantile ramblings on \"the environment\" seem profound and an attempt at polemic that was so dull no sane person could be even able to recall it.<br/><br/>More importantly, the story line, the dialogue, the \"acting\" (but one could only feel sorry for the actors) were so dull and plodding as to invite sleep. Only Stephen Lang had even the semblance of an actual personality. All in all there seemed to be an almost mathematical correlation between the awesomeness (is that a word?) of the film's effects and the awfulness of the story and dialogue.<br/><br/>Avatar has its critics, I know, some of whom say that the storyline is just a rehash of the Pocahontas story. But really how can they know? Did they manage to stay awake?<br/><br/>Avatar (the first 110 minutes) was totally devoid of any wit (and I am not speaking about comedy laughs). One could feel not the remotest empathy with any of the characters and sometimes I found myself actually closing my eyes in embarrassment at the leadenness of the whole thing. Sometimes with a bad movie one can find refuge in the cliché \"so bad it's good\" and discover a measure of enjoyment that was not the film maker's intention. But not in this instance; it's just bad.<br/><br/>I'll stop now (and not before time!) , because what is the point of some grumpy old man like me ranting on at what is obviously a \"masterpiece\"!!! I might as well criticise Barack Obama on The Huffington Post!<br/><br/>But you know, it's not an age thing. Bad is just bad.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Take the DNA of an alien, mix it with the DNA of a human being &amp; you get... an avatar - a genetically engineered body designed to be remotely controlled by a human being, so that they can completely immerse themselves in an alien world. Take the DNA of every science fiction/fantasy special effects film that has ever existed, mix it with a bit of the DNA of a western, a war movie, political/environmental allegory, add 300 million dollars, the best special effects teams known to man, &amp; a mad genius directing the experiment... &amp; the result is Avatar - a technically engineered masterpiece designed to completely immerse human beings in an alien world. Yes folks, the hype is real. All roads have led to this.<br/><br/>Does it change cinema forever? Yes &amp; No. Yes, it does in the same way A Trip to the Moon, King Kong, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet, 2001, Star Wars, Tron, Terminator 2, Jurassic Park, The Matrix &amp; The Lord of the Rings changed cinema. They all set the bar, &amp; in most instances invented the bar by which all that followed them would be measured. No, in the way that most of the films which immediately followed them could not reach the bar they had set by a long shot. So, rather than describing it as changing cinema forever, I'd prefer to say that Avatar is a 10 ft tall monstrous blue milestone in special effects and for film in general.<br/><br/>I couldn't even begin to imagine watching this film at home on even the best large screen, HD TV or computer monitor... which I think was part of James Cameron's goal in making this film... to bring people back to the theaters. For, it is a film that, in my opinion (and I would be willing to bet money that James Cameron thinks so too), is not intended to be viewed in anything less than the largest movie theater you can find, in the jaw droppingly beautiful 3D technology which Cameron himself developed for this film.<br/><br/>I am notoriously difficult to please when it comes to computer generated special FX. Especially CGI characters. It comes down to the question of genuinely caring about them. Do I get that feeling of nervousness for a characters' safety as they balance on the narrow ledge of a mountain where one false step might lead to their plummeting thousands of feet to their death? Do I get that feeling of tingly excitement when they master flight for the first time and majestically and heroically soar across an expansive alien landscape? Do I relate to the deep emotion of two characters falling in love? Or the pain they feel when experiencing death? Can I shed a tear for a being that is nothing more than a pixel? There has only been one other completely CGI animated character in all of film history in which the answer to these questions was yes - Lord of the Rings' Gollum. Yet, I will admit that as much as I believed in the existence of Gollum, there was still a sense of distance, moments in which my mind could not forget that he was not made of flesh. That did not occur with Avatar. Aside from two sequences I didn't care for depicting a spiritual ceremony, I never once doubted that these incredible creatures and world existed.<br/><br/>I feel that there are three reasons for this success. 1. The obvious, which is the superior talent of the FX teams who created it. 2. The setting of an alien world that appears to share some of our own DNA allows us to recognize certain familiarities in the way we expect things should look, move and operate... but it is also foreign enough that we can accept certain variations to those expectations. And 3. James Cameron has stated that part of the reason he chose to utilize 3D in the way he did was that by applying the 3D technology to this CGI world, it immerses the audience in a way that imbues the realistic depth that is missing from all previous attempts at fully CGI characters and environments.<br/><br/>Now, to step away for a moment from the technical aspects of the film... The story is more than Dances with Wolves in space, although it is definitely that. It is also directly analogous to the destruction of the Amazon rainforests, our invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, the privatization of war that has given rise to the age of military for hire such as BlackWater and lots of other 'liberal' story lines ranging from our treatment of the environment, our lustful depletion of natural resources, and general displacement of native peoples and other native species (Sigourney Weavers' character is more Gorillas in the Mist's Dian Fossey than Alien's Ripley.) <br/><br/>Avatar is far from perfect. There are some plot inconsistencies, some silly writing and acting at times bordering on camp (such as the silly name 'Unobtaineum' - the highly desired substance substituting for oil), and there are some things I personally feel would have improved the non- effects aspects of the film - such as a slightly slower pace at times... which could have allowed for more time to explore and wonder at the sights and sounds of the world, and more intimate time spent with the characters.<br/><br/>But truthfully, whatever small flaws exist in Avatar, they are dwarfed, overcome and forgotten by the magical achievements of the film as a whole. And for someone as critical as I am, that is saying a lot. Prepare yourself to see a whole slew of films try and replicate what this one has accomplished. We will most likely sit thru many poor attempts before we reach the next one that does... and by that time, we will most likely already be reaching the next important film milestone.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I saw this movie in 3D, it was the first movie I saw in 3D so I can't compare it to anything else. But I have to say in spite of the fact that I arrived late to a packed house and got a lousy seat, it was still a neat experience. there is a real effect of depth to the environments, although I wish i could say the same for the story or characters. The story has been done 1000 times before in a different setting. Outsider tries to inveterate enemy, falls in love, sees the error of his ways and becomes part of, and fights for the clan he has tried to destroy. sort of like the story of the American Indians done in many a western.<br/><br/>The acting is average, The story and script well below average. So all you are left with is some eye candy in 3D, and that keeps you entertained when the story gets dull and slow. but it is worth the price of admission, but only in 3D. Brilliant technology but not much substance</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Don't get me wrong. This was a very impressive endeavor in IMAX 3-D, with astounding special effects, a solid script and good acting, but it's like watching an ultra-expensive futuristic version of \"Dances with Wolves,\" except that the main character in \"Avatar\" pulls a \"Capt. Kirk at Starfleet Academy\" move and changes the ending so the natives win.<br/><br/>Stephen Lang is awesome as the head of security in this movie and it's nice to see him get a great role. Giovanni Ribisi is also great to watch as the corporate guy focused on the bottom line. Excellent choices.<br/><br/>There were, however, a few issues, such as: 1) Why is it no big deal to transport billions of tons of people and equipment to a planet with a non-breathable atmosphere, hostile wildlife and resistant humanoid life forms, but getting \"unparalyzed\" is a hideously expensive venture? 2) How did Sam Worthington get some of the corniest lines you've ever heard in a movie? 3) Why didn't the humans just map out their various target locations from space and use tactical nukes (or something else), thereby eliminating the need for the line-of-sight mission at the end of the movie? I almost laughed when I saw a bunch of guys trying to shove a load of explosives out the cargo bay. 4) Why is it that the avatar technology (i.e. the brain link between human and avatar) works anywhere on the planet, but auto-guidance systems, FLIRs, etc. don't? Despite all these quibbles, Cameron and crew did a fantastic job and have raised the cinematic expectations of the movie-going public.<br/><br/>8 out of 10.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">James Cameron returns and shows these wannabe rookie directors of recent times how it's done. Finally a good \"old school\" film that is worth remembering. This has been one of the weakest years in film-making that I can think of. When extremely low quality films like Transformers 2, New Moon, and Wolverine are some of the biggest hits of the year, you know something is wrong. Leave it up to Cameron to save the day with this fresh and unique cinematic experience. <br/><br/>Avatar is everything that it has been hyped to be and is nearly flawless in it's execution. Cameron, unlike Michael Bay and every other crappy director of today, actually shows just as much care in crafting a compelling and involving story as he does in delivering mind blowing visual effects and action. Cameron knows that with out a good story and characters that action is just a bunch of noise. He really knows how to invest his audience so that when the action kicks in you are on the edge of your seat in suspense. The film runs long but everything pays off in full. There is only one plot point I can think of that doesn't have a pay off but it's barely even worth mentioning. The allegory of indigenous tribal people being forced off their land by a more sophisticated race isn't a new concept but it's executed very fresh in this story. It really makes you feel guilty to be a human being as we are the true villains in this film. You cheer for the Na'vi to kick our asses in the end. Cameron definitely does a great job of sending a message. <br/><br/>The visual effects are ground breaking and are undoubtedly going to clean out the Oscars. I heard one audience member say that Avatar was \"the most beautiful film I've seen in years\". I definitely have to agree with that statement. The creatures and the environment they live in looks so good that it could fool someone into thinking it is a place they could visit. The action always serves the story and is never there just for the sake of having explosions. Michael Bay needs to take some notes. The action is used carefully but when it's on screen it's jaw dropping. You'll find yourself cheering, laughing, and crying all with in a single action sequence. There is also a surprisingly very genuine romance at the heart of this film which makes it a great date flick. The movie breaks boundaries of genera and is made for all audiences. <br/><br/>The cast is also worth a respectable mention. This Sam Worthington guy came fast out of no where but he is definitely here to stay. It's very rare that a guy can make a sudden jump on to the scene and bring with him this much on screen charisma. He stole the show in Terminator Salvation and now totally carries the film on his shoulders here. He is a total natural and really delivers above and beyond. Zoe Saldana, his romantic interest, also made a sudden leap onto the scene and nearly steals the show. Her performance is the heart and soul of this film. It's also great to see Sigourney Weaver back in a big film. Now if only Cameron could give Michael Biehn a big break like that too. There isn't a single weakness in this cast.<br/><br/>Avatar really is the big event that Cameron has promised it to be. If I had to pick any flaw with it I'd say some of the dialogue could use revising and I'd really like the physics of how mountains in this world float explained. All in all though, it's very hard to think of anything to complain about this movie. Cameron has proved that he has still got what it takes and that time has only added more wisdom to his film-making style. This film is deserving of great financial success, critical praise, and Academy Award nominations. If you're only going to see one film this year then this would be a good choice. It is a movie that must be seen on the big screen. I don't care how big and impressive your HD TV is because it can't possible do this film justice. Hopefully this will remind audience and filmmakers what movies have been missing these days. Story is the most important aspect of any film. Filmmakers must remember this or films are doomed to mediocrity. Avatar is a must see!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Last minute: James Cameron nominated to Best Director?!?! How about best Best Marketing Person category for Golden Globes? I do pity anyone who thought that Avatar was worthy to be voted for in the top 250 movies of all time. You have been brainwashed real well.<br/><br/>Pity all of you who saw more in the movie than special effects. Avatar is like empty calories meal - you get satisfied, fat, and unhealthy. It brings NOTHING to the cinematography's history. James C. is a hack.<br/><br/>James C. is incapable of creating an original screenplay; he's good at exploiting of actual stories (Titanic, for example), but creating screenplays is his very weak side. He is not the \"King of the World\"; he is a B-quality director, not able to direct movies above B level. He just doesn't know what makes a classical movie, and yes, with my 20+ years experience as a movie watcher and real life experience, I could teach him a thing or two about directing timeless movies. Example: Peter Jackson and the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings - the original content (story by J.R.Tolkien, which I read when I was in 5th grade of elementary school), is a cinematographic experience 1,000s of times way above the over-hyped Avatar.<br/><br/>James C. stating he is the next Stanley Kubrick; he may as well declare himself the next Jesus Christ, and get the same level of credibility. He is a vain hack with overblown ego. Working with \"yes\" men has its disadvantages, measured in $ when the flick goes public.<br/><br/>I paid $13.5 for IMAX 3D version of the movie, plus another $13.5 for my company. I would like my money refunded since there was no artistic value, only marketing value that fell way under the created expectations. The movie industry will never refund your money for inadequate consumer experience.<br/><br/>This is the biggest problem with Hollywood these days - these leeches, considering self \"kings of the world\", will suck money out of you promising you everything including the kitchen sink, and grossly delivering .<br/><br/>Anyone voting for Avatar to let it be in 250 most popular movies is in my mind a person lacking ability of retrospective or simply immature enough to rate the movie where it belongs compared to other movies.<br/><br/>Poor victims of marketing machine and following the herd, a.k.a. the majority of society - the conformists, who would not dare to go to the movies to see this hallow flick, for the fear of being ostracized by friends and coworkers.<br/><br/>It's one of the movies I will not watch more than once. There are 100s of movies I can watch over and over again, but James C. just doesn't get the difference between the 2 kinds of movies. The difference it's pretty universal for all kind of audience. I could provide consulting services if they wouldn't hurt egos. I have watched 1,000s of movies in my life (25+ years), and I know what captivates the audience, and what makes the audience want to stare at a window for 2 hours without paying any admission money, and remaining with better experience than being a witness to as such painful and expensive experience as Avatar.<br/><br/>PS. Thank you for finding this review unuseful. You just proved to be oblivious to sci-fi movies history of the last 60+ years. If you think that JC invented something new with his \"Acr*ptavar\", you are the non-critical \"i'll bend over and take it however you sell it to me\" kind of reviewer.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">After Titanic (1997) Cameron literally disappeared from mainstream Hollywood for over a decade. Apparently he spent most of that decade on this film - developing the technology, the script and a new language polishing it in every possible way. I have always yearned about how all the good old classic films came out at a time when I was just unable to visit movie theaters (either because I did not exist or for some other reason). As such, I was very keen to see this supposedly \"path-breaking\" movie in its full glory - which is what I did. And I'm certainly glad I did it for Avatar is not just a movie, but (literally) an experience which I will cherish for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>There is no need for me to waste space on telling you the story since by now everybody is well aware of it. Although the story may appear simple, its treatment and translation on screen comes out effortlessly and credit for this must go to Cameron, for his direction is such that you're never left with any dull moments in the film. The movie proceeds at a brisk pace so much so that 15 minutes in the movie you find yourselves on Pandora itself.<br/><br/>Technically, the film just shines on every level, be it the cinematography, the effects and the sound. Although the CGI aliens had a cartoonist feel in the trailers, this is quickly dispelled by watching them on the big screen. As for the camera-work, it looks as if Cameron was able to enter the virtual world of Pandora and shoot just as if he were shooting in a real world - you not only get the overview shots that display the beauty of Pandora but also the shaky cam effect so common in The Bourne Trilogy - only seeing it in a virtual world is an altogether different effect.<br/><br/>As for the planet, it is simply a beauty and in this age of vulgarity and cheap humor it appears as a marvelous piece of art. Most of the CGI sequences are created from scratch but is appears as though this planet has been built separately first following which the actors have shot in the virtual world. The leaves and dust flowing around effects are so seamlessly done that you may be fooled for a second or two into thinking that it's real despite knowing it's CG at the back of your mind.<br/><br/>The movie however shines when viewed in 3-D. As already mentioned by many people, the 3-D is seamless - it is not forced at every opportunity but is created with the purpose of taking you a step closer towards Pandora. Special mention must go to the cockpit sequences - they successfully convince you into believing you're riding in it. I was initially skeptical of the 3-D after viewing the negative comments regarding the glasses, dark unclear images, headaches and the like but I've experienced none of those issues (the very fact that I'm writing this shows that I'm not on a headache). This movie is simply meant to be seen in 3-D regardless of the ticket price.<br/><br/>The only things I found lacking (fans may ignore this) were a little less character development and a little less detail. I loved the scriptment (yes I read it beforehand and still loved the movie) - it had so much detail and everything was explained in a crystal clear manner. In the movie, you're on Pandora within 15 minutes. Because I already knew all the details (I was tracking this movie for the last 3 months) I did not have a problem. Not sure about some others though. I'm now convinced that the future earth sequences should have been included.<br/><br/>In summary, Avatar has everything a movie should have - a story, emotions, characters (albeit a little less developed) and fantastic direction being the prime requisites. The technical achievements only raise the quality of the movie and take it up by many notches. And the 3-D converts this movie into an experience which will stay with you for a long time. The is not just a movie - it's an event. Those missing it experience of a lifetime or compromising on it's quality for a few dollars are definitely going to be sorry 20 years into the future. Those that do not will be smiling at themselves, relishing it and narrating it to their kids with pride. After all, it's not often that a Star Wars arrives which we can catch in theaters.

Some screens at the multiplex were showing this movie in 2D and as far as I could determine the 3D ticket price was the same (3D specs included in price)! Why would anybody want to see this movie in 2D??<br/><br/>Being a die-hard trekkie, I knew I'd enjoy this movie and it didn't disappoint in any area. My last experience of 3D was those multi-coloured cardboard thingies from the 80's that never really set the scene alight. This was altogether something different with solid framed specs framing an absolutely perfect 3D experience. Sure, I'd rather the recent Star Trek movie had been my first 3D Real D experience... next time.<br/><br/>The movie? Go see it. Don't d/l an AVI or even wait for the DVD/BluRay.

The attention to detail on another level.. Even avengers end game after 10 years can't come near as this in special effects. . Is it the budgets, the time it takes. Why? The CGI still not as advance as this.<br/><br/>I know why Mr. Cameron will not release another one soon..\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">First, it was great to see Ripley back on the screen, wasn't it? <br/><br/>The Good: It was a simply spectacular film from an artist and technical perspective. Cameron has driving the animation art way forward. Avatar will most likely be nominated for and win in a variety of categories: special effects, art direction, music...perhaps direction and best picture. I imagine we will see many more 3D movies in the future, this is only the beginning.<br/><br/>The Bad: One category it won't win for is writing. The plot is thin (but who needs plot, right?). The characters were stereotypical, just another Cowboys and Indians story from the Indians' perspective with the Cowboys as the bad guys. The ecological theme was weak and trite, at best.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Why was Humanity portrayed at it's worst? We, as the human race, was portrayed as a bunch of thugs who destroy everything in it's path for monetary gain. OK, OK, I understand that the race has a dark history of destruction, particularly western civilization and it's conquest of the third world, and Americans in particular in it's conquest of the native tribes. We all know these stories. If it was portrayed as though it were just a few rogues out for selfish gain, I would have no problem with that. It could have been resolved by taking out the thugs. But couldn't we, just for once, see humanity at it's BEST? Couldn't Cameron have portrayed us as being inherently good with the desire to do right by cultures and places we don't understand? Couldn't we, the human race, been part of the solution, not the entire problem? Couldn't that have been done and still achieved the drama and conflict that film needs to drive the story forward? As a viewer, I really wanted to feel like I was a good guy, not a bad guy.<br/><br/>I guess that when we understand that James Cameron's primary objective was simply to make as much money as possible, then the rest actually makes sense. Hollywood, as personified by Cameron, will destroy everything in it's path to achieve the money goal. Even if it means sacrificing our Humanity in the process.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This film is one of a kind as nothing has ever been done before. The SGI is absolutely phenomenal for 2009 and the story is amazing. I love how they go into coffin like cylinder and are connected to the machines to go to sleep to be woken up as an avatar in Pandora (the alternative world)<br/><br/>Jack the main character is a paraplegic but not in Pandora which I thought was a really good spin on things. The baddies make you want to kill them which always equals for a well played baddie, in my opinion anyways.<br/><br/>The scene when they attack the mother tree is super sad and the music to that scene is totally moving.<br/><br/>FUN FACT: It's one of the highest grossed films ever at over 2 billion US dollars<br/><br/>After 11 years they are releasing an Avatar 2 but still to be confirmed properly.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">As much as I don't agree with all of director James Cameron's ideologies, I do respect him as a filmmaker and a storyteller. For better evidence, I looked into his grand epic, Avatar. Released in 2009, it brought innovative visions in CGI, motion capture, and 3D. With a total of $760 million in the US, and over $2 billion worldwide, Avatar sits on top as the highest-grossing movie of all-time. Interestingly enough, the last movie to hold that honor was James Cameron's last prior release, Titanic.<br/><br/>A lot of movies come with the 3-act structure. With a running time of 2 hours and 41 minutes, I assessed the plot of Avatar by dividing it into 4 even quarters. The first quarter is where Jake Sully becomes an operator of a Na'vi-human hybrid, or an avatar, as part of the Avatar Program over at an RDA camp on Pandora. Jake enters his avatar form by going to sleep. It's slow-moving at first, but as Jake's avatar stumbles upon a tribe of Na'vi, the second quarter kicks off. At that point, the plot begins to build up as we are introduced to this unique species that it centers around. Jake and his crew begin to delve further into the Na'vi, as his avatar becomes one of them and even gets initiated into the tribe. Here, we see how the Na'vi live, survive, and act. It even leaves an impact on Jake as he resists Colonel Miles Quaritch's orders to make the Na'vi abandon their home. The third quarter kicks off when Quaritch leads an attack on the Na'vi and their home. This is where the conflict comes in to interfere with our characters and the Na'vi's trust with Jake is tested. Finally, the fourth quarter is where the battle between the Na'vi and the RDA takes place and brings our movie to an exciting climax and eventual resolution.<br/><br/>Together, these four quarters present an engaging story that builds up at every moment. Avatar finds James Cameron changing the game of filmmaking. It justifies his place as one of the best in original storytelling, as he invents a new species, a new location, a new language, and basically, a new culture. It's not only original in storytelling, but also in visual effects and cinematography. Avatar tells a story about a new world, and it tells us how James Cameron became the king of the world, twice.<br/><br/>Score: 92/100<br/><br/>Recommendation: Anyone</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">i watched this yesterday and i was really disappointed, i cannot see what people see in this movie. the story makes no sense at all, all the characters are really clichéd, and the whole movie is ridiculously predictable.<br/><br/>especially the plot element with the marine being in a wheelchair feels really forced, seeing some guy in a wheelchair in a spaceship between walking mecha-robots felt unreal, even more unreal than the sigourney weaver character smoking inside a tech lab 150 years in the future...<br/><br/>as for the visuals, they might be the best effects to date, but the world of pandora still doesn't look real. it has a computer-gamish look on it, and since the whole storyline is like something someone wrote down in 10 minutes for a computer game, i couldn't help but feeling like i was watching some game trailer.</div>,\n",

However, the natives on Pandora, the Na'vi, are unwilling to give up their land. Handicapped marine Jake Sully is part of the Avatar Project, a project in which humans transfer their consciousness to their Na'vi counterpart to aid in relocating the Na'vi residing on the biggest deposit of Unobtainium in the area.<br/><br/>Although the storyline sounds promising, and it is a rare film in which the earthlings are cast as the villains, this film is forgettable.

First of all, see this film, one of the best this year, and I have seen about 80 films. The actors are put through their paces by James Cameron, as always and it shows with performances which are excellent,course it looks too.<br/><br/>Along with the story of, You forget where you are in this film, a mix of Pocahontas, The New World, but set in the future and on another planet instead of America discovered by the Conquistadors. My only disappointment is why the regular showing was not digital, is beyond me. See this film, it is a joy to seeing this.<br/><br/>As for 3d, I went to a preview two months ago and saw the 3d trailer, which was 15 minutes, 7 minutes in, I took the damn 3d glasses of and just watched it's funny colours, but at least I could make out what was happening as appose to the crap so called 3d.

James Cameron always thinks about what his going to do in each of his films and he does this brilliantly. The effects in avatar are mind blowing and the music is great. I'm simply having trouble understanding that if it is such a basic film and not the epic everyone says it is then why is it at the top of the world wide box office charts.

The story is an old tried and true plot, but with a fantastic sci-fi plot.

Do not wait for it to come to hove video. This one needs to be experience on the big screen and in stunning 3D.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I won't state the obvious, you've read it in all the other comments; this is an amazing visual film!! You simply *cannot* tell this is CGI!! You cannot! Of course to be honest, the fact that this is an alien world with nothing to compare it with, helps Cameron and I have a suspicion that if they were trying to re-create Earth and human actors, the end result wouldn't be so believable. But nevertheless, Cameron actually *brings* you into Pandora and you will simply fall in love with this world and it's natives, the Na'vi.<br/><br/>Lots of commenters have said that the story/plot was stale and old. Yes, the plot has been done before... the foreigner (human in this case) falls in love with the native ... Pocahontas anyone? But in the end... so what!? Seriously, how many stories *haven't* been told? What exactly would you consider original? This is the post-modern age... we've seen it all; the romance, the gory, the idiotic and now movie makers are focusing on scaring us by not showing anything... playing with our psyche because our *eyes* have seen it all. Except Pandora... you haven't seen anything like that. I loved the story... yes it was Pocahontas all over again in another setting but so what? I think the simple story worked for this film. I really left the viewing with a smile on my face. I didn't have to ponder over difficult questions and I could focus on the visual Heaven Cameron created. Not that this film is without it's moral lessons... I was kind of ashamed I am human and really wanted to turn blue.. at the end I was playing for the blue side and so will you... If this is the future of cinema, well I can't wait for what comes next... because I tell you, everything else after this, kinda feels stale!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It has been 12 years since Cameron unleashed the phenomenon that was Titanic and real fans would have to look as far back as 1991's Terminator 2 for their last proper dose of his incredibly epic action (True Lies, while fun, really doesn't count). So the anticipation for Avatar has long since reached fever pitch and beyond.<br/><br/>Thankfully for the patient masses, Avatar has turned out to be the biggest and best event movie of the year, perhaps the decade. The story is pure Cameron simplicity – a paraplegic ex-marine is given a chance to walk again through the use of a unique alien body, called an Avatar. It is his job to gain the trust of the natives so that a greedy corporation can steal the precious metal from their lush moon. Jake's (Sam Worthington) crippled main character is the perfect point of contact for the audience – not only is he new to the visual delights of Pandora but his disability means that every moment in his Avatar body is one of glorious freedom from the confinement of his chair. When the Corporations intentions become more sinister, Jake must choose between his new found place with the natives and his own race and fight for what he believes in.<br/><br/>Avatar combines parts of Pocahontas and Braveheart with a liberal dose of Space Marines into an epic whole that takes nearly three full hours to unfold. We could criticise that length, the weak story and the hammy dialogue. We could attack its thinly-veiled ecological message or the frankly bizarre spirituality in its second half but honestly nothing can spoil the experience while you are enveloped in it. And a large part of that is down to the brilliant use of 3D – which is both subtle and incredibly effective. Til now, we have been making movies with 3D elements, Avatar is the first truly 3D film and might well prove to be one of the most significant things to happen to blockbuster film-making since Star Wars.<br/><br/>Cameron is also pushing the envelope with truly photo-real CG – something which has been promised for years but has finally been delivered with Avatar. The interactions of the characters with the environment is incredible and the detail on the faces of the motion-captured leads (Worthington and Star Trek's Zoe Saldana) bring them to life. You will believe totally in their performances, representing another quantum leap in tools which have rarely been used for anything other than spectacle.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Avatar is an important film from a technical standpoint but it is also great entertainment. The world of Pandora is a stunning spectacle from scene to scene and as Jake learns more about the Na'vi the film approaches the kind of light hearted adventure story which has been absent from movie theatres for years. Then the final act explodes into tragedy and desperate action, with the final half hour a blistering life or death struggle that has to be seen to be disbelieved.<br/><br/>Over the coming days you will be hearing a lot about Avatar, and some of the critical reaction is bound to focus on its weaknesses in a bid to appear appropriately reserved and objective. But this is not a film to be dissected or examined, rather one to be experienced with a warm crowd, a great sound system, in 3D as you bask in the knowledge that the movie-making master is back!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I saw it. I bowed down to the hype and went and saw the mighty Avatar in 3D IMAX. I am supposed to like this movie, right? Well, the first hour was great, the 3D effects were very trippy and the film contained the only convincing CGI I have ever seen. Up until now I have found CGI, for the most part, laughable. Once I got used to the 3D- and the hardcore corniness kicks in, I found the film almost unbearable. I know Cameron is making a film to appeal to the lowest common denominator- but some of that dialog was inexcusably bad. Sure, dumb it down for the masses- but not that far down! The repeated love affirmation \"I see you\" being an example. I'm guessing he had to use terms a simpleton would use because he was already counting his dollars as knew he would eventually have to dub the movie in every real language out there. <br/><br/>Another complaint: Even though the supposed bad guys in the movie were American military and mercenaries- I still thought they managed to glorify imperialist violence with all the \"kick-ass\" bravado and the subtle inspirational music during attack on the big tree. I'm sure most kids and meat-heads in the audience were thinking \"yeah, burn that hippie tree down and its kill those Blue Man Group kooks.\" <br/><br/>Also, I can't help but wonder if people truly enjoyed the barrage of quantum psycho-babble that infected the movie like a virus. I admit that Sigourney Weavers little speech to Giovanni Ribisi about the network of energy being alive was mildly interesting- especially when found in a blockbuster. But were people really feeling the Na'vi's cross-legged arm to arm spiritual rejuvenation dance? I found it silly. <br/><br/>I did enjoy exploring the Na'vi world and of course the psychedelic colors of the forest and dragons were amazing to look at. But as the minutes worn on and it became yet another hour long good vs. evil battle sequence\n",
       "  I had had enough. Been there, done that, don't need to see it again. But the nail in the coffin of me basically disliking the film was the god-awful saintly forest song as the credits rolled. Did you hear that \"music\"?

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I heard that Cameron took 3 weeks to write the plot. Really? That long? It's a shame that after spending all that money on the very pretty CGI they didn't have anything left to spend on a plot or a proper story or any characters that were anything more than cartoon cut-outs.<br/><br/>So the Americans (yes, you know they are) go to another strange land to rob it of its mineral wealth and they first have to get the natives to move out of the way. The natives use bows and arrows, paint their faces and have great respect for the forces of nature. It's another modern \"Western\" straight out of the \"Dances With Wolves\" school.<br/><br/>The hero is straight out of \"John Carter of Mars\" (the books, not the terrible film), the heroine is Pocahontas, but with more flesh exposed - even if it is blue - to keep the adult males happy. The baddies are all super-evil psychotics without a single redeeming feature.<br/><br/>What a waste of time and talent</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I never got the fuss around this film, yes it is animated, and the computer animations are very good in it, probably looks good in 3D if that is what you care about. But if the visual art is the only reason to watch it, then i consider that there are better alternatives (anime / animated movies ) for visual art + entertainment. I think i saw dancing with the wolves AFTER i had seen avatar (if i remember correctly) and i still thought it was more interesting, somehow its hard to grasp any too interesting details from this movie, even though i'm nature and culture of hunter gatherers.<br/><br/>The whole idea of the movie is kind of weird, but i guess that is the point, and like i said surely the animation quality is pretty good, and there are some entertaining scenes, it is okay/good for entertainment purposes.<br/><br/>So yeah, it sure deserves 6/10, but i'm not too sure about it deserving as much as it is praised for, but people like what they like, this is just my opinion.</div>,\n",

       " The film's use of 3D technology is perfect. Its perfection lies in not showing off, but in being so real that you are barely aware of it. There are no vertigo double images or vomit-inducing visual mismatches, but there is an immersive reality, layered vistas and close-ups, and animals, plants and humans within reach. The extraordinary natural scenery in the film is amazing, and many beautiful and strange plants make us admire the director's imagination and sense of responsibility, because these are in the premise that science can reasonably explain.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I had heard a lot about \"Avatar\" before seeing it, and the general complaint from most was the movie's lack of originality. Having seen the movie, I would agree that the premise is nowhere near unique, but to me originality shouldn't be the basis for judging the quality of a film. More than anything a truly great movie should be striking, and Avatar is precisely that. James Cameron used his budget ($237m) to create one of the most engrossing environments to ever grace the screen, and pushed the 3D technology (which I don't even like) to the limit. The result is pure spectacle; behind me in the movie theater there was a family with three children and throughout the 2 1/2 hours there were constant exclamations of \"Wow!\" and \"Oohh!\" at every new vista. I would have been slightly annoyed had I not realized I wanted to say the same things, and for a movie to revert a hardened critic like me to a world of pure escapist wonder, I have to give the film credit.</div>,\n",

The first thing one has to say is the plot, as other have mentioned, is a direct lift from Dances With Wolves.<br/><br/>To quote Edmund Blackadder 'it was as predictable as a predictable thing can be predicted', something I was quite (un)happily doing throughout the film. It isn't even so bad it's good - although there a couple of unintentionally funny scenes (well I laughed).<br/><br/>The actors do the best they can with a very average script with Steven Lang as the main hate character in a destroy everything sort of way, played so over the top he could be a pantomime villain. It's not his fault of course, James Cameron directed him! The CG graphics/special effects look OK but gave me no real sense of warmth to the characters, I didn't find then innovative just a bit soulless.<br/><br/>If 2 and a half hours of overly blue CGI/Special effects is your thing OK but I found it a total waste of the time.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">AVATAR... is fun. It's huge fun. The whole movie is huge. There is everything here, there is enormous explosions, shootings, space ships, but that's not the best part.<br/><br/>The best part of Avatar is the world that Cameron created. And that world AMAZES however we think about the plot. It's perfectly designed, totally believable and simply beautiful. And magic. It is magic. It's not Tim Burton's magic, it's different magic. BIGGER, more epic and simply - breathtaking. Enough about it.<br/><br/>The story is new Pocahontas but some good messages mixed in. The acting is decent but nothing award-worthy here, apart from an evil military guy who was really good.<br/><br/>The movie is epic, and whatever you and your friend think about it, YOU NEED TO GO OUT AND SEE IT, IN 3D! because this movie, -even though not a success at the Oscars (well, effects were certain, pictures a surprise but still not that many here) - will, and already did, make a history becoming real fast the biggest grossing film in HISTORY of the world.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is, as you will have seen from other reviews, probably the most visually stunning movie ever made. The scenes of the beauty of Pandora will knock you out! Watching the movie it was very easy to forget (and I did) that the characters were CGI creatures, so real were they implemented. The beauty of the film is contrasted with the gung ho American marines and the greed of the mining company trying to exploit the natural resources of Pandora, without in any way understanding its beauty or the close bond felt by the Pandorans to their environment and the other life on the planet.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is excellent and the soundtrack superb, frequently making you jump with unexpected highly realistic sounds.<br/><br/>The best film I have seen in a very long time, way up there with the Lord of the Rings, my previous favourite film (and story) of all time.<br/><br/>I felt that the Director was trying to say something about man in this film, on the one hand able to be noble and capable of creating stunning beauty (just see the visuals in this film) and the contrasting violence, greed and stupidity that we can show. God knows what will happen if and when we do meet aliens, they will probably be shot to pieces before we can ever learn anything about them! In summary, don't hesitate to see this film, I defy you not to be enthralled in the stunning beauty of Pandora and the superb story.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I did read up about comments here and external reviews, before I went to see the movie. I expected a bad story and stunning visual effects. I got to see a very bad and very predictable story and I thought the visual effects were not that good.<br/><br/>The panoramas were nice, certainly. The graphic world was nice, with the forests, the alien creatures, the huge machines and planes of the humans. But I thought it was very well visible that it all is CGI. It's animations. Why would people say that you can hardly see it's CGI... do they think we're stupid? I've seen computer games lately that look just as stunning. And in 5 years, we'll just remember this movie as \"nice graphics for its time, but the story sucks\".<br/><br/>I agree with the reviews of Avatar being a mixture / ripoff / remake of Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, FernGully, Last Samurai, Enemy Mine, Lawrence of Arabia. Cameron did a much better job on Alien and Terminator. Did people finally convince him that his audience is stupid? I did quite a few face-palms while sitting in my chair. I started drinking a lot (thanks to our service cinema for providing this lovely feature), because I was bored. Predictable. As soon as I saw the main character sit in his wheelchair I knew: he is going to one of those Na'vi. Predictable. As soon as I saw the huge tree, I knew they were going to blow it up. Really. Barf.<br/><br/>I still don't understand why humanity of 2154 needs a whole fleet of airplanes to cut a high tree, since we already have neutron bombs now. You want to eradicate the aliens, get the tree out of the way, and not let the public at home know you did something terrible? Throw the neutron bomb and nobody will know. The area will be easily accessible with big digging machines, because there will hardly be any radioactive fallout. I know, it's evil, but that's the way these evil humans are in this movie. But that would be a short story, wouldn't it.<br/><br/>Go see Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Aliens, Terminator, Silence of the Lambs... or so many other films. Nice stories, some unpredictable plot changes and ditto character developments, grey (vs black&amp;white) characters.<br/><br/>I happily would give it a 1 / 10, but I did like the graphics. I did not like the plot, the story, the characters, the character developments.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">When I first saw this film at relative's house back in 2009, I could only sum it up as \"Wow. That was incredible\". I've probably watched it 3 times now over the past few years, my views have changed. Let me try to show think: <br/><br/>On the visual side, it's like man going to the moon. The CGI is breathtaking, realistic and I can't even begin to imagine what it's like on 3D display. It is a milestone for CGI. <br/><br/>On the storside it's like a pack of mints. A nice taste at first, but after while you get bored of it. To be perfectly honest, the storyline is VERY basic-man meets people, man wants to be like people, man 'betrays' his own kind, massive battle, the end. The problem I have is that there is just nothing to it. A film like Inception has hundreds of other sidestories within it. I really couldn't find that many, or any that were good, in Avatar. It's just a too basic for my liking. Also, I didn'y feel any emotion. When I saw War Horse, I was on the edge of my seat, sweating. It was exhilarating and emotional. Avatar just didn't have that. Sure, the last attack scene is pretty awesome, but I just didn't feel any exhilaration or emotion. This is where it falls down. And I think that it's a really big shame that it does this, because if it cleared up these parts, it would be amazing. <br/><br/>In conclusion, it's great at first, and you will gawk at the CGI, but there is very little else to it, and this is what lets it down.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Cameron really knows his drama. A tear-jerking love story, the heartfelt downfall at its climax: he applies the rules of drama like few others can. That said this reeks of a routine to go for. Despite such skills deserving high praise its repetition can't be said to be the epitome of greatness. On the contrary: besides these qualities we'd like to have some substance. To make things shine is great but a lame standard shining bright is a lame standard still. Nice colours, lots of emotion and baffling CGI: it is almost to be held against a film if all it does is hiding the mediocrity of its plot and its implications (\"its meaning\" that is). That said Avatar may still be the film that uses 3D technology best. That spells genuine innovation and adds to cinema as a whole. That is a method to be repeated and copied - only that this one is the original and hasn't been copied yet. That's truly commendable and a great feat. <br/><br/>Anyway: I love philosophy, actual meaning in films and something to think about. Even the best and most innovative use of 3D can't cover all that, can it? So yeah... At this point I see a decent film but no more.<br/><br/>There is a lot more to it though. The setting as such betrays a deep insight into the Zeitgeist, into the hidden desires of present time viewers. It is an ode to technology, to the possibility to shape one's self as well as connecting to others. At the same time the demolition of the old and the bringers of this technology are put in a harsh light. Indeed: we do not trust our own progress. We love it and fear it at the same time. We wish for unlimited possibilities, the transcendence of time, space and body, yet we also wish for stability, harmony and peace. It is impossible to fulfill the conflicting desires of our time. Or is it? <br/><br/>Avatar manages to combine the conservative and the progressive and that is not a small feat. Living as an \"Avatar\", like me being Mario in a Video Game, is where it starts. Right into the promises of the past: actually meaningful human relations, breaking things down to the eternally important parts of life, a harmonious tradition. The clash is quite literal: the colonial high-tech army against the natives of a paradise, living in harmony with themselves and their nature.<br/><br/>However: the Na'Vi do not just work as a safe harbour, a bastion against the flood of progress. They also bring a promise we know as new, as a part of progress in our own world. They can \"upload\" their experiences, \"download\" the past and connect to other living beings by \"jacking in\". That is exactly how they \"become one with nature\", how their \"natural\", \"traditional\" lifestyle works. They manage to unite our conflicting desires and truly appeal to something most people do not even see. It is keen insight that looks immensely deep what is required to create this specific instantiation of a superficially glossy fantasy world. It's the \"Internet Indians\", the unity of everything, that many oh-so sophisticated viewers overlook when complaining about the flatness of this eye-candy. <br/><br/>Avatar holds a grasp on THE desire of our time. There is substance. Since \"Matrix\" it is customary to have a film claim depth. Where Matrix actually does hold depth, although not behind every Greek name and wisecrack reference, many others did not. Lots of references, likening one's film to insightful classics: people see depth where it is supposed. This one on the other hand appeals to emotions and thankfully never really pretends to be a piece of philosophy. Only that it is. It truly is a milestone. <br/><br/>If I wouldn't detest the plastic perfection, the glossy finish and the flat plot I'd rate this even higher. Even so I can't help but acknowledge the mastery this film was done with as well as its creators' insights into the big questions of our time. Truly a great film!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Read many comments in here before seeing this and they were spot on. This film is so beautiful and stunning it defies belief. Felt to me like seeing a film hundreds of years in the future. Story line is great and the Nav'i capture your heart very strongly. Avatar has taken movie creatures and special effects many, many steps forward. Some people have likened this to Dances With Wolves and there is a simple parallel but it is a great understatement. Telling folks about this verbally I simply say \"words cannot convey.\" It is fairly long but so engrossing that one does not notice. It is so incredibly good, I will be shocked if it does not reach top 20 of all time in here. Saw it without the 3D and imagine that in 3D it would just simply blow the audience's brains clean out of their skulls. Indeed this film is a landmark and a new one to beat. Cannot imagine that happening anytime soon. Bravo, bravo, bravo!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's a tremendous achievement of film-making, but it's not the second coming as has been widely rumored. Things I liked: incredible imagery, awesome 3D, excellent acting, a simple well-executed story, characters that we care about (even the aliens), action drama romance--the works. Things I didn't like: I hate it when I see movies which glorify \"indigenous peoples\" and act as though our modern day culture has nothing to offer. I think it's too simple minded, and offensive to both sides of the coin. I'm insulted because there's a lot of good things about the culture of the developed world, and there are good things about the undeveloped world--or primitive worlds of the past. However, to paint the Na'vi as a people who're totally happy, need nothing, have everything...who seem, somehow, to have the perfect life living the primitive life they do...it's irritating. It takes greater skill as a writer and director to paint both sides in an accurate way: both sides having good and bad traits (as is realistic), both sides having good and bad individuals. Instead, here we have the Na'vi as ALL good, the scientists ALL good, and the corporate folks all bad. Retarted. Additionally, I felt like the anti-corporate slant was a little tired. It just pandered overtly to the recent anti-\"fat cats on Wall Street\" and sense of resentment about those unidentified rich people who started the recession. Lame. Grow up. We're such a society of self-loathing, self-hating people who resent it when others make more than we do, always wishing to be like those societies of old who mythically had the perfect life...and this movie seemed to be attempting to tap into that self-hatred. Anyway, masterful film-making with that last exception.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Not a masterpiece but good.\n",
       " But this movie did not deserve this box office.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Have IQ's dropped sharply while I was gone? The overwhelming special effects of Avatar simply cannot hide the vacuousness of its story. As just about anyone who can read has noticed, the plot is a rehash of the \"civilised man goes native\" fable popularized from \"Last of the Mohicans\" to the present day (I'm sure even the ancient Egyptians have a version preserved in hieroglyphs somewhere on a dusty temple wall). The CGI is realistic enough that you can become engaged with the digital characters... except, then your attention is focused on the story. Which is almost as lame as a 6th graders summer vacation essay.<br/><br/>I did not see the movie in 3D as I assumed it would be pointlessly distracting. I have seen polarized 3D movies before. Starting with one of the first, \"The Bubble\" in the late 60's. The peak of this in-your-face technology was reached years ago in the 70's with the release of \"The Stewardesses\". Nothing in this movie can compete with real 3D boobs.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">There's enough reviews, my only complaint is a major technical one that you would think Cameron would have noticed given that he went over every frame of the movie a thousand times. Why are the Avatars approximately 9 feet tall for the entire movie (you get a good idea of their scale in the first scene when he wakes up in his new Avatar and breaks out of the lab. The Avatars are 3-4 feet taller than an average human) THEN - in one of the final scenes SPOILERRRR!!! When the Avatars are lined up in a row and overseeing the humans marching onto their ship to go back to earth after the Avatars win the war, the Avatars are MORE THAN DOUBLE AND LOOKS LIKE TRIPLE THE SIZE OF A HUMAN!! There's one shot and Giovanni Ribisi's character looks like he's looking at a cloud. I think the artists got the perspective wrong or something. Humans barely come up to the knees of the Avatars in this one scene but in the hand to hand combat scene between Worthington's character and the Colonel guy they're reasonably close in size. This is my only review of the movie other than the story is far more simple than I expected. I judge a movie by whether or not I would see it again and I doubt I would see this again.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's got something for everyone, romanticized compassion with love for \"Mother Earth\" for the gals, and lots of mechanical high-tech blow-ups, blow-outs....for the guys. It isn't too mushy and it doesn't beat you over the head with PC....it's great fun for everyone. Just go for the sheer joy of the paintings....and the special effect worlds...gorgeous. It's story is familiar (A Man called Horse/Dances with Wolves) but updated for the future, when man is heading out to other planets...warnings....about human attitudes.<br/><br/>Horner's music is luscious as usual, with shades of Titanic, Legends of the Fall...and Trek...combined. Worth every penny spent on it. Can't wait for more films of this type....with more story line.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I remember watching this in the cinema back in the day. I sat through a fim and tought, okay there will be a character that does not react the way which is totally predictable. But... there is not. It's like a childrens tale with CGI nothing more. Everything in it is black and white, there is no grey. The - not so - subliminal (political) messages are also mega annoying: the evil white people occupying, murdering etc. the poor indigenous tribe, nature against technology, spirtualism against science etc. At the end the happy blue smirfs win and in their grace they let the humans leave the planet...\n",
       " Unfortunatly the next step in which the humans a) nuclear bomb the planet hardly b) throw down some niche chemical / biological weapons to exterminate all the Navi, is not shown.<br/><br/>The film also represents a bad step in Hollywood history. This was a financially very sucessful film that had a very thin, incredibly cliche storyline and a lot of visual effects. It paved the way for films which want to excel only through visuals and think it will all be allright if they skip the story.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Yes, it looks amazing. I don't understand how you can say the plot is flat and there are no characters and then give it an 8/10. Sure, for 45 minutes, I was going 'wow'. But then you get used to it. And you need something else to keep you going.<br/><br/>How about some character motivation? I didn't feel like I knew any of the characters by the end of the movie. They were action movie clichés which seems to indicate we don't need to know anything about them. All we need to know is the bad guy has big scars on his head. Apparently, that's enough to explain why he wants to snuff out blue people so much.<br/><br/>This movie didn't know what it was about. The US war in Vietnam? Native Americans being removed from their land by high tech invaders? Saving the planet? The world wide web?<br/><br/>The way the web was lumped into this so crudely just made me sigh. It makes The Matrix look street. I know Cameron is old but come on.<br/><br/>Whereas The Dark Knight kept people guessing, nothing in this movie happens which you wouldn't expect to happen, at exactly the point it happens.<br/><br/>I'd say it was very disappointing if it wasn't for the fact this is pretty much as bad as I expected it to be. In the preview screening I was at, quite a few people decided to make for their last train rather than sit through the predictable finale.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Going into the theater, I didn't put too much hope into this film. Even though I love pretty much all of Cameron's work (with the exception of, maybe, Piranha II), these days you can't take the quality of a movie for granted just because a big director is at the helm. Just look at the Star Wars prequels or Indy 4.<br/><br/>I saw Avatar on one of the biggest screens in my hometown on X-Mas-day, it was pretty much sold out and I could only get a very bad seat: first seat in row four..ouch! But you know what? Once the film started, I hardly noticed the uncomfortable viewing-position. This alone and the fact that I also hardly noticed the 160-min running time speak volumes for the quality of the film. It's been a long time since I've seen such a strange, beautiful, \"realistic\" and fantastic world brought to life so perfectly on the screen. It really puts Lucas and his Star Wars prequels to shame.<br/><br/>And yet: Even though I know that 60% of the action is CGI, I never lost my suspension of disbelief. The creatures look so life-like, the blend between real actors and computer-graphics is so seamless that it never distracts you. Granted: The story is pretty much a rehash of Last Samurai/Dances with Wolves, even down to details such as the love-story or certain characters' fates. But so what? The love-story itself should be old news ever since Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, but good variations of the theme still can cut it in our modern age. So does Avatar: Cameron shows once again why effect-fests like Transformers simply don't work: If you don't have a good story and likable, fleshed-out characters you can throw in all that CG-crap you want: The film's not gonna draw you in. Effects should always be used as a means to tell your story, to enhance your vision. And even though Avatar is full of some of the most amazing CGI I've ever seen, Cameron uses it just as that: as a film-making tool, albeit, a very powerful one.<br/><br/>Before this gets too long, let me close by highly recommending that you watch Avatar in 3D. The process works amazingly well, is used pretty subtly here and there wasn't a single shot that felt like they were just showing off the 3D-capabilities. If you've seen \"Jaws 3D\", you know what kind of shots I'm talking about.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar represents the future of entertainment, both production, distribution, and exhibition. When the technology moves to video games it will represent interactivity as well.<br/><br/>As a technological and artistic movement it is rated 10/10 and is one of the most important films made in the last twenty years and is as revolutionary as Toy Story or Star Wars.<br/><br/>Judged only on the critical literary merits of film, including plot, story, narrative, characters, subject, genre, etc. it is rated 7/10.<br/><br/>Avatar is a very solid film and presents a message that although somewhat trite and heavy handed when presented to educated liberal minded people, is sadly needing to be brow beat again and again these days into the walnut sized dinosaur brains of the blunt skull denizens crawling around the barbaric red states.<br/><br/>In cinematic terms: The Green Movement meets Pocahontas, The New World, Dances with Wolves, and Starcraft.<br/><br/>One theme on the soundtrack is very reminiscent of Willow. James Horner's signature sound is audible from the very beginning.<br/><br/>JC's love of manga and mecha is very clear, right up to then grand finale which is a really intriguing reflection of the final battle in Aliens.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver ties a lot of the film together and her voice dominates every scene she is in.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that I think JC should have done even more with the back-story and especially the science, and for a three hour film, it could have been another hour or two and I wouldn't have cared at all. It was certainly epic and the only way to see it is IMAX 3D. If you saw this film in any other format or on any other screen it would be an immediate 6/10. Bigger is better.<br/><br/>Half the fun is the total immersion that is only accomplishable by IMAX 3D and JC's brilliant direction of every aspect of what you see, hear, and feel. As groundbreaking if not more groundbreaking than any other JC film to date. A milestone in entertainment and technology that absolutely cannot be missed.</div>,\n",

(Fantastic) I won't lie by saying I enjoyed this movie as a popcorn flick, however, how it unfolds the plot was where it suffered. There seems to be underdeveloped parts to the movie that keeps it from being a modern classic. The ending especially feels forced to create political propaganda about the Native Americans. So a 4/10 for the plot. (Weak) Overall, this could've been the best movie we've all seen in years but unfortunately, the plot keeps it from getting that title. It gets a 7/10 for my rating.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">10 is much too low a score for this magnificent movie. Cameron has created his masterpiece. This movie will be watched in 100 years, possibly more so than any movie yet made. The Hurt Locker, a very good film, will be just another scratch your head moment when, 50 years from now it is remembered basically as the movie which beat out Avatar for Best Picture, and which proves that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has it's head up it's collective bum.<br/><br/>Mr. Cameron, long known for making blockbusters that are long on entertainment value and craftsmanship, but short on artistry, has now achieved both with Avatar. Avatar is the most entertaining movie that I can recollect seeing...and an artistic chef d'oeuvre which enriches the soul and makes a statement about the course of mankind and our love affair with technology that is not subtle but it sure is effective.<br/><br/>It is true, Avatar is an amalgamation of tried and true Cameron formula and technical prowess. But wait! It is ever so much more. Yes, dear critics, all the Cameron ingredients are there... but along with these ingredients there is such clarity and passion. This is something new, never before seen...and I am not speaking of 3D as good as it is... there is exquisite, aching beauty and the feeling of loss and redemption, that makes one think more of Beowulf than Terminator.<br/><br/>Ah but a man's reach exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for? If heaven is anything like Pandora, count me in. The NA'Vi are nothing more nor less than the absolute perfect incarnation of man and nature, of what we could have been, and of the very best that we cut out of ourselves, of our own indigenous people. Yes they are an idealization. But since when is it wrong to idealize? <br/><br/>The performances resonate, tear and overwhelm us with their reality, be they man or be they memorex. They may be archetypes, but when Jake Sully makes his choice, it is impossible not to cry with joy for him and yet mourn with him for what he must give up.<br/><br/>This is a profundity that I think many simply do not comprehend. Thankfully, judging by the box office, many more do. <br/><br/>Sam Worthington will be a major star, of this there is no question. His Jake Scully is a warrior but he plays the role with a certain sweet power that is astonishing. His final live action monologue is deceptive and heartbreaking. As for the rest of the cast, Zoe Saldana is exquisite as Neytiri, and Sigourney Weaver is professorial perfection as Dr. Grace Augustine.<br/><br/>Thank you Mr. Cameron, for your vision. I wish it could have lasted forever. 3 hours simply is not enough.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.<br/><br/>Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.<br/><br/>Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.<br/><br/>That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clichéd and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clichéd despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.<br/><br/>Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>9.5/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Until I see Avatar, I was not a big fan of CGI in movies. Actually I always believed in war scenes without any computers, any digital effects, we can compare war scenes in Braveheart and Lord of the Rings trilogy, former was pure human, latter was pure fabrication, I am sure of Peter Jackson said \"Come on guys, let the computers do the dirty work. Who is going to deal with this mess.\" But, Avatar and eventually James Cameron who does not have a lot of good movies, has just started a fresh method which involving both digital effects and human beings. This technology was never used like that. But I do not want to talk about Pandora's beauties, enhanced 3D stuff. I want to talk about the screenplay.<br/><br/>I heard lots of things about Avatar. Some of them were good, some of them were bad. Critics about this movie emphasized on lack of originality and human factors. They treat this movie like it was made by only computers. They treat like there is no any human factor involved. And after I see this movie, I understand that those critics are terribly wrong.<br/><br/>First, this is a Hollywood movie. So, you cannot expect a very original script, guys come on, this is a movie made by James Cameron, not Charlie Kaufman. Of course it is gonna be a little bit the same we see before. Second, you can see determination in Pandora's creation process. I have never seen such 3D things that close to reality. This cannot be just built through entering some numbers to a computer.<br/><br/>Third, let us keep examining screenplay. I expected only jumping fighting big blue guys, gunships, bombs, guns and lots of stuff like this and I did not care about the screenplay. But after I watched Avatar, you can see there are many harsh and righteous criticism about way we live. When you see Na'vi people who witnessed the destruction of their home, you say to yourself \"Wait a second. I have seen this on the news. For a dozen of times maybe!!!\". And of course, there are some environmentalist messages which we see more than rare recently. But I am not used to see such criticisms on American strategies about foreign countries in such a pure Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>Avatar is not just some guys fighting, jumping, flying on a planet which created by computers. James Cameron, surprisingly, gives a message to us, to politicians: Now can you see where we are going, where the world is going?</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Visuals: For years Star Trek, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and all sorts of other sci-fi or fantasy movies have been trying to take us to another world. This one succeeded, and it was so beautiful. I swear that I had a religious experience in reaction to the visuals to this movie, probably akin to the feeling that many people had when they watched the original Star Wars for the first time in theaters. I don't tend to get teary eyed over physical beauty that often, but this world moved me to tears from the sheer beauty of it. It was like stepping inside an expressionistic painting. If you get a chance to see this in 3D, do it! If you get a chance to see it in the theater, do it! If you miss out on all that and watch your DVD in an old tube television, well... still watch it, although you might not have quite the same reaction as everyone else. The visuals get an A, and I somehow feel that an A isn't high enough to do this movie justice.<br/><br/>Sound: If the sound had failed, then the visuals would have too. Pandora sounded alive and organic. The creatures made sounds that matched the visuals and the music superbly added to the drama of what was going on. A <br/><br/>Acting: I tip my hat to every actor in this movie. The humans interacted with the CG characters in such an organic way that I really never questioned the fact that the humans were reacting to no one. Sam Worthington, mixing this with his roles in Terminator 4 and Clash of the Titans, may be establishing himself to be the next big action star since Jason Statham. Likewise, Zoe Saldana's career is on the rise as she just came off playing Uhura in the Star Trek reboot. And then there's Stephen Lang... good Lord, I do not want him angry with me under any circumstances ever. The man was ripped in this movie and looked like he could give Chuck Norris a run for his money. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing a movie with Stephen Lang portraying a character very similar to his role as Col. Miles Quaritch, but as the movie's main protagonist instead of villain. The acting department gets an A! <br/><br/>Story: Normally, I tackle story first thing in my reviews. I saved it for last here, because I really loved this movie, but that doesn't mean that I'm blind to some issues with the storyline.<br/><br/>My initial review was too long for IMDb, to read my full review visit tacmovies.blogspot.com<br/><br/>Anyhow, this is the archetypal mole goes native story. There are some shocking similarities between it and the novel Call Me Joe, and it wouldn't be the first time that Cameron had been sued for plagiarism, as Harlan Ellison sued him over Terminator, but I still think that simultaneous creation is possible in this instance. Regardless, the story is pretty good, but it's definitely the weakest link in the chain. All of the characters played their parts in making this story function, but I definitely thought some parts were written a bit shallow, for instance (SPOILER WARNING): <br/><br/>1. The Na'vi never once thought that Jake was giving intel to the humans? I think tvtropes.com might call this \"Plot Induced Stupidity,\" especially when you consider that they only let him stay there to gain intel on the humans. Slightly hypocritical, if you ask me. Since we're on the subject, Neytin turned on Jake and immediately never wanted to see him again before the humans attacked and her father died. This despite the fact that the Na'vi mate for life and the two just mated. After taming a red dragon-like creature, she welcomes him back with open arms.<br/><br/>Okay, this functionally works to progress the story, but I think a better progression would have been to have the two mate, Jake reveals his mole status and the rest of the Na'vi turn on Jake but Neytin, feeling that strong, irrational mating bond, stands by her man until her father dies, at which point she turns on him. Jake then tames a red dragon and symbolically regains the trust of the Na'vi but it takes a little longer for Neytin to forgive him. At least, that's how I would have done it.<br/><br/>2. The evil human corporation is willing to massacre innocent natives to make a quick buck. It's so one dimensional that it's painful. Not to say that it couldn't happen, but I wanted more, and I think the movie hinted at more. In fact, Worthington's character mentioned that the earth had been ruined somehow. If we as a race no longer had a home world and were dependent upon Unobtainium to survive, and the Na'vi were unwilling to negotiate giving us any Unobtainium for over six years (which the movie stated was the timetable the negotiations had gone), then I think stealing it wouldn't necessarily have been the right thing to do morally, but necessary for the survival of the human race. The story hints that this is what's going on behind the scenes, but never says it outright probably because we the audience would turn on Jake Sully if we knew that. In any case, I would have preferred that the storyline be less cut and dry. The soldiers just started shooting. They didn't try a covert mission to steal the Unobtainium first, and the money grubbing corporation didn't recognize the potential money to be made in harvesting the forest's telepathy/soul bank? <br/><br/>Again, I thought the writing was okay, but with some major problems. C <br/><br/>Overall: You should see this movie. It's awesome. Yes, the writing is a bit shallow at times, but it's still really good in spite of the writing. A</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">First of all I would like to place upon my sincere thanks towards Mr James Cameroon for taking his valuable five years of his life for making a movie no one except him could have ever imagined.. Being under pressure of humongous amount of money stake he carried the expectations with ease and expertise.. This is not just a movie.. Its a rich experience which may eventually blow of your mind.. All in a future high-tech metaphora, of enormous weaponry and spaceships and a primitive jungle world that's both weird but also so familiar...<br/><br/>Hats off to James for his thinking and imagination..(He even created a language for the creatures living on the James-made-Planet).. For performance I would love to take two names: Sam Worthington and Michelle Rodriguez.. Both were superb in their roles.. Sam's simplicity initially will take you as a surprise and watch out for his performance during the fight sequence as a Na'vi.. He will surely walk away with loads of accolades.. Cinematography is pragmatic and enigmatic.. VFX and Graphics used are marvelous.. James' Direction is humongous superb and breath taking.. After allowing the likes of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich to try and direct large action films he returns to show them how a master does it..<br/><br/>My advice: \"Take out 3 hrs of time out of your lives(even if you are not a movie buff) to enjoy an experience nobody ever imagined.. Just buy a tub of popcorn and a soft drink and enjoy\"<br/><br/>My Rating: 9.5/10<br/><br/>Thanks &amp; Regards</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I heard so much about this movie before I watched it I couldn't wait. As advertised the special effects were spectacular. However, the movie itself was so cliche and predictable I have to assume it was written by a washed-up old hippie. Here's the plot in a nutshell. The Evil and that's EVIL with a capital E military and corporate complexes want to destroy the pure-as-driven-snow and Angelic and that's ANGELIC with a capital A non-humans who live in the trees and flowers. The Angels are perfect and just want to live their lives in peace smelling flowers and flying dragons. The military guys are all evil (well, except for the one female troop who is innocent and wonderful and the star of the flick who is paralyzed so he is physically unable to perform evil acts any more). The rest of the troops/contractors ... evil and horrible. They'll kill anyone and anything just because. There is no nuance to this movie at all. There are two distinct groups and one is all good and one is all bad. As a 30 year military veteran I was seething when it was over. I wanted to rate it 1 out of 10 stars but that would not be fair to the fantastic special effects. With a little effort this movie could have been outstanding. It wasn't. In my opinion it wasn't even average.</div>,\n",

This time, he brought the house again with his next epic project, Avatar. \"Avatar\" talks the story about a paraplegic ex-marine, Jake Sully (Worthington), who after loosing his brother, gets a chance to head for Pandora on a unique mission. But, he needs to choose whether following his orders by Colonel Miles Quaritch (Lang) or protecting the planet he feels is his real home. \"Avatar\" was beyond amazing and i loved it! It totally leaves behind a message for protecting the environment from destruction. Its 3D was amazing. I mean, i watched the whole movie with my 3D glasses on and it felt like it was real, like i was really in Pandora with the others. Pandora is the total opposite of our world. Everything there is absolutely beautiful from every moment of the entire movie. I was stunned by the Hallelujah Mountains, floating in the sky. And the Avatar bodies and the Na'vi were really well done, especially Jake's avatar and Neytiri. Now, i been hearing around the internet that Cameron's gonna be making 2 sequels for Avatar, and i just wanna say that i can't wait to see the sequels and i hope they come out just as great and amazing as the first Avatar.<br/><br/>Perfect 10/10</div>,\n",

Somehow that makes up for it being probably the most overrated movie of all time.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it the animation was beautiful to watch; the artistry was outstanding; all of these it did win for. Technically it was incredible, but a good movie's gotta be more than just pretty.<br/><br/>And my sound-bite summaries above... they come from my impression of the trailer before I even watched \"Avatar\" - and I stand by them. However, I was happen to hear that when a friend of mine took her 14-year-old son to see it (her son who had never seen \"Dances With Wolves\" or \"Ferngully\"), he left the movie going on about how we mistreat our environment and the immorality of colonialism and conquest. And I'll admit - he's right. I'd seen this story a hundred times already, but this was his first; and it worked, \"Avatar\" got the lesson across in a way fit for a 14-year-old. And for that I give it credit.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Apparently my local theater was to good to keep showing the biggest movie in the world in their theaters. So for my mother's 50th birthday my sisters and I drove an hour and forty-six minutes to the next town to see it. They were showing the 3D version. I was skeptical in seeing it like that, but fortunately that vanished because I was blown away by the visuals. So were my family. However, story-wise if you've seen Pocahontas, Titanic, Fern-gully, The Last Samarui, and even Terminator you have seen this movie etc. God you have definitely seen this movie.<br/><br/>Story- In some very far off future the US military wants some god-like mineral on this alien planet called Pandora. Well of course the Navi,tall majestic looking blue people, ain't budging. So they send a wheelchair bound solider in as a Avatar(super technology mind-link to a doll that looks just like the Navi) to infiltrate and learn more about them. This is all to get them to move or else force will be used. Of course he falls in love with the people and it's princess. Tells them to fight his own blah, blah... Heard, and seen, it all before.<br/><br/>I swear I thought I was watching the live action version of Pocahontas in Fern-gully come to life. The problem with the story and dialog is that it's as cliché as the sun rising. The enemy soldier that just wants to blast Pandora out of the universe is a walking stereotype if I ever saw one. Then there's the velvetta induced speech by the lead character to the Navi. Also the lead villain to his troops has a cheese-ball one as well etc. It's like they had a tick counter with a list of clichés, and went to town with them on this whole movie.<br/><br/>I'm aware that there is nothing new anymore. I know that everything is pretty much a cliché/stereotype now. However, there are ways to go about it so that the viewer forgets that they have seen it all before. You won't forget that fact at all in this movie. At all. The movie wasn't even trying to be subtle. It was in your face. Get your tick counters ready.<br/><br/>Also this movie is full of unfortunate implications. I won't list them all. You'll be able to do that yourself when you see it just fine. One for example though is that the Navi can bond with the trees and the wild animals of Pandora. They can do this by sticking an intimate part of their body into an intimate part of their victim's. Then forcing the tree or creature to submit to their wills. Without even seeing the movie what does that sound like to you? Then when you actually see the act.. Yea implications indeed.<br/><br/>Visuals- The visuals were so good I would've given this movie a 10 just for that fact alone. However, my conscious won't allow me to do that lol. See this movie in 3D if you can. It is absolutely breathtaking. The world of Pandora is like every fantasy setting put together. It's all just a magical eye-gasm. Like I said it's pretty much Fern-gully come to life. That's not a bad thing. Not a bad thing at all.<br/><br/>I at first dragged my feet at going to see this movie because of the Navi being blue, catlike beings with huge anime eyes. However, once I saw them in the movie I came to realize they look beautiful like that, and go well with Pandora. Their height took me by surprise though. You won't get to see them by humans until the end and they are huge.<br/><br/>Bottom-line: You can enjoy this movie. Even if the title should have been called Avatar: The Cliché. The way to do it is leave your brain at the door. Just enjoy the visuals and the beautiful,realistic looking Navi. If you let in your logical detestment at seeing obvious stereotypes rolling around like dice, then you won't enjoy this movie. You'll pull yourself right out of it. I didn't want to leave when the credits rolled. I didn't even realize two hours had passed. I was so engrossed in it. Could it have been the graphics I didn't want to leave? Probably. However, since they are part of the overall package I bared with the whole movie.<br/><br/>There's no deep character development in this movie. There's no deep anything really. The dialog is a big chuck of cheese. The mineral that they wanted was more like an obvious plot device. The first time it's brought up is the last time. The characters are all one dimensional stereotypes etc. However,the movie did entertain me. Also as cliché and stereotypical as everyone was they were likable. So that's something. Also it at least had five passable movies to be cloned from. *Hmm maybe not Titanic. I think I'm the only person in the world that has never liked that movie. lol*</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Well, here it is.<br/><br/>James Cameron's project has been hyped to within an inch of its proverbial life over the years, what with the epic budget, alleged re-inventing of special effects and some admittedly underwhelming trailers full of conspicuously computer-generated blue elves. The question that's burning in everybody's mind leading up to its release this week is: Is it really that great? The answer: pretty much, yeah. But more on that in a bit.<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't heard the story, the plot revolves around paraplegic marine Sully (Sam Worthington), who's offered a second chance at life on the lush alien planet of Pandora. The humans on the planet are engaged in a war with the native population, blue humanoid warriors known as the Na'vi, over extremely valuable natural resources. To this end, a handful of scientists (led by a delightfully taciturn Sigourney Weaver) have created an \"avatar\" project where people control cloned Na'vi in order to get close to the tribes and work something out. Through a cruel twist of fate, Sully ends up controlling one such avatar and from there the story well and truly begins.<br/><br/>Now, where do I start with Avatar? The film's a lot of things, but it's obviously not perfect, and I'm not sure whether to address its flaws or good points first. Something tells me I'll go with the flaws first. It's hard to judge them too objectively - it all depends on just how tolerant you can be. I'd probably say the film's worst flaw also plays a huge part in defining just how good (or bad) the film is. I refer of course to the film's copious use of CGI characters. This is a problem that I think will depend on the viewer. Either you're going to find it horribly distracting the whole way through or get used to it after about five minutes. I reckon this is something that is up to every viewer to decide. Myself - I fall into the latter camp. Just as well, because that could very well be the major deciding point in how to judge the film, if only because Avatar is saturated with CGI. Not like that's a bad thing, as a lot of the CGI looks very flash. Avatar's look is pretty damned impressive, all things considered. Between the lush locations, slick gadgetry and veritable cornucopia of action available, I can hardly see how the film's abundance of CGI is a problem. It definitely aims high and hits its mark a lot.<br/><br/>With that main issue out of the way, the rest of the film manages to be considerably strong a lot of the time. Once the story gets going, it stays riveting for much of its lengthy runtime. It's well-written, even if one of the central metaphors seems a little too obvious (powerful corporation attacking harmless natives over valuable resources - not exactly subtle) and it managed to keep reasonably surprising all the way to the end. The acting was by and large good; Worthington doesn't exactly shine as the hero, but he performs reasonably well. The highlight is probably Weaver, although there's something to be said for Stephen Lang's battle-scarred colonel, who makes up for a general lack of character dimension with relative ease.<br/><br/>The real question remains as to just how great Avatar is. It's definitely an amazing epic in spite of its few flaws and relative lack of originality, so it's admittedly far from perfect. It remains by and large a visual extravaganza if nothing else, and should deserve consideration for one of the better blockbusters of the year (if not necessarily one of the best films). Depending on your expectations, it either wasn't quite as great as it could have been or it was far superior. If you had mixed expectations like I did, it's probably a mix of both. Avatar remains a technically great piece, a bit lightweight in parts, but overall pretty damned good. I'll definitely be checking this out in 3-D, anyway.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">James Cameron is an incredibly overrated director. \"Avatar\" is a terrible film. The story is completely unoriginal and totally ridiculous. The acting is less than stellar. The dialogue is absolutely cringe-worthy. The CGI is groundbreaking and the only reason this film ever received any praise. The film is thoroughly conventional. The script feels far more like a campy exploitation flick on Syfy rather than groundbreaking cinema.\"Avatar\" absolutely did not deserve to be competing at the Academy Awards against far superior films like Kathryn Bigelow's \"The Hurt Locker\" and Quentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\". I absolutely hated this film!!!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Review:<br/><br/>Say what you will about its similarities to 'Pocahontas' or 'Fern Gully' or 'The Smurfs,' James Cameron's 'Avatar' is a film experience like no other. If it does not win every category for special effects at this year's Oscars I will hang up my hat and sail for strange new lands with better awards for films because I will know the Academy has no bearings on reality. <br/><br/>'Avatar' is James Cameron's first film since his 1997 megahit 'Titanic.' In some respects, 'Avatar' is a return home for James Cameron. He is at home in the science fiction genre having delivered us such gems as \"Terminator\" (1984) \"Aliens\" (1986) \"The Abyss\" (1989) and \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" (1991). But while those films depicted grizzly and bleak predictions for humanity, 'Avatar' invests itself in the concept of natural beauty and the necessity to save it.<br/><br/>We never go to earth in 'Avatar' but we meet many earthlings – all Americans – and we are informed that earth has been stripped barren of its natural resources. Subsequently, a giant military operation has been set up on Pandora, a distant planet lush with forests and seas and floating mountains. The military and earth's corporations seek to obtain a resource conveniently called unobtanium (want to guess if the humans succeed in getting it?). Pandora is rich in the element. Unfortunately, a great source of unobtanium is located right under a giant tree where the peaceful indigenous people of Pandora, the Na'vi, live.<br/><br/>The Na'vi are nine foot tall, blue humanoids with tails and yellow eyes. They commune with the nature of Pandora and generally live like composites of every indigenous people you could see in a movie. The invading humans have found that the best way to learn and communicate with the Na'vi is by using avatars - genetically engineered Na'vi clones that are controlled by the mind of American soldiers from a remote location. The hero of 'Avatar' is Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex-marine who's asked to become an avatar after his twin brother, who initially was to be the avatar, dies.<br/><br/>The film begins with Jake Sully arriving on Pandora. He meets the lead scientists in the Avatar program, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver). She's a tough talking smoker scientist but she is one of the good guys, promoting the preservation of Pandora and the Na'vi culture. Jake also meets Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a military man who has eyes only for his missions. As you can probably guess, he's the bad guy.<br/><br/>Jake Sully is put into his Avatar and immediately thrilled to be able to walk and have the prowess of a Na'vi. On his first mission though he becomes separated from the group and finds himself at the mercy of Pandora's not-too-hospitable woodland critters. He is saved by a beautiful Na'vi princess named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). Soon Jake is integrated into Na'vi culture, practicing their many rituals and learning their language. He falls in love with Neytiri and after some love making decides the Na'vi way of life is not so bad.<br/><br/>Now, of course, the conflict is that Jake loves the Na'vi but he's in the service of a military that wants to destroy them and steal their unobtanium. Who will Jake side with - the war- like, profiteering humans or the peace loving blue people? Well, if you can't figure it out, I'll let it surprise you.<br/><br/>The special effects in 'Avatar' are why you should see this film. I have read that there are internet forums where people claim they feel depressed or even suicidal after seeing 'Avatar' because compared to Pandora, our world is a bit too dreary for them. At first I scoffed at this thought. I thought it was testament to how many people are living in a mindset a bit removed from reality. Now after seeing 'Avatar' I understand. The forests of Pandora are so wrought with detail you find yourself believing in it. The fantastical imagery are objectively absurd, but when rushed into the moments of their revelation, you become swept up in them. Particularly stunning are the floating mountain ranges, a geographical feature that's pure fantasy and yet might make sense in a region of reduced gravity.<br/><br/>\"Avatar's\" storyline is secondary to its effects. You can tell where James Cameron's interests were not primarily concerned with a new story. The narrative arc of an outsider becoming an insider and then fighting against the outsiders has been done many times before and it's been done better too. I found the characters to be underdeveloped and hard to sympathize with while the themes were overly developed to the point of hyperbole; anti-imperialism and preserving nature, while noble themes, are so in your face throughout the film, there is only one way to interpret 'Avatar.'<br/><br/>Usually a paragraph like the one preceding this would merit a bad review from me, but the visual effects of 'Avatar' are so stunning I can't help but give it a positive review. If you want pure escapism, and I mean pure, 'Avatar' is delicious and wonderful and that 160 minutes flies by, <br/><br/>Rating:<br/><br/>On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a \"Un Chien Andalou\" (1929)<br/><br/>Rationalization:<br/><br/>The vision will stick with me far longer than the story. In my mind, the story is secondary to the real story which is the fact that human innovation could produce such astonishing dreamscapes so comprehensively. James Cameron has always been a pioneer in the realm of special effects and this time he outdoes himself. Midway through 'Avatar' I believed in the Na'vi so thoroughly they were like real actors, occupying actual space. After Jar-Jar Binks and Golem, I was convinced that no CGI generated characters could never supplement actual actors or puppets\n",

You can pretty much link nearly every movie in one way or another if you are that anal about it.<br/><br/>What this movie is is visually stunning like nothing you have ever seen before, using ground breaking effects that had never been used before at the time and not many have surpassed it's technology since apart from maybe Tron: Legacy (2010) special effects.<br/><br/>Yes this movie is top grossing movie but then again ticket prices are still rising and even with inflation adjustments it is still well in the list of top movies ever. You need to compare this movies success with movie that wee around at the same time and the movies since and you will see none has come even close to the success this has had, so it is clearly an awesome and very successful movie.<br/><br/>Word gets around quickly when a movie is not up to expectations or is bad and people stay away from the cinema but they kept going and going with this one and after you have watched a movie like this and you can't get it out of your head, you want to tell everyone about it and you want everyone to see it, then you know it has had a big impact on you in a very good way.<br/><br/>I was totally engrossed in this, is is so beautiful and gorgeous to watch, the Na'vi's and Avatars look superb, Pandora looked so beautiful and i totally fell in love with Neytiri even though she is blue and 10 foot tall lol, she is absolutely gorgeous.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the prequel and the 2 sequels, i heard James Cameron has been waiting for the special effect technology to advance to be able to do what he has planned, so it is going to be amazing. Avatar's story is simple enough for the younger viewer to enjoy and is enough to hold the attention for adults too.<br/><br/>Anyway, i am not going to tell you the story of the movie as it has been told many times, i just wanted to say how ridiculous the haters are just hating for the sake of it and to let people know, though those with half a brain will already know that this is an amazing movie and of all the thousands and thousands of movies i have seen only a dozen have i rated a full 10 out of 10 and this is one of them and sits firmly in my top 10 best movies of all time.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'll try not to write spoilers, but the box was clicked just in case.<br/><br/>A lot of things are great in this movie. The most evident element is the CGI and imagery. The planet is a lush, incredibly beautiful, virgin forest during most of the film that centers in a tribe of Na'vi that lives in \"houstree\". The idea of hybrid beings acting as avatars for humans to interact with the natives was presented in a very clear way and introduced smoothly at the early stages of the movie. The message of the story, that of course is no literary classic, is very well presented and supported by gorgeous special effects is sure to sink in at least a couple of the minds of the audience, specially the youngest part. Acting is also pretty solid, from Sigourney Weaver (the unforgettable Ripley) to the slightly less experienced Worthington and Saldana who give their character a nice depth more than enough for the scope of the story. I can see a lot of right-winged minds laughing and demeaning the movie because it accurately reflects the absurdity of their views on life, the world and morals. Well, to those I tell that the world changed, and the selfish viewpoint held by this spectrum of people is, thanks God, no longer the absolute dominant one. This movie is certainly portraying that.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Viewing \"Avatar\" more than twelve years after my first experience, the thrills are largely undiminished. Maybe it's largely because this has been the roughest summer, climatologically, in my 76 year experience, here in Michigan. My former students in Idaho, Wyoming, California and other unfortunate states are experiencing some of the direst environmental threats because scientific warnings since the 70's were given lip service. In a different, but altogether, just as trenchant sense, the violations of native cultures by so called sophisticated elitists demonstrate that pride, contempt and hubris are more deeply entrenched enemies to the survival of the human race and the earth. In that sense, I strongly suspect that \"Avatar\" may be perceived as just as evocative, eloquent and tragic as we proceed into the ever encroaching future, which shows no favors to arrogance, ignorance and privilege.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Before I am completely discredited for a conterversial headline, the reader should know that I owe a lot of my love for film to Avatar. I saw Avatar when i was 10 and at the time it was by far the best and more creative thing I had ever witnessed. Now, having just turned 18, and having rated over 500 films on imdb (including 100 from the top 250) it still remains the best movie I have ever seen. <br/><br/>My reason for this is simple. Avatar has everything I could possibly want from a film. An engaging underdog plot which resonates with me on a spiritual level, ground breaking visuals, a romantic sub plot and action which is guaranteed to get anyones heart pumping. <br/><br/>Given Avatar is the most successful film of all time its not surprising it has encountered some fierce hate. Whether its because of its political undertones or its environmental message, thousands of users have rated Avatar 0/10 on imdb. More reasonable criticism of Avatar is related to its 'predictable' and 'lazy' plot. Having seen many films I can safely say I have never seen anything close to Avatar. If anyone has please tell me- I'm sure I'll love it!<br/><br/>Glad I got that out of my system.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar is James Cameron's child in waiting for longer than a decade. Twelve years since Titanic Cameron again delivers with a great science fiction epic with the usual tropes and clichés but somehow making it work. The film looks gorgeous and the planet Pandora will surely give nature pangs to many of us. It makes me wonder how much a great storyteller's skills matter- Everything and everyone was against Cameron and somehow, he has managed to deliver. If you haven't seen Avatar(how?) you should see it as soon as possible- this is a great science fiction adventure from a master filmmaker.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">There have been a number of paradigm shifts in the history of cinema. Dubbing gave us sound to replace a honky-tonk piano and quote cards, then the revolution that was colour completely changed the viewing experience...and now we're in the third shift from two dimensions to three.<br/><br/>Avatar in 3D is a visual delight and you can immerse yourself in the rendered world, relishing the detail and perspective (provided you focus where the camera has focused, otherwise that blurry object in the foreground remains a blur).<br/><br/>If we strip away the 3D and look at it in 2D, what we find is something that looks very much like a Pixar animation with some live action sequences threaded in here and there. As for the plot, the fundamentals are a well-worn story (as many have said, think \"Pocahontas\" in a SciFi/Fantasy setting).<br/><br/>In the final analysis, what we have is an enjoyable, comfortable movie that is certainly very good...but not great.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">My expectations going to see \"Avatar\" were low. I anticipated a special effects-driven, predictable action movie with little or no story. The visual effects are unquestionably impressive. The art design is beautiful, and the artistic concept for the terrain, flora and fauna of Pandora is consistent and appealing. The story is indeed predictable, at least superficially, sort of an extraterrestrial \"Dances With Wolves\" that may also serve as an allegory for the present-day US military and, especially, mercenary presence in the Middle East. But these things alone didn't make \"Avatar\" a box-office smash.<br/><br/>Director James Cameron utilizes long-time collaborator Sigourney Weaver to give the cast a credible, old-school science fiction foundation. As ever, Weaver delivers a solid and believable performance as Dr. Grace Augustine, the hardened and pragmatic chain-smoking scientist in charge of the Avatar project. The counterpoint to Weaver's Grace is relative newcomer Sam Worthington's Jake Sully. Worthington is recognizable to science fiction fans as the protagonist of the most recent Terminator movie. Jake Sully is a marine, the antithesis of a scientist.<br/><br/>With a damaged spine, Jake is confined to a wheelchair and can not afford corrective surgery. He agreed to come to Pandora with his twin brother, who was to participate in the Avatar project -- have his mind linked by machinery to a Pandora-indigenous humanoid body grown in a test tube and matched to his DNA. Jake's brother is killed before the film begins, and Jake agrees to takes his place (as they have identical DNA). Jake has really given up hope before the film begins. He can no longer be the only thing he has ever known or wanted to be: a marine.<br/><br/>Jake has, however, taken a step outside his cynicism and ennui by making the decision to take his brother's place -- he has agreed to enter into the unknown. This is the first step in what is to become the journey that defines him and is the real story in the film.<br/><br/>Humans are on Pandora to mine Unobtanium, a mineral concentrated underneath the home of the indigenous people, the Na'vi. The Avatar project was developed to allow humans to establish relationships with the Na'vi, breathing Pandoran air and looking like the Na'vi. It is hoped that the Na'vi will eventually agree to relocate in order to allow mining to begin. The corporate head of the mining project, portrayed effectively by Giovani Ribisi, is reminiscent of Paul Reiser's Carter Burke in Cameron's 1986 \"Aliens\" -- a wimpy minor bureaucrat bent on personal gain. He is assisted by the unscrupulous ex-Marine mercenary Colonel Miles Quaritch, given life by Stephen Lang.<br/><br/>Jake becomes involved with Na'vi native Neytiri, wonderfully voiced by Zoe Saldana, whose work in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films and \"Star Trek\" (2009) have already made her a familiar and respected actor. Neytiri is charged with teaching Jake the ways of the Na'vi, and Jake inevitably becomes enthralled with both Neytiri and the ways of the Na'vi, as he begins to understand the spiritual connection the Na'vi have with Pandora. This leads to war between the humans and the Na'vi, with Jake caught in the middle, ultimately choosing the Na'vi side.<br/><br/>I had fully expected all of this going into the theater. What I had not expected was finding my heart in my throat more than once, and feeling exhilarated most of the film's very quick 162 minutes. I was more than entertained by \"Avatar.\" I was moved.<br/><br/>Cameron masterfully uses stunning visual effects and incredible music as devices to achieve this effect on the viewer, but by themselves, these ingredients (although perhaps necessary) are not sufficient. What moved me was the transformation of Jake Sully.<br/><br/>Jake's decision to go Pandora is his first step toward becoming something more than he was (his openness to possibility is a step toward hope). He embraces the Na'vi training and is determined to prove himself -- another step (courage, determination, and willingness to become part of something larger than himself, which is a definition of spirituality). He admits his complicity in the plot against the Na'vi -- a third step (integrity). He realizes that he must do something extraordinary to win back the trust of the Na'vi -- riding the terrifying great dragon -- and this is a crucial step (not only bravery, but insight, which is translated into action, and faith). Ultimately, Jake is literally transformed, permanently departing his human body to become Na'vi. He becomes physically and spiritually integrated with the life force of Pandora.<br/><br/>Jake's transformation is assisted and encouraged by Neytiri. After Jake regains the trust of the Na'vi, Neytiri acknowledges this by saying \"I see you.\" Significantly, she repeats this later in the film, looking into Jake's human eyes. For the Na'vi, \"I see you\" means \"I acknowledge your existence.\" The real meaning for Jake is that Neytiri sees him for who he really is, and more importantly, who he can become. It is no coincidence that the song at the end of the film is called \"I See You.\"<br/><br/>The transformation illustrated so literally in \"Avatar\" is what each of us seeks in life -- a hopeful journey forward, through which we become more than what we were. The journey can be exciting, terrifying, and at times, can challenge us to go beyond what we believed we were capable of doing. Cameron's real achievement in \"Avatar\" is communicating that message without letting the audience know that he is doing it.<br/><br/>Especially at this time in history, with the economy depressed, world politics ominous and uncertain, and opportunities for the young seemingly absent, \"Avatar\" delivers a message of encouragement and hope in a medium familiar and acceptable to young adults. For this, Cameron deserves more than an Academy Award. He deserves the Nobel Prize.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In my opinion this movie is the best movie of the decade. Personally, it launched itself into my own personal top 5 of all time...maybe even number 1 after I reflect more on my experience. The movie is a magical experience. You will hear \"critics\" bash the plot as something that has already been done and/or reminds us of about 5 different movies in one. However, I reject these critics analysis because what movie can't you say that about? I once heard there are only around 56 stories in existence, and they keep being retold over and over again in different varieties and with different characters. So the fact that the story is one that is common to us (i.e. an outsider realizes that his own people are the evil and takes sides with aliens to vanquish his own, e.g. Dances with Wolves) doesn't bother me. I think the writing is excellent, the dialog superb, the special effects mind-blowingly amazing, and the story emotionally uplifting (i.e. it may bring a tear to your eye and force you to look at your fellow man a little differently regardless of the color of their skin or gender). To me this experience was beautiful and will be with me for a long time. I suggest this movie to EVERYONE, in IMAX 3D if possible.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">\"You should see your faces!\" I guess James Cameron knew how the audience would react to his Avatar. The movie-viewer interactive punch line, says it all. I was clearly warned; my eye balls would pop out and mouth would be left wide open- gasping at the splendor exploding before my eyes. And what a visual treat it turned out to be! None of the hoopla surrounding the movie deters its brilliance, and therein lies its popularity.<br/><br/>It was not the Hollywood's stupendous visual effects that floored me, (well it does have me knocked astound every year; from the time Spielberg brought those savage dinosaurs back from extinction) but it was the message the movie conveyed that delivered the real knockout-Save the planet, before it is all too late.<br/><br/>If a tree being felled with rocket missiles (the scene was heart wrenchingly cruel) can bring tears, I guess the movie makers have triggered the right neural networks that connects the heart and brain.<br/><br/>The story, which is, I presume, an excuse to give the movie-goers an out of this world experience (in Pandora), is profound (At this rate, I'm sure I'll fall short of abstract words to describe the movie's wonderfulness. There I go again, stop it). Humans being evil, (with exception to people like you and me, of course) plunder mother earth's resources and go after the unobtainable\n",
       "  sorry unobtanium. And in their quest, they ruffle the tails of the nature loving humanoids, belonging to the clan Navi. Ah, the same old good versus bad tale, twisted 360 degrees to picture perfection. The humans here, are the ruthless baddie guys, aliens and villains. (How profoundly appropriate and bulls eye is that?) And so the movie goes, with good triumphing over evil, all thanks to the human-turned-Navi, who betrays his own clan (the ever detestable human clan) and saves Pandora for the indigenous natives own keeps.<br/><br/>But, in between comes the illusionary surprises, one after the other, not allowing us time to awe at the scenes that pass by. I was afraid to blink my eye; afraid that if I did, I might miss out on some part of the extravagance (well, that line was pure, over the top, flattery. It makes me feel like I am being paid to write such cheesy lines).<br/><br/>Pandora's wildlife habitat was extremely impressive- there is this stegosaurus like cow which possesses a hammer like trunk, a black Siberian tiger with snake-like-whiskers that behaves like a T-Rex (rest assured, you'll like this kitty very much by the end of this film). And of course the dragon like flying beast that is available based on the individual's personal bravado. Sort of like the magic wand from the Harry Potter series- the wand chooses its master, the beast chooses the Na'vi it'll allow to ride/fly on its back.<br/><br/>The injustice extreme- of war and exploiting Mother Nature's resources; the other extreme of goodness- to live in harmony with nature,is what I'll take away with me from the movie. Mother goddess Eywa, Pandora's version of Mother Earth, in the end, brings about the much needed balance to sustain life. I foresee- that is exactly what is going to happen on earth. The human races destruction is inevitable; Mother earth will spell her doom soon to ensure the survival of life on planet earth.<br/><br/>Enough raving about a prophetical movie that has racked the moola, shouldn't I be do something more productive than seeing it and typing this; say, saving the planet, for instance.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I saw the masterpiece \"Avatar\", an epic movie from James Cameron, some time ago over an internet site and some days later also a second time in cinema. It was seriously the best film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The plot is rather simple for a film which is almost three hours long, but you really can feel whats going on in the inside of the characters. Acting isn't really important in this film because most of the film is made by technology, but the acting which is done is really nice. The music always fits perfectly to the mood of the film. The best part next to the plot is of course the mind blowing use of technology. They used the relatively new 3-D technology like they've been working with it for ages.<br/><br/>As we know today, \"Avatar\" broke a lot of records in film history, 14 nominees for Oscars, 33 other winnings, which show that this film is definitely a masterpiece in the history of cinema and shows whats possible these days with our technology.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar was the most talked about and hyped movie of the season. I watched the Oscars and wondered why it did not get Best Picture or Best Director and also why it got NO awards at the BAFTA's in the U.K. When I rented the DVD it became clear as to why it mysteriously didn't capture awards yet was the darling of critics and viewers alike. In praise of Avatar---it is visually stunning, exciting and mesmerizing and should be seen on that merit alone. Like Disney's Fantasia and Star Wars---it is groundbreaking for its time and a must see. The problem lies in the storyline. It seems to have used other hit movies to create a a visually stunning hybrid with a contemporary ecological message. It rips off the Matrix, Jurassic Park but its main storyline is Dances With Wolves. So much so that it ruined the movie for me. I knew the entire plot within the first half hour once I got wind of this. So its lipstick and a tutu on a pig. Great entertainment and fun for 3D freaks but tedious overall. I much prefer Dances With Wolves.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Many years ago a rather obscure science fiction writer, Poul Anderson, wrote a seminal science fiction novella entitled \"Call Me Joe.\" In this novella, the main character is a bitterly unhappy paraplegic who is given the job of mentally synthesizing with an artificially created being in order to settle and develop a planet rich in resources but otherwise dangerous, poisonous, and violent. At the end of the novella, Mr. Anderson posits that science has now found a place and a job for otherwise unusable cripples which gives them new bodies and new lives, and thus a valuable place in society. While Avatar takes this particular concept to a different place from a slightly different angle, the basic idea of paraplegics or other types of cripples being given a new lease on life by synthesizing their mental capabilities with those of another creature, whether Mr. Cameron admits it or not, is Poul Anderson's, and for Mr. Cameron not to acknowledge his debt to this outstanding writer is immoral. I would expect as a minimum that Mr. Cameron would let his admirers know that while he is a great director, he took his idea from an even greater and more creative source.</div>,\n",

Was it the best movie and deserved to make 2 billion dollars in box office....not at all. I don't understand why many people were so interested in this movie. Was it because Cameron's Titanic, one of the best movies ever made, plus and amazing directer was also directing this movie. Well, it doesn't really fall into those hands. Movies are about the story, and what makes you interested. I liked it, but some parts were slow. Cameron, you need to step up your game, not with a movie like this, and don't put out Titanic in 3D, that makes me think that you're poor again.<br/><br/>After all, James Cameron's film Avatar was an crumpled up piece of paper with an amazing drawing on it...showing that the movie is okay.</div>,\n",

How many movies have non original stories and we still watch them and enjoy them. Yes the idea of the story in itself has been told many times, but when it has been told it's normally been met with approval (dances with wolves, last samurai, Pocahontas, etc etc etc), but the world that James Cameron has created is incredible. It's not my favorite movie but it definitely gets undeserved hate from people that have jumped on the anti avatar bandwagon. Just appreciate it for what it is. A retelling of a story that we all know and have seen before in a completely original world. Ya the story is predictable... so what. It's visually incredible. Don't be swayed by band wagon haters. It's the keyboard hero culture that we now live in.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I was in awe of the world Cameron created and was spellbound. I didn't care that the storyline was somewhat predictable or that some of the graphics weren't in focus. I ignored the \"message\" about genocide, greed and Earth rape (all worthwhile messages but I really go to movies primarily to be entertained). And I succeeded in surrendering to a wonderful 3D experience, until the last half hour of inessential violence. It was over the top and so unnecessary. There were better ways to play out the conflict, ways that would have been satisfying. Also, the bad guy was so annoying. Yes, we are supposed to hate bad guys and want them to meet their maker, but I didn't care what happened to him--I just wanted him out of the movie. I recommend seeing the movie in 3D for the beauty of the imaginary planet and its inhabitants. But only people who enjoy long drawn out scenes of gratuitous violence will leave feeling the end wasn't designed for cheap thrills.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Where to start about this one, first let's just say that I would recommand to see this movie for the extremly impressive special effect. I saw this movie twice in IMAX 3D and it was a very good experience.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the story. Well it's basically dances with wolves in space with giant Smurfs and that's pretty much it. The script is extremly unoriginal, no twist, no suprise, nothing, it couldn't be more predictable.<br/><br/>To me this movie show exactly what's wrong about science fiction, action etc movie these day. We have a lot of remake, reboot etc. Or this: a new movie with a stolen script.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I just saw the film today in IMAX 3-D. Cameron has an intrinsic understanding of what film can be. People who criticize the story (or lack of one) and the superficial characterizations are missing the point. Film is a visual medium first and foremost. It tell it's story through pictures not words. Filmed science fiction has been notoriously hard to do well because generally our imagination can't catch up with the authors. For the first time I felt like I was truly transported to another place and time which is what the best films do. The 3-D was seamless and unobtrusive and the cgi ranks as some of the best I have ever seen. Interestingly enough when Star Wars came out everyone called it groundbreaking because of the visual effects. But it's story was no better than avatar's. Yet 32 years later it is still a classic ranked as one of the greatest films ever made. Why? Because it does what films are supposed to do brilliantly. It transports you and enthralls you and draws you into it's make believe world. Cameron's films have never been known for their subtlety but for being stunning visual experiences. Avatar redefines what film can be. Seeing it in any other format than IMAX you will be doing yourself a disservice. This is one of the best films of the year.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar does not seem to be a movie that is suited to the cynic as audience (!). What of Ehwa (Gaia?) in a distant planet, an indigenous people with lifestyle and roots in the bounty of nature around them, their inevitable conflict with the human race and its endless quest for resources – this is all schmuck, says the cynic. There is a been-there done that aura about the movie – whether it echoes the indigenous tribes and fragile ecosystem of the Brazilian (and a dozen other) rainforests, or whether the unlimited greed for mineral resources brings to mind America's global warmongering in search of oil, it seems that the core of the movie is drawn around a rehash of all-too-familiar elements and the fact that these elements are of course finding increasing resonance in an increasingly aware world does not take away from the fact that the core of the movie is somewhat unimaginative. But what is undeniable is the sheer quality of the graphics and the overall cinematography – the attention to detail and the sheer quality and complexity of the visual imagery bring to mind Jurassic Park – another genre-defining milestone in the use of technology by Hollywood. This is a movie that is likely to be a resounding commercial success in the short to medium term, but on a more measured inspection both critics and the public may find it wanting</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I'd heard a lot of hype about Avatar, about its innovative technology and groundbreaking special effects, about all the anticipation, about the strong reviews and very strong opening weekend and Golden Globe nominations, and as much as I was intrigued, as much as I was wanting to see it, I was a little apprehensive. More often than not, hyped-up movies disappoint me, or at least underwhelm me. But this time, the hype was right. And this is one hell of a movie.<br/><br/>True to the hype, the special effects are astonishing. And the 3-D used in the film was spectacular. Visually, it's one of the most amazing films I have ever had the privilege to see.<br/><br/>Now, some people had indicated prior to my viewing of the film that the story and dialogue were a little weak. While I won't say it was the best-written movie of all time, and while I wouldn't hold my breath for a Best Screenplay nod at the Oscars, it was far from a bad script. At least, it didn't distract from the movie and leave a bad taste in the my mouth. Whatever it lacked in originality it more than made up for with the way it sucks you into its world and takes you along for a ride.<br/><br/>And its world is well worth being sucked into. Such depth, such sheer creativity, in the world and its ecosystem, is unequalled. As alien as Pandora is, by movie's end, it seems perfectly natural, and the beauty and grandeur of its scenery and life-forms is staggering.<br/><br/>Finally, the acting was competent, and \"right\" enough not to distract, though, again, Oscars are unlikely. The music is another matter; I expect Horner will at least get a nomination for his powerful score.<br/><br/>Basically, all the individual pieces of this film are well-crafted, and they all seem to fit together into one tapestry that surpasses just about everything else in the movies of the past several years. I won't say it was 100% flawless, but whatever flaws it did have were minor, and completely shadowed by the magic of this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and will eagerly await its DVD release. Highly recommended.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Avatar has to be the most over-hyped, underwhelmed movie in the last 10 years. I've come to expect hyperbole from James Cameron but Avatar takes the cake. What a huge mistake. This movie deserves every negative comment and review written. Clearly Cameron's ego got the better of him in this depressing drivel. Over acted, over special effected, and over done. I'm sure it was over-budget too. Never has motion capture been given such a bad rap as in Avatar. If this is the future of movie making then I'll be staying home to watch reruns of the Andy Griffith show on TVLand. And then I heard today Cameron learned nothing from the baby seal clubbing he got from the critics of Avatar and is now making a sequel. Wow! It just goes to show that if you make half a billion $ on a 2h30m soap opera called Titanic there is no where else to go but down to the bottom.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">After watching Avatar I noticed the Idea of a moon on a Jupiter like planet. The plot is great but Ill reason with that later. Since science intrigues me, after watching the first Star Wars, it actually becomes believable. Star Wars had space models, something you see in real life Nasa exploration with the exception of no zooms to view the star perspective and a lot of simulated sounds. Already has interplanetary ion engines and simulated sound through technology been invented so models are still the best in my view. You know, life on other worlds, interplanetary travel, and sound simulated in space. I didn;t really get it, being not such a huge fan of science-fiction fantasy to much. Well on to Avatar's 'science fiction believability' <br/><br/>1.) If a moon were to have life it would need a force to create a direct impact where two asteroids collide or something. These asteroids would need another force to sustain its rotation, seeing how it would have to be in a life zone (like earth is except earth uses bi-polarization eg light and magnetism, push and pull) moons use a centrifugal force. There for it would need a way to keep it in orbit. A bigger body, although bodies like Jupiter do expel heat at 88 degrees that would be fake because temperatures are far greater on stars, which heat planets. OK now that that's out of the way its science fiction turned into fantasy, or fantasy sci-fi. The atmosphere would be very thick if giants ever existed, much like in prehistory so floating mountains would be a problem. If life ever existed on a moon it would be far smaller. This is fiction definitely fiction.<br/><br/>2.) The computer graphics are fantastic and its a first to directly implement it with people, although 2012 was close. Will it be more useful than models? Or say Star Wars realism? No sorry. CGI is cool, just not realistic and this CGI is awesome.<br/><br/>3.)The plot is great and worth watching, the only good part about the film. If somehow, people were a greater species say like Atlanteans than maybe it would be believable. But those people are far long dead like the dinosaurs or are us in a way. So no its not. Depicting the marines as say Nazis is not a bad idea...because well they ARE in a way. The fact is, these 'Nazis' would be forced to take land if say there land is overrun or starved. That's life. The Americans did it to the Indians, the Germans to the Russians (or maybe vice-versa? who knows), and to the 'other Indians' most represented as Pakistanis except over time they really did die out in America:P It took hundreds of years. You either move when something happens or you don't. Natures just better at doing it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">***May contain spoilers*** <br/><br/>Where to begin? Hmm. OK, well, take away the CGI from this film and there is actually very little left: hackneyed plot, average acting and some utterly cringeworthy scenes. During one scene in particular (there were blue people waving their arms around in a crowd) my girlfriend and I actually burst out laughing in the cinema. From that scene onwards, any suspension of disbelief was suspended.<br/><br/>I was so disappointed with James Cameron after seeing this. Frankly I expect much better.<br/><br/>This film is probably OK for young people up to the age of ~18, and perhaps adults who are a little soft-headed, the rest shouldn't waste their time.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Gosh, I'm sorry, but I give Mr. Cameron two stars for originality. The computer animation was incredible, but without an original story, it just doesn't cut the mustard. Captain John Smith from Pocahontas, mixed with Lt. John J. Dunbar of Dances with Wolves, add a splash of Tom Cruise's Captain Nathan Algren of The Last Samurai, all make up the \"military man becomes flower child\" Jake Sully. If there are unique elements to this story from the others I've mentioned, they are few or at least insufficient to be compelling. This is \"white man with superior fire power destroys peaceful, earth loving natives\" all over again. It's not new, it's not original, and ridiculously predictable. In all fairness, there isn't much you can do that's completely original these days, but we've beaten this dead horse into mush! In the end, I was only mildly entertained. I saw it only once and haven't purchased or rented it since it came out on digital media. It certainly doesn't deserve top 250 on IMDb, at least not for the story.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Initially conceived in 1999 as Cameron's follow up to Titanic, Avatar was put on hold when Cameron realized the technology did not exist yet to support his vision. Over the course of the next decade, Cameron created much of the technology he needed to make this movie possible. In 2002, Cameron watched The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and through the character of Gollum realized that his vision was finally possible. Twelve years have passed since the release of James Cameron's Titanic, will his new film prove that Cameron is still \"King of the World\"? Much has been made of Cameron's Avatar long before it's release. Hailed as a revolution in 3D and CGI technology, Avatar holds a lot of expectations, not the least of which is the fact that the budget and marketing for this film add up to approximately half a billion dollars, making it the most expensive movie ever made. Of course, Cameron has been here before. Titanic cost $200 million to make, the largest budget for a feature film at the time, and just when it looked like it was going to goose that laid the rotten egg it proceeded to make $1.8 billion worldwide, making it the highest grossing film of all time. Cameron's also not new to the idea of revolutionizing the world of film with almost every movie he makes: with The Abyss he had the first all digital water effect, with Terminator 2 he had the first CGI character with realistic movement, and so on. Can lightning strike yet again? I'm generally someone who's adverse to using all caps for anything, but: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE!!!!! Also don't wait for it to come to DVD or to a TV station near you. Why, you ask? Because this movie is a movie that has to be seen the way it was intended to truly get the fully immersive experience. I watched the trailers on TV and online, and none of that compared to seeing the film in theaters in 3D. With Avatar, Cameron has truly outdone himself. When District 9 came out, I raved about the CGI effects in that movie, but Avatar is a whole other monster. With Avatar you truly cannot tell where the CGI begins and reality ends and vice versa, and on top of that it is the most beautiful film I've ever seen, CGI or otherwise. On top of that, Cameron's new 3D cameras create an experience that is in no way uncomfortable. No headaches and no motion sickness for those of you who suffer from that sort of thing. Instead, you get a highly immersive experience that leaves you begging for more (which is saying something, considering the film's run time is 162 minutes) and wanting to return when you leave.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of reviews lately that talk about the film having a weak script with too many clichés and one dimensional characters. What you really get, in my opinion though, is old school story telling with a message, even though the message is drowned out in special effects and action. The script moves quickly, there is no downtime, but you also never feel like the pacing is off, or that it's moving too fast. Cameron has built a complete world, we don't just see characters and action, but we see complete eco systems, and are introduced to many characters. While the entire cast is amazing, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully and Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch are the real standouts here. Sam Worthington creates a character that you feel for, and through his progress from pawn to leader is truly believable and heartfelt. Stephen Lang, on the other hand, gives us a character that starts off just trying to do his duty, but eventually becomes a character on par with Sergeant Barnes from Platoon or Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>I purposefully chose not to mention anything about the plot for this movie. I think this movie is going to be the revolution of movies that Cameron believes it's going to be. I've seen reviewers compare it to The Wizard of Oz (the movie to truly lead the color revolution) and King Kong (the 1933 version, which revolutionized special effects), and I wholeheartedly agree. I still can't completely fathom what I just saw, and will probably see it at least one more time on the big screen if not more. Anyone who's into film, the tech of film, or just wants to keep up with where film is going in the future should see this film. On top of that, this movie touches on so many different genres (SciFi, fantasy, romance, war films, drama, etc.) that it will appeal to almost everyone. Once again, James Cameron is \"King of the World\"! 5/5</div>,\n",

To the extreme detail, and at the same time make it move, live, include 3D scenes that hit...<br/><br/>Also I'm quite picky, but could not say any flaw in this film. (E.g. this year's Star Trek would have been a perfect movie if they picked a good composer...) Especially with Cameron on board who had past tendency to sacrifice important elements, like plot -- just to show some planned scene (think the ending of Aliens, with the unnecessary stupid shooting in the chamber few minutes before the nuke explosion -- just to let the queen free and fight...) <br/><br/>I suggest everyone to go and watch it in movies in 3D while it is on, I doubt that any home equipment will be able to reproduce the experience without losing too much.</div>,\n",

Because it is a very fine film; it is absolutely true to his career; and it should have been a great film, a stupendous one. But I have to say that it ended up workmanlike rather than brilliant. The high score I give for the graphics and animation work; totally seamless, totally immersive and a fantastic spectacle. As many other people have said, I can't give it for the plot, script or characters because they have been done a lot of times already - not necessarily better, but at least as well. If I want to be reminded that colonial genocide is bad... actually it's not the sort of thing anyone needs reminding about. Having admired the look of the thing (and I really really like the look of the thing) I have to repeat that the film resembles Total Recall in that it should have been a much more nuanced and subtle examination of the alien culture the humans were trying to destroy. Just as Total Recall should have been (and nearly was) a careful look at whether our identity can be separated from our memories and how far tampering with memory affects identity, so there were an awful lot of questions about Pandora that should have been answered better. Of course,it is a world carefully designed for the purposes of the film. That raises a problem in that it looks like a created artefact. Consider the largely unexplained ability of most of the important lifeforms to form this bond with each other and with the local vegetation. How is that the product of anything except intelligent design? (Babel fish, anyone?) But no-one takes that and runs with it. It's kind of an elephant in the room. Nor do we get any explanation of the effect of this \"bonding\" on the mind of a human. Nor is there any feeling that this really is a low-gravity world. Things seem to accelerate downwards at one gee. Minor flaws, but never mind that. I hope that people too young to have read the science fiction referred to in this film will go and find it; Harry Harrison's Deathworld series, John Varley's Gaia books, and for a rather cute and patronising way of dealing with First Contact H Beam Piper's Little Fuzzy books. For a more domestic way of having indigenes teaching humans a lesson, take Elizabeth Moon's Remnant Population. But also enjoy the film!</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I've seen a great many movies in five decades of life in this \"age of media\", and I've seen quite a pile of IMAX 3D features as well. Within the latter domain, this movie is really nothing special. I mean, yeah, it's VERY cool if you've never seen live-action IMAX 3D before. All around me during the screening I could hear the new initiates in the audience experiencing the giddy delight that strikes so many of us on our \"first time.\" But what was very apparent to me as a seasoned IMAX aficionado was the difference between the live-action scenes and computer-generated ones. Though still spectacular by virtue of the sheer screen size, CGI 3D still has a long way to go to rival what IMAX cameras can do.<br/><br/>That said, the tale itself is simply wonderful. Yes, as other reviewers have remarked, it's an old and well-worn storyline. But then, as many film reviewers have pointed out time and again, there are really only a couple of dozen different basic story lines in existence to begin with, so if you've been around the block a few times as I have, they all look pretty familiar in one way or another. However, what sets Avatar apart is that it an essential parable for our times . . . and if you are TRULY willing to look and listen, you will find it resonating within you at a level that goes far, far beyond the messaging of messaging of even the best of Hollywood's standard film-fare. Cameron has a way of reaching to an emotional depth in the sapient viewer's soul that nobody else in cinema comes close to. And upon this power he overlays a subtle yet vital message to which we simply must pay attention. For that reason alone, Avatar is an absolute must-see for all.</div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">8/10 <br/><br/>I saw it normally without the 3D or IMAX 3D unfortunately, but it was still a great experience. Mostly everything about it was at the least beyond the ordinary. First off, the visuals were amazing, just like people say. The CGI was real, and the planet itself looked so lively with its colors and animals and scenery, and was developed nicely. I think the ideas behind all their plants and trees and how they reacted was pretty cool. I mean it's not the first time great effects have been done (like 2012 was awesome as well) but this was a large scale planet, bigger than 2012 I think. <br/><br/>The acting and character development was great, and Sam Worthington did a good job. The Parker operation leader did a nice job too I think, as a business man. All the others acted well and supported it with their sides of the story. The characters were showed in more depth than a lot of movies combined these days, and a lot of the time from the movie was devoted to just seeing the characters and their emotions, mostly with Jake Sully though. Their logging was a good thing to show. <br/><br/>And with the story, it's not too original for us, but this movie started 10 years ago, so things have changed. At near 3 hours, it was well paid for, and there was a balanced amount of action, romance, thinking, and more around.<br/><br/>The camera views were fun, and reminded me of Star Trek, similar movement. The movie might cause controversy over the different sides of the people in the film and how it ends, but it's an overall great movie that will be remembered forever and ever.</div>,\n",

The world of Pandora (which like the box promises everything but delivers nothing to all but a few) is incredibly real , the facial expressions of the digital actors flawless. The fauna and flora so convincing you believe its real yet so alien , a masters vision of a strange world that may be .

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is another of those films that separate the 'entertainment' seekers from the movie fans.<br/><br/>Although I must admit to having enjoyed Avatar, in places, the simple, inescapable truth is that are too many ridiculous elements at play in the film for it to be taken seriously. It may take you an hour, a day, a week or even a month to realise this, but hopefully you'll come to this conclusion at some point.<br/><br/>Here are the facts: Americans (why is it always Americans? There are still humans on Earth from other countries aren't there?) invade alien world with an uninspiring name (Pandora - where have we heard that name before?) which is populated by creatures who, remarkably, have evolved to look almost completely humanoid. What a lack of imagination! Even the wildlife are simple alterations on what we have on Earth, or from popular mythology.<br/><br/>All the characters are one dimensional, and fall neatly into 'goodies' and 'badies' camps immediately. There are no shades of grey in this world - that would be too complicated for the popcorn-munchers.<br/><br/>The plot is predictable, which is such a crime to the progression of movies, but is even more so here, considering the way this movie was being touted. The next step in cinema? You mean, computer game graphics, and no story? I think we've already had that, James.<br/><br/>Yes, it is rousing, at times, and there are occasionally good ideas, such as the physical connection between native and animals, but they are swamped in 'by the numbers' colouring-in sets and scenes that should only appeal to kids and those who seek only bright lights and loud noises.<br/><br/>The story itself is just a riffing on the native Americans' treatment at the hands of the invading white men, which has been mirrored more effectively elsewhere. It's also depressing to see the natives win on Pandora, simply to remind ourselves that this is just a movie, and that it was the invaders who won back in the world of reality.<br/><br/>One of the sourest points for me, though, is the fact that the movie was driven by vast sums of money and a hyped marketing strategy - surely two elements that do not sit well with the morality of the tale, or the native people out to stop a huge, greedy corporate organisation.<br/><br/>There's more to be said, but I've got a feeling it's been well documented now.<br/><br/>I, too, fell for the hype, so on that front the movie is a huge success.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">First, I'd like to say that you should be reading all these comments and reviews later, not before. Right now you should be seeing the movie, and you will not regret it, I promise. This isn't meant to be a review as such, instead it is a response to the very few people that mistakenly mark Avatar as having a cliché and dense storyline.<br/><br/>I think one of the main reasons why we feel Cameron should have done a better job with the storyline is that he wrote this like 10 years ago, am I not right? I guess he just figured he'd use the storyline from back then, but in the meantime, there's been dozens, maybe hundreds of movies all using a storyline much like this one, because after all, it's what sells movies. I still don't consider this storyline \"bad\" though, because while it may have been done and said many times, this is the best iteration of it I've ever seen, and I expect that had this movie come out in 2001, I wouldn't even notice; I'd just call it epic all around.<br/><br/>Besides, you can't try to compare this movie to some super realistic one, everything in it is drawing you into something very different from the reality that we live in. The GI Joe-like badass Marine dudes, their toy-like hovercraft and mechs, the blue furries, the overthetop lines, the overdone emotions that nobody in real life would have, the glow in the dark plants, the 6 legged creatures, the 3D..... All of these elements have been done over and over, but where this differs is that Cameron combines them all into something that just works. The people that are nitpicking on them aren't really nitpicking on the Avatar movie, because everything here is done splendidly. They're unknowingly picking on all the movies that did these things, but badly, and ruined us of these things forever.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with naming something \"unobtanium,\" or having a GI Joe for your nemesis character, or having a 10 foot tall super hot humanoid-with-a-tail character, or a Pocahontas storyline; it's just that when we see those, we jump on all the failures related to them, and then somehow we think it was Avatar's fault.<br/><br/>Anyways, enough justification, just go see it.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">First things first. Is Avatar deserving of the unrelenting hype? Its status as the highest grossing movie of all time? Could ANY movie truly live up to that billing? Probably not, but in terms of sheer scope of the visuals and storytelling, it is easy to see why James Cameron's Avatar became the phenomenon it is.<br/><br/>With a rumored budget of more than 300 million, there's never any question that the visual effects are the main star here. I might run out of adjectives rather quickly in going into detail why this movie is an easy 10/10 in the visual department. Comparisons with the original Star Wars are in this way warranted. Cameron has raised the bar on film-making in a lot of the same ways George Lucas did back in 1977. For perhaps the first time, I actually forgot I was watching CGI characters interact for most of the movie. The motion capturing was as close to perfect as I've seen. The environments were incredibly immersive. The colors were incredible. There was so much detail put into it, so much going on in the background, but it never overdid it in a way that movies such as the Star Wars prequels did. Cameron does understand the concept of letting a shot breathe. You might see critters or other such things in the background, but the shots never get distracting. It's definitely impressive how he created a whole world that lives before us, right down to the grass, plants, animals, and atmosphere. I could go on and on, but simply put, this movie looks freaking beautiful.<br/><br/>A lot has been said about the story. Yes, it's in no way original. Yes, it seems pieced together from other films. There's a lot of Dances With Wolves, there's some Ferngully style environmentalism, there's things I immediately recognized as being taken from The Matrix, Aliens and Star Wars. The lead in to the jungle areas of Pandora were just like the tour into Jurassic Park. But take a step back and consider: Is Dances with Wolves a better experience than Avatar? Is Ferngully presented in a way that's even half as effective? This film does aspire to be a classic like the other films mentioned, and I'm not convinced it's really so different, at least in terms of storytelling. Avatar lacks some of the heart in terms of the character development and personalities, but the overall story honestly didn't bother me at all. Sometimes taking a familiar concept can be OK as long as it's improved upon. It's a story we've heard before, but in this case the way it is presented never felt too forced or cliché for my taste. That being said, it's too bad it wasn't a bit more original. At least in Star Wars we had light sabers and the force and all that, the fact that Avatar lacks it's own spin in this way does hold it back from being a masterpiece. <br/><br/>The other issue I had with the story was that we seemed to join it midway in, with little explanation for the motivations of the characters based on what had happened before. This seems to be a deliberate decision by Cameron, and I'm not asking for flashbacks or anything, but there must have been a way to convey to the audience what was at stake a little better. Because of this, and the way the film spends the first 90 minutes basically showing us pretty pictures, the plot and characters don't really get truly engaging until the half way point. Around the time the romantic subplot kicked in, we were in full gear, and I had very few problems from this point on.<br/><br/>The cast in Avatar was a saving grace in my opinion. Sam Worthington was a good choice for the everyman main character, and Sigourney Weaver was a good choice as someone that has screen presence. Also, I was very happy to see Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore, as I've always been a fan of their supporting roles in the past. They nailed the casting across the board, which did a considerable job of making up for the otherwise less than fleshed out characters. There was a few moments of cheesy acting, but they did a good job with what they had to work with and succeeded at making me care about them by the end of the film. <br/><br/>There are many that thought Avatar was heavy handed in it's obvious messages. Knowing most of these going in, I was not bothered in the slightest. For a film with this long a running time, I was pleasantly surprised with how fast it went by. The pacing was done well and I was very thankful that the action didn't just drag on forever with no creativity put into it. <br/><br/>Avatar is quite the experience. It deserves to be seen by virtually anyone, and for that, it's hard to argue with the fact that there is a lot of hype around it. A few aspects hold the film back from achieving the masterpiece status that it tries for, but it's about as close as it gets in my eyes without crossing that line. If only for the innovation on display, and the way it plays as kind of a greatest hits if you will of many classic movies that I have loved my whole life.With the proper additional material this could easily rise above that, so I will eagerly keep my eyes on the extended version when the time comes. In the meantime, suffice to say you won't find me in the camp of people that won't continue to enjoy Avatar as a beautifully done adventure.<br/><br/>9/10</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">We've all heard the hype - the \"be-all and end-all\" of filmmaking, the movie of the decade, brilliant, stunning, yada yada yada. Here are my two cents: I wouldn't necessarily call it the greatest movie Cameron has ever done, but I think it was still a d**n good movie! People who go on and on and on about character and plot development need to take a chill-pill and stick to Sundance. I don't watch movies to be tormented or reminded about how much the world sucks - I watch movies to be ENTERTAINED. And Avatar entertained me greatly!!! I thought the characters were beautiful and very real. The CGI work, naturally, was completely breathtaking. There were moments when I forgot that I was looking at something that didn't actually exist.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some similarities to certain other films (which will be rammed down your throat ad nauseum if you read any of the other reviews on this site), but if you think about it, isn't that pretty much the basis of any Nicholas Evans movie? Or, for that matter, any romance/action/comedy/drama movie ever made? Repetition doesn't make it bad - telling an old story in a new way is part of what makes film (IMO) so great.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not, but I'm marking it as one, just in case: I want to address all the folks who were going on and on and ON about the \"unobtainium\" and saying how lame it is to call it that. Clearly, you people haven't done your homework. \"Unobtainium\" is a staple of sci-fi pop culture - a humorous term used mainly in the aerospace industry. It describes a material that is perfect for an application, but does not exist, is extremely expensive, or violates the laws of physics. It is also a general concept term used by sci-fi enthusiasts for any fictional substance that is needed to build a certain device that is crucial to the plot of a sci-fi story. (It is also referenced in certain other movies and video games.) Don't bash something unless you know the history behind it.<br/><br/>Bottom line - GREAT movie! Well worth seeing! Boo to the critics - I never listen to them, anyway. I thought Million Dollar Baby was a complete waste of film...but that's a story for another day. ;)</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar. Another exploitive attempt to rape Americans of their money, culture and dignity.<br/><br/>I would have walked out had I not been there with a group.<br/><br/>The story was completely predictable, clichéd and boring. The action was generic and predictable. The characters flat and predictable. The CG and 3d boring and predictable. Did I mention this movie was boring and predictable.<br/><br/>Boring and Predictable... and probably perfect for American movie goers. I know people will give this movie all the predictable praise. Any movie, no matter how bad, will do good in America if given enough hype and explosions.<br/><br/>This is the generic filth that leaves the country flat and unimaginative.<br/><br/>\"Why would people watch that?\" \"Because its on TV!\"</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The turning point in the life of \"Avatar\" as a blockbuster was when it lost the Best Picture Oscar to \"The Hurt Locker.\" Not that it lost potential movie consumers, far from it, but by not winning, it was deprived of bragging rights for posterity.<br/><br/>In the run-up to the 2009 Academy Awards night, the two films were locked in a David- and-Goliath publicity contest the likes of which are becoming more and more of an annual event. When the peers of directors James Cameron and Kathryn Bigelow, his ex-wife, chose the $11 million film over his $300 million digital epic, the irony was not lost on us.<br/><br/>It's amusing to describe the movie's main conflict in biblical terms because the film's Davids are 3 meters tall (10 ft.). They are the Na'vis, a tribe of blue-skinned, yellow-eyed humanoids on some planet Pandora. On the other hand, the Goliaths are an army of Earthlings from the military-industrial-complex bent on strip-mining the planet's valuable rock, artlessly called unobtainium. You know the story, how the mission's lead avatar infiltrates the noble tribe, falls for their feisty warrior princess then switches over to the side of the soon-to-be oppressed.<br/><br/>That could well be \"Avatar's\" biblical dimension, a call to us, the masters of nature by default, to conserve whatever pristine treasures we have left. But short of lecturing, it lightly couches its message in a morality play that melds science fiction, war story, action and romance.<br/><br/>It is a story laced with youthful fantasizing. The corporate exploiters and their mercenaries menace the peace of Pandora, an otherworldly ecological Paradise. At its center is the mystical Tree of Souls that holds the spiritual and genetic fabric of the race. And who best to help them but Jack Scully, the paraplegic ex-Marine avatar who has found acceptance among the literally connects to their beings and creatures. Sam Worthington, the Australian actor who plays him, is a study of a reserved man longing for an inner life.<br/><br/>The plot moves with agility and dramatic logic, culminating in an epic battle between the rapacious villains and the noble Pandorans, who during a crucial battle find their deus ex machina in their wild creatures. The skillfully managed war sequences evoke images from the Vietnam War and America's allegedly oil-motivated wars.<br/><br/>It was only the other day when we journeyed to Munchkinland in the Land of Oz, and only yesterday when George Lucas was transporting us to unknown worlds in galaxies far, far away, to new places and the bizarre creatures inhabiting them. Today, through computer graphic imaging, \"Avatar\" takes us back home, but to a home that we never had and never will have, not even one that we can hope to have.<br/><br/>The imagined landscape of Pandora and the totally digitized creation of the Na'vi giants are the reasons why the movie will be a durable audience-pleaser for a long time. The planet comes across as a pastiche of Earth's mountain ranges, cliffs and lush rain forests. Except that the mountains defy gravity, floating up to the sky, connected to the lower strata by gigantic vines where Scully's avatar and his Na'vi love Neytiri (an aristocratic Zoë Saldana) can navigate with feline grace. The sky-scape of islands on air is a nod to Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki's \"Princess Mononoke.\"<br/><br/>And the plants and beasts appear to be products of several million-year evolutions, or those of a creator who was having a bad day, mixing up their DNAs, resulting in bioluminescent land-based jellyfish, pterodactyls with the beaks of ducks and gills of sharks, and collages of manatee and elephant body parts topped with hammerhead whales' craniums.<br/><br/>Whether they are giving life to flora or fauna, the computer graphics are meticulous down to the last pixel, the tones realistic and the textures palpable. One can even notice the stains on the ivory teeth of a dragon-like creature's fossil. The same care had gone into the creation of the Na'vi beings: elongated torsos and limbs, ultra-slim waists, wiggly ears, hair locks and costume accessories, this last seemingly a collection of those worn by African, Asian and American indigenous tribes.<br/><br/>But for all the attention to detail, or maybe because of Cameron's mythic intent, the movie missed endowing the Na'vis with a clear culture, hinting only at their hierarchical customs and cult-like rituals performed around the Tree of Souls, with rhythmic chants and ecstatic flailing of hair locks. How do they live? Where are the kids? Except for one bite of a fig-like fruit, we get no glimpse of what foods nourish them. There are two especially whimsical visual touches. One is the bonding between Na'vi and Na'vi, or between Na'vi and beast through the tips of their tails, which are equipped with squiggly nematode-like filaments. In one scene, the coupling becomes overtly sexual. The other image is the suspended lacy hammock that gently ensconces a sleepy warrior at slumber time. <br/><br/>The first and only \"Avatar\" I've seen is the Special Edition, not in IMAX but in 3D. It took me quite a while to enjoy the wonders of 3D, being somewhat bothered by the random blurring of image details in certain frames, apparently not caused by shifts in the depth of field. As for the extra nine minutes added or restored to the original, I doubt very much that they make any difference. <br/><br/>Should \"Avatar\" have won over \"The Hurt Locker\" in the Oscars? The question is academic. Unlike a certain winter sport, to make a clumsy analogy, judging films is not a mere factoring of technical brilliance and artistic merits, calculated to the last decimal point. When Academy members vote, their knowledge, taste and intuition are their only guide. \"Avatar\" may be miles ahead in technical brilliance, and its humble rival may be miles ahead in artistry. But when the accountants split the difference, David slew Goliath.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">OK first of all let me state...James Camron has made some of the best movies of the 20th century in my opinion. Aliens, The Terminator 1 and 2 Titanic, all of which are great movies. So I'm not here to bash Camron or his work. But I was less than impressed with Avatar.<br/><br/>Perhaps the over hyping of this movie made me watch it with higher expectations that I should have had. Perhaps impossible expectations. But none the less. One thing about this movie that irked me right away was the recycled sound effects...A movie of this SIZE and SCALE used recycled sound effects? Many of the animals encountered in this movie sound exactly like the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park. The animation of everything was good...But it didn't blow me away like I hoped it would.<br/><br/>Now the bad...<br/><br/>The story...So unoriginal I almost couldn't stand it. It has this overwhelming ''save the earth'' message to it which I would rather not have crammed down my throat. It also reminds us that we ''Human beings'' are the aids of planet slowly and methodically killing the earth. Story alone gets a 2/10 score for me.<br/><br/>Overall I can't rate this movie any higher than 5/10. I wish that I could. But I just wasn't as impressed by at is I felt I should have been.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I feel like Avatar and Gravity make extremely interesting companion pieces in juxtaposition. Both receiving a lot of hype massive hype ahead of release but essentially suffering from the same pitfalls, amazing resounding bark, very little bite.<br/><br/>I must say though I did find myself more gripped by the vast scope of Avatar, what James Cameron has on offer here is are tactile and strangely relatable visual experiences. That coupled with the incredible sound design and James Horner's pleasantly inspired score makes Avatar something that actually offers a sense of grounded escapism. Much has been said about the narrative, it's the age old archetype myth, entirely worn ground and it does make sense I feel but only to a certain level. However, I felt it propelled the movie to impress more and more on a technical level. The dialogue isn't very well crafted and massively clunky in places. Once the third act kicks in you are rather gripped by the precision of the cuts and the orchestration of this big epic action sequence, it rattles on to a fittingly breezy conclusion.<br/><br/>I would be remiss however not to point out that this was Cameron's first feature in thirteen years after the monstrously successful Titanic, was this the best he could do? It's seemingly also taking him six years to follow it up. Is he really such a maestro that it takes him eons to make decent event films, perhaps scaling it down would find him more suited. Watching this years after first seeing it during it's theatrical release you do begin to see how dated the visuals have become already, so soon. You don't really get that with physical practical effects movies. It's a shame too that this was the film that caused exhibitors to scrap film projectors in favour of big digital cinema systems, which in turn would force Hollywood to produce films to cater towards these packages.<br/><br/>In conclusion, good but more of a nefarious industrial presentation than a majestic work of cinema.<br/><br/>P.S. Unobtanium? Really?</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">It's a \"stonker\", An animated classic (or largely animated/CGI anyway) Visually its Roger Dean meets Predator. Plot wise it's Battle for Terra or Pocahontas or Dances with wolves or any of those many other North American angst films where they make a film which canonizes a main character who see's the light in time to try manfully to stop the destruction of a harmonious existence in sympathy with the greatest and most spectacular environment in the world, for material gain. . . <br/><br/>Then having sat on their big fat American butts for over 2 hours, they all stream out to sink their identical bleached straightened teeth into burgers made from cattle reared on ex amazonian rain forest, the makers of which have more than likely invested in the movie.<br/><br/>Let's face it we couldn't make movies with plots like this 60 years ago because then it wasn't too late to save just a few of the aboriginal cultures who did live in harmony with their natural surroundings; And we would have felt uncomfortable watching it then going home and doing nothing. Now that we can't save 'em anyway. Every other film seems to have this same near identical theme and we can watch them all with a clear conscience, dream of better ways of life and wish they hadn't all been \"civilized\" and buried by our granddad's. Forgetting for a moment that most of those cultures who nearly froze to death every winter and almost starved if pests or disease destroyed their diet in the summer, were only too keen in the end to \"track\" their dinner down in Wal-Mart, grow a big fat butt and plant it on a comfy chair whilst someone not wearing a leopard headdress with a bone through their nose fitted a brace to their kids crooked teeth.<br/><br/>It's a lovely film beautifully created and whilst there isn't a single original element in the plot, those stolen elements have been put together beautifully and in a setting which may well take your mind right off it anyway. Was StarWars any the worse for combining \"Lord of the Rings\" with \"633 Squadron\" or Dambusters and when was the last truly original film you did see?<br/><br/>This is also the first largely CGI film in which I haven't found the motion of jumping and falling figures a giveaway. \"Ironman\" was good. Way better than \"Spiderman 2\"; but there were still some moments when you thought \"that didn't seem quite natural\". Avatar has little or non of that, and thats a massive achievement as the film has a far greater quantity of that kind of movement by a far greater number and variety of figures simultaneously than in either of the two previously mentioned movies. In that respect alone it should go down as a milestone in film evolution.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">I'll admit I was slightly hesitant about seeing Avatar, saturated as it was with an enormous build-up and crazed reviews heralding it as the next great step in film-making. However, I think it's important to have one's own opinions of movies like this, as it would be easy to become prejudiced against them owing to the deluge of commercial hype. And I was pleased that I did choose to see it, especially as James Cameron's terrific special effects are surely best viewed on the big screen with the aid of 3D.<br/><br/>And surely the special effects are the key feature of the film. The sheer time, skill and - of course - expense that has gone into the creation of the visuals in Avatar must be unprecedented, and the way in which live action and CGI are brought together is completely new. Rightly, these effects are made the focal point of the film and as much time as possible is given over to showcasing the amazing animation. Some of the action scenes are truly awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>However, it would be wrong to say that Avatar totally lived up to its hype. In many ways it's a very basic action film and whilst it will undoubtedly be festooned with awards on the technical side, the actors are unlikely to get anything more then reflected praise. In some ways, I think it was a deliberate choice to make the actors almost a secondary part of the movie so as not to take away from the visual experience. Sam Worthington is a reasonable tough-guy leading man, but is pretty much personality-free, while Sigourney Weaver is probably miscast as his experienced scientist mentor. That said, they are not helped by a grimly banal script which falls down in all its attempts at humour or wisecracks. Honourable mentions should go, though, to Giovanni Ribisi and Stephen Lang who are both highly watchable in the two lead bad guy roles.<br/><br/>But I think what really stops this film from truly excelling is the plot. Some might argue that the story is not vital in this type of film, but I can't help but feel that a more original and gripping plot could have pushed this film into a higher echelon. Without giving too much away, Avatar has an extremely strong resemblance to Dances With Wolves in many ways, yet in a kind of watered-down and more superficial way. Understandable, I suppose, as the target audience for Avatar is younger. But for an older audience hoping to see a wholly original piece, this may prove a stumbling block.<br/><br/>I suppose the final point to make about Avatar, and films like it, is to wonder just how far films really can be improved by CGI and effects in general. In this case, hundreds of CGI technicians and animators have spent an inordinate amount of time creating an amazing visual world with characters to inhabit it and for that they should be applauded. But have they actually created a new film? Something we hadn't seen or considered before? Personally, I don't think so. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think it does suggest that there are limits to what great effects can add to a film beyond what human beings and their emotions can.<br/><br/>Avatar is a ground-breaking venture in many ways and delivers solidly as a mega-budget, formulaic action adventure with literally stunning special effects. Will it prove as influential as Star Wars? Probably not. Will it change cinema forever? Unlikely. But the hyperbole that surrounded its release shouldn't stop anyone from appreciating what it does have to offer.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Deja-vu anyone? Overblown budget, cutting edge special effects, rumors that Cameron had lost the plot, rumors that this was to be an Ishtar for the ages. Yes, history seemed to be repeating itself during the shoot for James Cameron's latest eye popping thrill ride Avatar. But instead of sinking like the ship in Cameron's now comically iconic predecessor, Avatar comes up trumps.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington stars as Jake Sulley, a paraplegic marine who is promised the use of his legs back in exchange for infiltrating the community of the native people of planet Pandora and gathering information to necessitate their downfall. As he grows to love his new way of life Sulley becomes conflicted between following orders and protecting his new people.<br/><br/>I didn't expect to like this film. In fact i expected to hate it considering Avatar combines two of my least favorite genres- science fiction and animation-coupled with a mammoth running time. But James Cameron has managed to create such a visually magnificent feast for the eyes that you would be hard pressed not to become engaged by what is playing out before you.<br/><br/>Cameron takes the art of motion capture CGI to new heights of excellence, producing quality of colour and dimension the likes of which has yet to be seen. The planet of Pandora is an exotic paradise, so lush with native flora and fauna that you long to jump through the screen and touch it. The animated characters are more emotive and realistic than ever before thanks to this new technology which allows every nuance of the actor's facial expressions to be captured and transferred onto the screen.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington does well in the lead. Whilst his performance is nothing exceptional, he makes a solid effort at holding the film together. The fact that you are always routing for Sulley despite his conflicted loyalties is a testament to Worthington's likability. However the real show stealer is Zoe Saldana, quite a feat considering her character is entirely animated. As Neytiri, Jake's Na'vi love interest Saldana's emotions are so incredibly powerful that they blast straight through the screen, enabling the audience to relate to the film on a much more basic human level. Another notable mention has to go to Sigourney Weaver, re-teaming with the man who brought her initial super stardom twenty-three years ago, she plays Dr Grace Augustine, a scientist with an innate love for the native people of Pandora. Her performance reminds us why she is one of the best actresses around for bringing strong, independent female characters to life on the big screen. Rounding out the cast is Stephen Lang as the larger than life, ultimate film villain Colonel Miles Quaritch. Lang hams it up big time, but this serves the character well.<br/><br/>The majority of Avatar's appeal lays within the visual aspects of the film. Cameron's script is not great. The dialogue is rather bland and the story formulaic. The nearly three hour running time is mainly for visual showcasing rather than allowing the quite simple plot to unfold. The films underlying themes of corporate greed, science and religion and the adverse affect of man on nature are hammered home in a loud and obvious way. Yet Avatar still possesses more of an emotional pull than most big budgeted action epics manage to communicate.<br/><br/>This film may not be for everyone, but even Cameron's greatest cynics must give the man props for his vision. If you dislike the genre the running time might get to you, but even so you'd be hard pressed not to feel like you got plenty of bang for your buck.

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control clickable\">Avatar is clearly the movie of this year, featuring visuals so vibrant that they are beautiful enough to make you weep. Combine that with a motion capture technology that actually works and you have something special. If you want a comparison go view Robert Zemeckis' \"A Christmas Carol\" done for Disney. That film featured CGI figures that were not emotive and eerily conjured visions of soul-dead zombies. In contrast, Cameron provides characters that seem to be living breathing individuals.<br/><br/>Since there is nothing to criticize in the visual area, people have concentrated on the story telling of this feature. They seem to forget that this is a genre piece that pretty much closely adheres to the conventions of heroic fantasy. These include: (1) An outsider or low-born individual who will rise to the top. (2)He will eventually wed the unobtainable beautiful queen or princess in contradiction of cultural norms and expectations. (3)He (it is almost always a he) will justify his rise in prominence by fulfilling a prophecy or legend that results in the salvation of either his people or his newly adopted people. Is this an original tale? No. Go to any book store and in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy aisle you can find tons of slight variations of this tale. These tales would include the Lord of the Rings, The Sword of Truth, The Wheel of Time, and The Song of Fire and Ice among their many volumes. While there are dozens of dozens of similar tales, these are the well-done titles of exemplars. This is what Avatar is--a genre film that has been realized to the nth degree. If you are looking for more creativity, you'll have to await the sequels.<br/><br/>Accept this film for what it is and you'll not be disappointed in any way. James Cameron did not attempt a genre busting film, he fully embraced the genre and then knocked it out of the park.</div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I do not know what all the fuss is with this film, I did not see it in the cinema so maybe the sfx dont translate to the small screen and blu ray. Felt like I was watching the scripted parts of a video game, and acting very mediocre.\n",
       " However biggest gripe I have is it's a blatant big budget version of Fern Gulley the Last Rain Forest, just swap the blue aliens for fairies and it's the same movie.</div>,\n",
